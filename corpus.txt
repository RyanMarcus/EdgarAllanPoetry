the raven
once upon a midnight dreary, while i pondered, weak and weary,
over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore
while i nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
as of some one gently rappingrapping at my chamber door
tis some visitor, i muttered, tapping at my chamber door
only this and nothing more
ah, distinctly i remember, it was in the bleak december,
and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
eagerly i wished the morrowvainly i had sought to borrow
from my books surcease of sorrowsorrow for the lost lenore
for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore
nameless here for evermore
and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
thrilled mefilled me with fantastic terrors never felt before
so that now, to still the beating of my heart, i stood repeating
tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door
some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door
this it is and nothing more
presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer,
sir, said i, or madam, truly your forgiveness i implore
but the fact is i was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
and so faintly you came tappingtapping at my chamber door,
that i scarce was sure i heard youhere i opened wide the door
darkness there and nothing more
deep into that darkness peering, long i stood there wondering,
fearing,
doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before
but the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,
and the only word there spoken was the whispered word, lenore
this i whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, lenore
merely this and nothing more
back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
soon i heard again a tapping, somewhat louder than before
surely, said i, surely that is something at my window lattice
let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore
let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore
tis the wind and nothing more
open here i flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore
not the least obeisance made he not an instant stopped or stayed he
but, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door
perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door
perched, and sat, and nothing more
then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou, i said, art sure no
craven,
ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore
tell me what thy lordly name is on the nights plutonian shore
quoth the raven, nevermore
much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
though its answer little meaninglittle relevancy bore
for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door
bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
with such name as nevermore
but the raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only
that one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour
nothing further then he utterednot a feather then he fluttered
till i scarcely more than muttered, other friends have flown before
on the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before
then the bird said, nevermore
startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
doubtless, said i, what it utters is its only stock and store,
caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster
followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore
till the dirges of his hope the melancholy burden bore
of nevernevermore
but the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and
door
then, upon the velvet sinking, i betook myself to linking
fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore
what this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
meant in croaking nevermore
this i sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms core
this and more i sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
on the cushions velvet lining that the lamplight gloated oer,
but whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating oer,
she shall press, ah, nevermore
then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
swung by seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor
wretch, i cried, thy god hath lent theeby these angels he hath
sent thee
respiterespite aad nepenth from thy memories of lenore
quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenth, and forget this lost lenore
quoth the raven, nevermore
prophet said i, thing of evilprophet still, if bird or devil
whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted
on this home by horror hauntedtell me truly, i implore
is thereis there balm in gilead?tell metell me, i implore
quoth the raven, nevermore
prophet said i, thing of evilprophet still, if bird or devil
by that heaven that bends above usby that god we both adore
tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant aidenn,
it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore
clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore
quoth the raven, nevermore
be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend i shrieked,
upstarting
get thee back into the tempest and the nights plutonian shore
leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken
leave my loneliness unbrokenquit the bust above my door
take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door
quoth the raven, nevermore
and the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door
and his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming,
and the lamplight oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor
and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
shall be liftednevermore

the bells,
i
hear the sledges with the bells
silver bells
what a world of merriment their melody foretells
how they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,
in their icy air of night
while the stars, that oversprinkle
all the heavens, seem to twinkle
with a crystalline delight
keeping time, time, time,
in a sort of runic rhyme,
to the tintinnabulation that so musically wells
from the bells, bells, bells, bells,
bells, bells, bells
from the jingling and the tinkling of the bells
ii
hear the mellow wedding bells,
golden bells
what a world of happiness their harmony foretells
through the balmy air of night
how they ring out their delight
from the molten goldennotes,
and all in tune,
what a liquid ditty floats
to the turtledove that listens, while she gloats
on the moon
oh, from out the sounding cells,
what a gush of euphony voluminously wells
how it swells
how it dwells
on the future how it tells
of the rapture that impels
to the swinging and the ringing
of the bells, bells, bells,
of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
bells, bells, bells
to the rhyming and the chiming of the bells
iii
hear the loud alarum bells
brazen bells
what a tale of terror now their turbulency tells
in the startled ear of night
how they scream out their affright
too much horrified to speak,
they can only shriek, shriek,
out of tune,
in a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,
in a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire
leaping higher, higher, higher,
with a desperate desire,
and a resolute endeavor
nownow to sit or never,
by the side of the palefaced moon
oh, the bells, bells, bells
what a tale their terror tells
of despair
how they clang, and clash, and roar
what a horror they outpour
on the bosom of the palpitating air
yet the ear it fully knows,
by the twanging,
and the clanging,
how the danger ebbs and flows
yet the ear distinctly tells,
in the jangling,
and the wrangling,
how the danger sinks and swells,
by the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells
of the bells
of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
bells, bells, bells
in the clamor and the clangor of the bells
iv
hear the tolling of the bells
iron bells
what a world of solemn thought their monody compels
in the silence of the night,
how we shiver with affright
at the melancholy menace of their tone
for every sound that floats
from the rust within their throats
is a groan
and the peopleah, the people
they that dwell up in the steeple
all alone,
and who toiling, toiling, toiling,
in that muffled monotone,
feel a glory in so rolling
on the human heart a stone
they are neither man nor woman
they are neither brute nor human
they are ghouls
and their king it is who tolls
and he rolls, rolls, rolls,
rolls
a pan from the bells
and his merry bosom swells
with the pan of the bells
and he dances, and he yells
keeping time, time, time,
in a sort of runic rhyme,
to the pan of the bells
of the bells
keeping time, time, time,
in a sort of runic rhyme,
to the throbbing of the bells
of the bells, bells, bells
to the sobbing of the bells
keeping time, time, time,
as he knells, knells, knells,
in a happy runic rhyme,
to the rolling of the bells
of the bells, bells, bells
to the tolling of the bells,
of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
bells, bells, bells
to the moaning and the groaning of the bells


ulalume
the skies they were ashen and sober
the leaves they were crisped and sere
the leaves they were withering and sere
it was night in the lonesome october
of my most immemorial year
it was hard by the dim lake of auber,
in the misty mid region of weir
it was down by the dank tarn of auber,
in the ghoulhaunted woodland of weir
here once, through an alley titanic
of cypress, i roamed with my soul
of cypress, with psyche, my soul
these were days when my heart was volcanic
as the scoriac rivers that roll
as the lavas that restlessly roll
their sulphurous currents down yaanek
in the ultimate climes of the pole
that groan as they roll down mount yaanek
in the realms of the boreal pole
our talk had been serious and sober,
but our thoughts they were palsied and sere
our memories were treacherous and sere
for we knew not the month was october,
and we marked not the night of the year
ah, night of all nights in the year
we noted not the dim lake of auber
though once we had journeyed down here
remembered not the dank tarn of auber,
nor the ghoulhaunted woodland of weir
and now as the night was senescent
and stardials pointed to morn
as the sundials hinted of morn
at the end of our path a liquescent
and nebulous lustre was born,
out of which a miraculous crescent
arose with a duplicate horn
astartes bediamonded crescent
distinct with its duplicate horn
and i saidshe is warmer than dian
she rolls through an ether of sighs
she revels in a region of sighs
she has seen that the tears are not dry on
these cheeks, where the worm never dies,
and has come past the stars of the lion
to point us the path to the skies
to the lethean peace of the skies
come up, in despite of the lion,
to shine on us with her bright eyes
come up through the lair of the lion,
with love in her luminous eyes
but psyche, uplifting her finger,
saidsadly this star i mistrust
her pallor i strangely mistrust
oh, hastenoh, let us not linger
oh, flylet us flyfor we must
in terror she spoke, letting sink her
wings till they trailed in the dust
in agony sobbed, letting sink her
plumes till they trailed in the dust
till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust
i repliedthis is nothing but dreaming
let us on by this tremulous light
let us bathe in this crystalline light
its sibyllic splendor is beaming
with hope and in beauty tonight
seeit flickers up the sky through the night
ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,
and be sure it will lead us aright
we safely may trust to a gleaming
that cannot but guide us aright,
since it flickers up to heaven through the night
thus i pacified psyche and kissed her,
and tempted her out of her gloom
and conquered her scruples and gloom
and we passed to the end of a vista,
but were stopped by the door of a tomb
by the door of a legended tomb
and i saidwhat is written, sweet sister,
on the door of this legended tomb?
she repliedulalumeulalume
tis the vault of thy lost ulalume
then my heart it grew ashen and sober
as the leaves that were crisped and sere
as the leaves that were withering and sere
and i criedit was surely october
on this very night of last year
that i journeyedi journeyed down here
that i brought a dread burden down here
on this night of all nights in the year,
ah, what demon has tempted me here?
well i know, now, this dim lake of auber
this misty mid region of weir
well i know, now, this dank tarn of auber,
this ghoulhaunted woodland of weir


to helen
i saw thee onceonce onlyyears ago
i must not say how manybut not many
it was a july midnight and from out
a fullorbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring,
sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,
there fell a silverysilken veil of light,
with quietude, and sultriness and slumber,
upon the upturnd faces of a thousand
roses that grew in an enchanted garden,
where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe
fell on the upturnd faces of these roses
that gave out, in return for the lovelight,
their odorous souls in an ecstatic death
fell on the upturnd faces of these roses
that smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted
by thee, and by the poetry of thy presence
clad all in white, upon a violet bank
i saw thee halfreclining while the moon
fell on the upturnd faces of the roses,
and on thine own, upturndalas, in sorrow
was it not fate, that, on this july midnight
was it not fate whose name is also sorrow,
that bade me pause before that gardengate,
to breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?
no footstep stirred the hated world all slept,
save only thee and meo heaveno god
how my heart beats in coupling those two words
save only thee and me i pausedi looked
and in an instant all things disappeared
ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted
the pearly lustre of the moon went out
the mossy banks and the meandering paths,
the happy flowers and the repining trees,
were seen no more the very roses odors
died in the arms of the adoring airs
allall expired save theesave less than thou
save only the divine light in thine eyes
save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes
i saw but themthey were the world to me
i saw but themsaw only them for hours
saw only them until the moon went down
what wild hearthistories seemed to lie unwritten
upon those crystalline, celestial spheres
how dark a woe yet how sublime a hope
how silently serene a sea of pride
how daring an ambition yet how deep
how fathomless a capacity for love
but now, at length, dear dian sank from sight,
into a western couch of thundercloud
and thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees
didst glide away only thine eyes remained
they would not gothey never yet have gone
lighting my lonely pathway home that night,
they have not left me as my hopes have since
they follow methey lead me through the years
they are my ministersyet i their slave
their office is to illumine and enkindle
my duty, to be saved by their bright light,
and purified in their electric fire,
and sanctified in their elysian fire
they fill my soul with beauty which is hope,
and are far up in heaventhe stars i kneel to
in the sad, silent watches of my night
while even in the meridian glare of day
i see them stilltwo sweetly scintillant
venuses, unextinguished by the sun


annabel lee
it was many and many a year ago,
in a kingdom by the sea,
that a maiden there lived whom you may know
by the name of annabel lee
and this maiden she lived with no other thought
than to love and be loved by me
i was a child and she was a child,
in this kingdom by the sea
but we loved with a love that was more than love
i and my annabel lee
with a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
coveted her and me
and this was the reason that, long ago,
in this kingdom by the sea,
a wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
my beautiful annabel lee
so that her highborn kinsmen came
and bore her away from me,
to shut her up in a sepulchre
in this kingdom by the sea
the angels, not half so happy in heaven,
went envying her and me
yesthat was the reason as all men know,
in this kingdom by the sea
that the wind came out of the cloud by night,
chilling and killing my annabel lee
but our love it was stronger by far than the love
of those who were older than we
of many far wiser than we
and neither the angels in heaven above,
nor the demons down under the sea,
can ever dissever my soul from the soul
of the beautiful annabel lee
for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
of the beautiful annabel lee
and the stars never rise but i see the bright eyes
of the beautiful annabel lee
and so, all the nighttide, i lie down by the side
of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride,
in her sepulchre there by the sea
in her tomb by the side of the sea

and yet there is in this no gordian knot

seldom we find, says solomon don dunce,
half an idea in the profoundest sonnet

to my mother
because i feel that, in the heavens above,
the angels, whispering to one another,
can find, among their burning terms of love,
none so devotional as that of mother,
therefore by that dear name i long have called you
you who are more than mother unto me,
and fill my heart of hearts, where death installed you,
in setting my virginias spirit free
my mothermy own mother, who died early,
was but the mother of myself but you
are mother to the one i loved so dearly,
and thus are dearer than the mother i knew
by that infinity with which my wife
was dearer to my soul than its soullife

the above was addressed to the poets motherinlaw, mrs clemmed

for annie
thank heaven the crisis
the danger is past,
and the lingering illness
is over at last
and the fever called living
is conquered at last
sadly, i know,
i am shorn of my strength,
and no muscle i move
as i lie at full length
but no matteri feel
i am better at length
and i rest so composedly,
now in my bed,
that any beholder
might fancy me dead
might start at beholding me
thinking me dead
the moaning and groaning,
the sighing and sobbing,
are quieted now,
with that horrible throbbing
at heartah, that horrible,
horrible throbbing
the sicknessthe nausea
the pitiless pain
have ceased, with the fever
that maddened my brain
with the fever called living
that burned in my brain
and oh of all tortures
that torture the worst
has abatedthe terrible
torture of thirst,
for the naphthaline river
of passion accurst
i have drank of a water
that quenches all thirst
of a water that flows,
with a lullaby sound,
from a spring but a very few
feet under ground
from a cavern not very far
down under ground
and ah let it never
be foolishly said
that my room it is gloomy
and narrow my bed
for man never slept
in a different bed
and, to sleep, you must slumber
in just such a bed
my tantalized spirit
here blandly reposes,
forgetting, or never
regretting its roses
its old agitations
of myrtles and roses
for now, while so quietly
lying, it fancies
a holier odor
about it, of pansies
a rosemary odor,
commingled with pansies
with rue and the beautiful
puritan pansies
and so it lies happily,
bathing in many
a dream of the truth
and the beauty of annie
drowned in a bath
of the tresses of annie
she tenderly kissed me,
she fondly caressed,
and then i fell gently
to sleep on her breast
deeply to sleep
from the heaven of her breast
when the light was extinguished,
she covered me warm,
and she prayed to the angels
to keep me from harm
to the queen of the angels
to shield me from harm
and i lie so composedly,
now in my bed
knowing her love
that you fancy me dead
and i rest so contentedly,
now in my bed,
with her love at my breast
that you fancy me dead
that you shudder to look at me
thinking me dead
but my heart it is brighter
than all of the many
stars in the sky,
for it sparkles with annie
it glows with the light
of the love of my annie
with the thought of the light
of the eyes of my annie


to f
beloved amid the earnest woes
that crowd around my earthly path
drear path, alas where grows
not even one lonely rose
my soul at least a solace hath
in dreams of thee, and therein knows
an eden of bland repose
and thus thy memory is to me
like some enchanted faroff isle
in some tumultuous sea
some ocean throbbing far and free
with stormbut where meanwhile
serenest skies continually
just oer that one bright inland smile


to frances s osgood
thou wouldst be loved?then let thy heart
from its present pathway part not
being everything which now thou art,
be nothing which thou art not
so with the world thy gentle ways,
thy grace, thy more than beauty,
shall be an endless theme of praise
and love a simple duty


eldorado
gaily bedight,
a gallant knight,
in sunshine and in shadow,
had journeyed long,
singing a song,
in search of eldorado
but he grew old
this knight so bold
and oer his heart a shadow
fell as he found
no spot of ground
that looked like eldorado
and, as his strength
failed him at length,
he met a pilgrim shadow
shadow, said he,
where can it be
this land of eldorado?
over the mountains
of the moon,
down the valley of the shadow,
ride, boldly ride,
the shade replied,
if you seek for eldorado


eulalie
i dwelt alone
in a world of moan,
and my soul was a stagnant tide,
till the fair and gentle eulalie became my blushing bride
till the yellowhaired young eulalie became my smiling bride
ah, lessless bright
the stars of the night
than the eyes of the radiant girl
and never a flake
that the vapor can make
with the moontints of purple and pearl,
can vie with the modest eulalies most unregarded curl
can compare with the brighteyed eulalies most humble and careless
curl
now doubtnow pain
come never again,
for her soul gives me sigh for sigh,
and all day long
shines, bright and strong,
astart within the sky,
while ever to her dear eulalie upturns her matron eye
while ever to her young eulalie upturns her violet eye


a dream within a dream
take this kiss upon the brow
and, in parting from you now,
thus much let me avow
you are not wrong, who deem
that my days have been a dream
yet if hope has flown away
in a night, or in a day,
in a vision or in none,
is it therefore the less gone?
all that we see or seem
is but a dream within a dream
i stand amid the roar
of a surftormented shore,
and i hold within my hand
grains of the golden sand
how few yet how they creep
through my fingers to the deep
while i weepwhile i weep
o god can i not grasp
them with a tighter clasp?
o god can i not save
one from the pitiless wave?
is all that we see or seem
but a dream within a dream?


to marie louise shew
of all who hail thy presence as the morning
of all to whom thine absence is the night
the blotting utterly from out high heaven
the sacred sunof all who, weeping, bless thee
hourly for hopefor lifeah, above all,
for the resurrection of deep buried faith
in truth, in virtue, in humanity
of all who, on despairs unhallowed bed
lying down to die, have suddenly arisen
at thy softmurmured words, let there be light
at thy softmurmured words that were fulfilled
in thy seraphic glancing of thine eyes
of all who owe thee most, whose gratitude
nearest resembles worship,oh, remember
the truest, the most fervently devoted,
and think that these weak lines are written by him
by him who, as he pens them, thrills to think
his spirit is communing with an angels


to marie louise shew
not long ago, the writer of these lines,
in the mad pride of intellectuality,
maintained the power of wordsdenied that ever
a thought arose within the human brain
beyond the utterance of the human tongue
and now, as if in mockery of that boast,
two wordstwo foreign soft dissyllables
italian tones, made only to be murmured
by angels dreaming in the moonlit dew
that hangs like chains of pearl on hermon hill,
have stirred from out the abysses of his heart,
unthoughtlike thoughts that are the souls of thought,
richer, far wilder, far diviner visions
than even the seraph harper, israfel,
who has the sweetest voice of all gods creatures,
could hope to utter and i my spells are broken
the pen falls powerless from my shivering hand
with thy dear name as text, though hidden by thee,
i cannot writei cannot speak or think
alas, i cannot feel for tis not feeling,
this standing motionless upon the golden
threshold of the wideopen gate of dreams,
gazing, entranced, adown the gorgeous vista,
and thrilling as i see, upon the right,
upon the left, and all the way along,
amid empurpled vapors, far away
to where the prospect terminatesthee only

the city in the sea
lo death has reared himself a throne
in a strange city lying alone
far down within the dim west,
where the good and the bad and the worst and the best
have gone to their eternal rest
there shrines and palaces and towers
timeeaten towers and tremble not
resemble nothing that is ours
around, by lifting winds forgot,
resignedly beneath the sky
the melancholy waters lie
no rays from the holy heaven come down
on the long nighttime of that town
but light from out the lurid sea
streams up the turrets silently
gleams up the pinnacles far and free
up domesup spiresup kingly halls
up fanesup babylonlike walls
up shadowy longforgotten bowers
of sculptured ivy and stone flowers
up many and many a marvellous shrine
whose wreathed friezes intertwine
the viol, the violet, and the vine
resignedly beneath the sky
the melancholy waters lie
so blend the turrets and shadows there
that all seem pendulous in air,
while from a proud tower in the town
death looks gigantically down
there open fanes and gaping graves
yawn level with the luminous waves
but not the riches there that lie
in each idols diamond eye
not the gailyjewelled dead
tempt the waters from their bed
for no ripples curl, alas
along that wilderness of glass
no swellings tell that winds may be
upon some faroff happier sea
no heavings hint that winds have been
on seas less hideously serene
but lo, a stir is in the air
the wavethere is a movement there
as if the towers had thrust aside,
in slightly sinking, the dull tide
as if their tops had feebly given
a void within the filmy heaven
the waves have now a redder glow
the hours are breathing faint and low
and when, amid no earthly moans,
down, down that town shall settle hence,
hell, rising from a thousand thrones,
shall do it reverence
?

the sleeper
at midnight, in the month of june,
i stand beneath the mystic moon
an opiate vapor, dewy, dim,
exhales from out her golden rim,
and, softly dripping, drop by drop,
upon the quiet mountain top,
steals drowsily and musically
into the universal valley
the rosemary nods upon the grave
the lily lolls upon the wave
wrapping the fog about its breast,
the ruin moulders into rest
looking like lethe, see the lake
a conscious slumber seems to take,
and would not, for the world, awake
all beauty sleepsand lo where lies
her casement open to the skies
irene, with her destinies
oh, lady bright can it be right
this window open to the night
the wanton airs, from the treetop,
laughingly through the latticedrop
the bodiless airs, a wizard rout,
flit through thy chamber in and out,
and wave the curtain canopy
so fitfullyso fearfully
above the closed and fringed lid
neath which thy slumbring soul lies hid,
that, oer the floor and down the wall,
like ghosts the shadows rise and fall
oh, lady dear, hast thou no fear?
why and what art thou dreaming here?
sure thou art come oer faroff seas,
a wonder to these garden trees
strange is thy pallor strange thy dress
strange, above all, thy length of tress,
and this allsolemn silentness
the lady sleeps oh, may her sleep
which is enduring, so be deep
heaven have her in its sacred keep
this chamber changed for one more holy,
this bed for one more melancholy,
i pray to god that she may lie
for ever with unopened eye,
while the dim sheeted ghosts go by
my love, she sleeps oh, may her sleep,
as it is lasting, so be deep
soft may the worms about her creep
far in the forest, dim and old,
for her may some tall vault unfold
some vault that oft hath flung its black
and winged panels fluttering back,
triumphant, oer the crested palls,
of her grand family funerals
some sepulchre, remote, alone,
against whose portal she hath thrown,
in childhood many an idle stone
some tomb from out whose sounding door
she neer shall force an echo more,
thrilling to think, poor child of sin
it was the dead who groaned within


bridal ballad
the ring is on my hand,
and the wreath is on my brow
satins and jewels grand
are all at my command
and i am happy now
and my lord he loves me well
but, when first he breathed his vow,
i felt my bosom swell
for the words rang as a knell,
and the voice seemed his who fell
in the battle down the dell,
and who is happy now
but he spoke to reassure me,
and he kissed my pallid brow,
while a reverie came oer me,
and to the churchyard bore me,
and i sighed to him before me,
thinking him dead delormie,
oh, i am happy now
and thus the words were spoken,
and thus the plighted vow,
and, though my faith be broken,
and, though my heart be broken,
behold the golden keys
that proves me happy now
would to god i could awaken
for i dream i know not how,
and my soul is sorely shaken
lest an evil step be taken,
lest the dead who is forsaken
may not be happy now


notes
the raven
the raven was first published on the th january, , in the new
york evening mirrora paper its author was then assistant editor of
it was prefaced by the following words, understood to have been written
by n p willis
we are permitted to copy in advance of publication from the second
number of the american review, the following remarkable poem by
edgar poe in our opinion, it is the most effective single example of
fugitive poetry ever published in this country, and unsurpassed in
english poetry for subtle conception, masterly ingenuity of
versification, and consistent sustaining of imaginative lift and
pokerishness it is one of those dainties bred in a book which we
feed on it will stick to the memory of everybody who reads it
in the february number of the american review the poem was published
as by quarles, and it was introduced by the following note, evidently
suggested if not written by poe himself
the following lines from a correspondentbesides the deep, quaint
strain of the sentiment, and the curious introduction of some
ludicrous touches amidst the serious and impressive, as was doubtless
intended by the authorappears to us one of the most felicitous
specimens of unique rhyming which has for some time met our eye the
resources of english rhythm for varieties of melody, measure, and
sound, producing corresponding diversities of effect, have been
thoroughly studied, much more perceived, by very few poets in the
language while the classic tongues, especially the greek, possess, by
power of accent, several advantages for versification over our own,
chiefly through greater abundance of spondaic feet, we have other and
very great advantages of sound by the modern usage of rhyme
alliteration is nearly the only effect of that kind which the ancients
had in common with us it will be seen that much of the melody of the
raven arises from alliteration and the studious use of similar sounds
in unusual places in regard to its measure, it may be noted that if
all the verses were like the second, they might properly be placed
merely in short lines, producing a not uncommon form but the presence
in all the others of one linemostly the second in the verse
stanza?which flows continuously, with only an aspirate pause in
the middle, like that before the short line in the sapphio adonic,
while the fifth has at the middle pause no similarity of sound with
any part beside, gives the versification an entirely different effect
we could wish the capacities of our noble language in prosody were
better understood

the bells
the bibliographical history of the bells is curious the subject, and
some lines of the original version, having been suggested by the poets
friend, mrs shew, poe, when he wrote out the first draft of the poem,
headed it, the bells by mrs m a shew this draft, now the editors
property, consists of only seventeen lines, and reads thus
i
the bellsah the bells
the little silver bells
how fairylike a melody there floats
from their throats
from their merry little throats
from the silver, tinkling throats
of the bells, bells, bells
of the bells
ii
the bellsah, the bells
the heavy iron bells
how horrible a monody there floats
from their throats
from their deeptoned throats
from their melancholy throats

poems of manhood

lenore
ah, broken is the golden bowl the spirit flown forever
let the bell tolla saintly soul floats on the stygian river
and, guy de vere, hast thou no tear?weep now or never more
see on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, lenore
come let the burial rite be readthe funeral song be sung
an anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young
a dirge for her, the doubly dead in that she died so young
wretches ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride,
and when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed herthat she died
how shall the ritual, then, be read?the requiem how be sung
by youby yours, the evil eye,by yours, the slanderous tongue
that did to death the innocence that died, and died so young?
peccavimus but rave not thus and let a sabbath song
go up to god so solemnly the dead may feel no wrong
the sweet lenore hath gone before, with hope, that flew beside,
leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy bride
for her, the fair and dbonnaire, that now so lowly lies,
the life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes
the life still there, upon her hairthe death upon her eyes
avaunt tonight my heart is light no dirge will i upraise,
but waft the angel on her flight with a pan of old days
let no bell tolllest her sweet soul, amid its hallowed mirth,
should catch the note, as it doth float up from the damned earth
to friends above, from fiends below, the indignant ghost is riven
from hell unto a high estate far up within the heaven
from grief and groan to a golden throne beside the king of heaven


to one in paradise,
thou wast that all to me, love,
for which my soul did pine
a green isle in the sea, love,
a fountain and a shrine,
all wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers,
and all the flowers were mine
ah, dream too bright to last
ah, starry hope that didst arise
but to be overcast
a voice from out the future cries,
on onbut oer the past
dim gulf my spirit hovering lies
mute, motionless, aghast
for, alas alas with me
the light of life is oer
no moreno moreno more
such language holds the solemn sea
to the sands upon the shore
shall bloom the thunderblasted tree,
or the stricken eagle soar
and all my days are trances,
and all my nightly dreams
are where thy dark eye glances,
and where thy footstep gleams
in what ethereal dances,
by what eternal streams
alas for that accursed time
they bore thee oer the billow,
from love to titled age and crime,
and an unholy pillow
from me, and from our misty clime,
where weeps the silver willow


the coliseum
type of the antique rome rich reliquary
of lofty contemplation left to time
by buried centuries of pomp and power
at lengthat lengthafter so many days
of weary pilgrimage and burning thirst,
thirst for the springs of lore that in thee lie,
i kneel, an altered and an humble man,
amid thy shadows, and so drink within
my very soul thy grandeur, gloom, and glory
vastness and age and memories of eld
silence and desolation and dim night
i feel ye nowi feel ye in your strength
o spells more sure than eer judan king
taught in the gardens of gethsemane
o charms more potent than the rapt chaldee
ever drew down from out the quiet stars
here, where a hero fell, a column falls
here, where the mimic eagle glared in gold,
a midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat
here, where the dames of rome their gilded hair
waved to the wind, now wave the reed and thistle
here, where on golden throne the monarch lolled,
glides, spectrelike, unto his marble home,
lit by the wan light of the horned moon,
the swift and silent lizard of the stones
but stay these wallsthese ivyclad arcades
these mouldering plinthsthese sad and blackened shafts
these vague entablaturesthis crumbling frieze
these shattered cornicesthis wreckthis ruin
these stonesalas these gray stonesare they all
all of the famed, and the colossal left
by the corrosive hours to fate and me?
not allthe echoes answer menot all
prophetic sounds and loud, arise forever
from us, and from all ruin, unto the wise,
as melody from memnon to the sun
we rule the hearts of mightiest menwe rule
with a despotic sway all giant minds
we are not impotentwe pallid stones
not all our power is gonenot all our fame
not all the magic of our high renown
not all the wonder that encircles us
not all the mysteries that in us lie
not all the memories that hang upon
and cling around about us as a garment,
clothing us in a robe of more than glory


the haunted palace
in the greenest of our valleys
by good angels tenanted,
once a fair and stately palace
radiant palacereared its head
in the monarch thoughts dominion
it stood there
never seraph spread a pinion
over fabric half so fair
banners yellow, glorious, golden,
on its roof did float and flow,
thisall thiswas in the olden
time long ago,
and every gentle air that dallied,
in that sweet day,
along the ramparts plumed and pallid,
a winged odor went away
wanderers in that happy valley,
through two luminous windows, saw
spirits moving musically,
to a lutes welltund law,
bound about a throne where, sitting
porphyrogene
in state his glory well befitting,
the ruler of the realm was seen
and all with pearl and ruby glowing
was the fair palace door,
through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,
and sparkling evermore,
a troop of echoes, whose sweet duty
was but to sing,
in voices of surpassing beauty,
the wit and wisdom of their king
but evil things, in robes of sorrow,
assailed the monarchs high estate
ah, let us mournfor never morrow
shall dawn upon him desolate
and round about his home the glory
that blushed and bloomed,
is but a dimremembered story
of the old time entombed
and travellers, now, within that valley,
through the redlitten windows see
vast forms, that move fantastically
to a discordant melody,
while, like a ghastly rapid river,
through the pale door
a hideous throng rush out forever
and laughbut smile no more


the conqueror worm
lo tis a gala night
within the lonesome latter years
an angel throng, bewinged, bedight
in veils, and drowned in tears,
sit in a theatre, to see
a play of hopes and fears,
while the orchestra breathes fitfully
the music of the spheres
mimes, in the form of god on high,
mutter and mumble low,
and hither and thither fly
mere puppets they, who come and go
at bidding of vast formless things
that shift the scenery to and fro,
flapping from out their condor wings
invisible wo
that motley dramaoh, be sure
it shall not be forgot
with its phantom chased for evermore,
by a crowd that seize it not,
through a circle that ever returneth in
to the selfsame spot,
and much of madness, and more of sin,
and horror the soul of the plot
but see, amid the mimic rout
a crawling shape intrude
a bloodred thing that writhes from out
the scenic solitude
it writhesit writheswith mortal pangs
the mimes become its food,
and the angels sob at vermin fangs
in human gore imbued
outout are the lightsout all
and, over each quivering form,
the curtain, a funeral pall,
comes down with the rush of a storm,
and the angels, all pallid and wan,
uprising, unveiling, affirm
that the play is the tragedy, man,
and its hero the conqueror worm


silence
there are some qualitiessome incorporate things,
that have a double life, which thus is made
a type of that twin entity which springs
from matter and light, evinced in solid and shade
there is a twofold silencesea and shore
body and soul one dwells in lonely places,
newly with grass oergrown some solemn graces,
some human memories and tearful lore,
render him terrorless his names no more
he is the corporate silence dread him not
no power hath he of evil in himself
but should some urgent fate untimely lot
bring thee to meet his shadow nameless elf,
that haunteth the lone regions where hath trod
no foot of man, commend thyself to god


dreamland
by a route obscure and lonely,
haunted by ill angels only,
where an eidolon, named night,
on a black throne reigns upright,
i have reached these lands but newly
from an ultimate dim thule
from a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime,
out of spaceout of time
bottomless vales and boundless floods,
and chasms, and caves, and titan woods,
with forms that no man can discover
for the dews that drip all over
mountains toppling evermore
into seas without a shore
seas that restlessly aspire,
surging, unto skies of fire
lakes that endlessly outspread
their lone waterslone and dead,
their still watersstill and chilly
with the snows of the lolling lily
by the lakes that thus outspread
their lone waters, lone and dead,
their sad waters, sad and chilly
with the snows of the lolling lily,
by the mountainsnear the river
murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,
by the gray woods,by the swamp
where the toad and the newt encamp,
by the dismal tarns and pools
where dwell the ghouls,
by each spot the most unholy
in each nook most melancholy,
there the traveller meets aghast
sheeted memories of the past
shrouded forms that start and sigh
as they pass the wanderer by
whiterobed forms of friends long given,
in agony, to the earthand heaven
for the heart whose woes are legion
tis a peaceful, soothing region
for the spirit that walks in shadow
tisoh, tis an eldorado
but the traveller, travelling through it,
may notdare not openly view it
never its mysteries are exposed
to the weak human eye unclosed
so wills its king, who hath forbid
the uplifting of the fringed lid
and thus the sad soul that here passes
beholds it but through darkened glasses
by a route obscure and lonely,
haunted by ill angels only
where an eidolon, named night,
on a black throne reigns upright,
i have wandered home but newly
from this ultimate dim thule


to zante
fair isle, that from the fairest of all flowers,
thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take
how many memories of what radiant hours
at sight of thee and thine at once awake
how many scenes of what departed bliss
how many thoughts of what entombed hopes
how many visions of a maiden that is
no moreno more upon thy verdant slopes
no more alas, that magical sad sound
transforming all thy charms shall please no more
thy memory no more accursed ground
henceforward i hold thy flowerenamelled shore,
o hyacinthine isle o purple zante
isola doro fior di levante


hymn
at mornat noonat twilight dim
maria thou hast heard my hymn
in joy and woin good and ill
mother of god, be with me still
when the hours flew brightly by,
and not a cloud obscured the sky,
my soul, lest it should truant be,
thy grace did guide to thine and thee
now, when storms of fate oercast
darkly my present and my past,
let my future radiant shine
with sweet hopes of thee and thine

note on politian
such portions of politian as are known to the public first saw the
light of publicity in the southern literary messenger for december
and january , being styled scenes from politian an
unpublished drama these scenes were included, unaltered, in the
collection of poems by poe the larger portion of the original draft
subsequently became the property of the present editor, but it is not
considered just to the poets memory to publish it the work is a hasty
and unrevised production of its authors earlier days of literary labor
and, beyond the scenes already known, scarcely calculated to enhance his
reputation as a specimen, however, of the parts unpublished, the
following fragment from the first scene of act ii may be offered the
duke, it should be premised, is uncle to alessandra, and father of
castiglione her betrothed
duke           why do you laugh?
castiglione    indeed
i hardly know myself stay was it not
on yesterday we were speaking of the earl?
of the earl politian? yes it was yesterday
alessandra, you and i, you must remember
we were walking in the garden
duke           perfectly
i do remember itwhat of itwhat then?
cas            o nothingnothing at all
duke           nothing at all
it is most singular that you should laugh
at nothing at all
cas            most singularsingular
duke           look yon, castiglione, be so kind
as tell me, sir, at once what tis you mean
what are you talking of?
cas            was it not so?
we differed in opinion touching him
duke           himwhom?
cas            why, sir, the earl politian
duke           the earl of leicester yesis it he you mean?
we differed, indeed if i now recollect
the words you used were that the earl you knew
was neither learned nor mirthful
cas            ha hanow did i?
duke           that did you, sir, and well i knew at the time
you were wrong, it being not the character
of the earlwhom all the world allows to be
a most hilarious man be not, my son,
too positive again
cas            tis singular
most singular i could not think it possible
so little time could so much alter one
to say the truth about an hour ago,
as i was walking with the count san ozzo,
all arm in arm, we met this very man
the earlhe, with his friend baldazzar,
having just arrived in rome ha ha he is altered
such an account he gave me of his journey
twould have made you die with laughtersuch tales he
told
of his caprices and his merry freaks
along the roadsuch odditysuch humor
such witsuch whimsuch flashes of wild merriment
set off too in such full relief by the grave
demeanor of his friendwho, to speak the truth
was gravity itself
duke           did i not tell you?
cas            you didand yet tis strange but true, as strange,
how much i was mistaken i always thought
the earl a gloomy man
duke           so, so, you see
be not too positive whom have we here?
it cannot be the earl?
cas            the earl oh no
tis not the earlbut yet it isand leaning
upon his friend baldazzar ah welcome, sir
enter politian and baldazzar
my lord, a second welcome let me give you
to romehis grace the duke of broglio
father this is the earl politian, earl
of leicester in great britain
politian bows haughtily
that, his friend
baldazzar, duke of surrey the earl has letters,
so please you, for your grace
duke           ha ha most welcome
to rome and to our palace, earl politian
and you, most noble duke i am glad to see you
i knew your father well, my lord politian
castiglione call your cousin hither,
and let me make the noble earl acquainted
with your betrothed you come, sir, at a time
most seasonable the wedding
politian       touching those letters, sir,
your son made mention ofyour son, is he not?
touching those letters, sir, i wot not of them
if such there be, my friend baldazzar here
baldazzar ahmy friend baldazzar here
will hand them to your grace i would retire
duke           retireso soon?
cas            what ho benito rupert
his lordships chambersshow his lordship to them
his lordship is unwell
enter benito
ben            this way, my lord
exit, followed by politian
duke           retire unwell
bal            so please you, sir i fear me
tis as you sayhis lordship is unwell
the damp air of the eveningthe fatigue
of a long journeytheindeed i had better
follow his lordship he must be unwell
i will return anon
duke           return anon
now this is very strange castiglione
this way, my son, i wish to speak with thee
you surely were mistaken in what you said
of the earl, mirthful, indeedwhich of us said
politian was a melancholy man?

o nothing earthly save the ray
thrown back from flowers of beautys eye,
as in those gardens where the day
springs from the gems of circassy
o nothing earthly save the thrill
of melody in woodland rill
or music of the passionhearted
joys voice so peacefully departed
that like the murmur in the shell,
its echo dwelleth and will dwell
o nothing of the dross of ours
yet all the beautyall the flowers
that list our love, and deck our bowers
adorn yon world afar, afar
the wandering star
twas a sweet time for nesacefor there
her world lay lolling on the golden air,
near four bright sunsa temporary rest
an oasis in desert of the blest
away awaymid seas of rays that roll
empyrean splendor oer th unchained soul
the soul that scarce the billows are so dense
can struggle to its destind eminence
to distant spheres, from time to time, she rode,
and late to ours, the favourd one of god
but, now, the ruler of an anchord realm,
she throws aside the sceptreleaves the helm,
and, amid incense and high spiritual hymns,
laves in quadruple light her angel limbs
now happiest, loveliest in yon lovely earth,
whence sprang the idea of beauty into birth,
falling in wreaths thro many a startled star,
like womans hair mid pearls, until, afar,
it lit on hills achaian, and there dwelt,
she lookd into infinityand knelt
rich clouds, for canopies, about her curled
fit emblems of the model of her world
seen but in beautynot impeding sight
of other beauty glittering thro the light
a wreath that twined each starry form around,
and all the opald air in color bound
all hurriedly she knelt upon a bed
of flowers of lilies such as reard the head
on the fair capo deucato , and sprang
so eagerly around about to hang
upon the flying footsteps ofdeep pride
of her who lovd a mortaland so died
the sephalica, budding with young bees,
upreard its purple stem around her knees
and gemmy flower, of trebizond misnamd
inmate of highest stars, where erst it shamd
all other loveliness its honied dew
the fabled nectar that the heathen knew
deliriously sweet, was droppd from heaven,
and fell on gardens of the unforgiven
in trebizondand on a sunny flower
so like its own above that, to this hour,
it still remaineth, torturing the bee
with madness, and unwonted reverie
in heaven, and all its environs, the leaf
and blossom of the fairy plant, in grief
disconsolate lingergrief that hangs her head,
repenting follies that full long have fled,
heaving her white breast to the balmy air,
like guilty beauty, chastend, and more fair
nyctanthes too, as sacred as the light
she fears to perfume, perfuming the night
and clytia  pondering between many a sun,
while pettish tears adown her petals run
and that aspiring flower that sprang on earth
and died, ere scarce exalted into birth,
bursting its odorous heart in spirit to wing
its way to heaven, from garden of a king
and valisnerian lotus thither flown
from struggling with the waters of the rhone
and thy most lovely purple perfume, zante
isola dorofior di levante
and the nelumbo bud that floats for ever
with indian cupid down the holy river
fair flowers, and fairy to whose care is given
to bear the goddess song, in odors, up to heaven
spirit that dwellest where,
in the deep sky,
the terrible and fair,
in beauty vie
beyond the line of blue
the boundary of the star
which turneth at the view
of thy barrier and thy bar
of the barrier overgone
by the comets who were cast
from their pride, and from their throne
to be drudges till the last
to be carriers of fire
the red fire of their heart
with speed that may not tire
and with pain that shall not part
who livestthat we know
in eternitywe feel
but the shadow of whose brow
what spirit shall reveal?
tho the beings whom thy nesace,
thy messenger hath known
have dreamd for thy infinity
a model of their own
thy will is done, o god
the star hath ridden high
thro many a tempest, but she rode
beneath thy burning eye
and here, in thought, to thee
in thought that can alone
ascend thy empire and so be
a partner of thy throne
by winged fantasy ,
my embassy is given,
till secrecy shall knowledge be
in the environs of heaven
she ceasdand buried then her burning cheek
abashd, amid the lilies there, to seek
a shelter from the fervor of his eye
for the stars trembled at the deity
she stirrd notbreathd notfor a voice was there
how solemnly pervading the calm air
a sound of silence on the startled ear
which dreamy poets name the music of the sphere
ours is a world of words quiet we call
silencewhich is the merest word of all
all nature speaks, and evn ideal things
flap shadowy sounds from the visionary wings
but ah not so when, thus, in realms on high
the eternal voice of god is passing by,
and the red winds are withering in the sky
what tho in worlds which sightless cycles run ,
linkd to a little system, and one sun
where all my love is folly, and the crowd
still think my terrors but the thunder cloud,
the storm, the earthquake, and the oceanwrath
ah will they cross me in my angrier path?
what tho in worlds which own a single sun
the sands of time grow dimmer as they run,
yet thine is my resplendency, so given
to bear my secrets thro the upper heaven
leave tenantless thy crystal home, and fly,
with all thy train, athwart the moony sky
apartlike fireflies in sicilian night ,
and wing to other worlds another light
divulge the secrets of thy embassy
to the proud orbs that twinkleand so be
to evry heart a barrier and a ban
lest the stars totter in the guilt of man
up rose the maiden in the yellow night,
the singlemooned eveon earth we plight
our faith to one loveand one moon adore
the birthplace of young beauty had no more
as sprang that yellow star from downy hours,
up rose the maiden from her shrine of flowers,
and bent oer sheeny mountain and dim plain
her waybut left not yet her therasan reign

high on a mountain of enamelld head
such as the drowsy shepherd on his bed
of giant pasturage lying at his ease,
raising his heavy eyelid, starts and sees
with many a mutterd hope to be forgiven
what time the moon is quadrated in heaven
of rosy head, that towering far away
into the sunlit ether, caught the ray
of sunken suns at eveat noon of night,
while the moon dancd with the fair stranger light
upreard upon such height arose a pile
of gorgeous columns on th uuburthend air,
flashing from parian marble that twin smile
far down upon the wave that sparkled there,
and nursled the young mountain in its lair
of molten stars their pavement, such as fall
thro the ebon air, besilvering the pall
of their own dissolution, while they die
adorning then the dwellings of the sky
a dome, by linked light from heaven let down,
sat gently on these columns as a crown
a window of one circular diamond, there,
lookd out above into the purple air
and rays from god shot down that meteor chain
and hallowd all the beauty twice again,
save when, between th empyrean and that ring,
some eager spirit flappd his dusky wing
but on the pillars seraph eyes have seen
the dimness of this world that grayish green
that nature loves the best for beautys grave
lurkd in each cornice, round each architrave
and every sculptured cherub thereabout
that from his marble dwelling peered out,
seemd earthly in the shadow of his niche
achaian statues in a world so rich?
friezes from tadmor and persepolis
from balbec, and the stilly, clear abyss
of beautiful gomorrah oh, the wave
is now upon theebut too late to save
sound loves to revel in a summer night
witness the murmur of the gray twilight
that stole upon the ear, in eyraco ,
of many a wild stargazer long ago
that stealeth ever on the ear of him
who, musing, gazeth on the distance dim,
and sees the darkness coming as a cloud
is not its formits voicemost palpable and loud?
but what is this?it comethand it brings
a music with ittis the rush of wings
a pauseand then a sweeping, falling strain,
and nesace is in her halls again
from the wild energy of wanton haste
her cheeks were flushing, and her lips apart
the zone that clung around her gentle waist
had burst beneath the heaving of her heart
within the centre of that hall to breathe
she pausd and panted, zanthe all beneath,
the fairy light that kissd her golden hair
and longd to rest, yet could but sparkle there
young flowers were whispering in melody
to happy flowers that nightand tree to tree
fountains were gushing music as they fell
in many a starlit grove, or moonlight dell
yet silence came upon material things
fair flowers, bright waterfalls and angel wings
and sound alone that from the spirit sprang
bore burthen to the charm the maiden sang
neath bluebell or streamer
or tufted wild spray
that keeps, from the dreamer,
the moonbeam away
bright beings that ponder,
with halfclosing eyes,
on the stars which your wonder
hath drawn from the skies,
till they glance thro the shade, and
come down to your brow
likeeyes of the maiden
who calls on you now
arise from your dreaming
in violet bowers,
to duty beseeming
these starlitten hours
and shake from your tresses
encumberd with dew
the breath of those kisses
that cumber them too
o how, without you, love
could angels be blest?
those kisses of true love
that lulld ye to rest
up shake from your wing
each hindering thing
the dew of the night
it would weigh down your flight
and true love caresses
o leave them apart
they are light on the tresses,
but lead on the heart

my beautiful one
whose harshest idea
will to melody run,

on the breezes to toss?
or, capriciously still,
like the lone albatross,
incumbent on night
as she on the air
to keep watch with delight
on the harmony there?
ligeia wherever
thy image may be,
no magic shall sever
thy music from thee
thou hast bound many eyes
in a dreamy sleep
but the strains still arise
which thy vigilance keep
the sound of the rain
which leaps down to the flower,
and dances again
in the rhythm of the shower
the murmur that springs
from the growing of grass
are the music of things
but are modelld, alas
away, then, my dearest,
o hie thee away
to springs that lie clearest
beneath the moonray
to lone lake that smiles,
in its dream of deep rest,
at the many starisles
that enjewel its breast
where wild flowers, creeping,
have mingled their shade,
on its margin is sleeping
full many a maid
some have left the cool glade, and
have slept with the bee
arouse them, my maiden,
on moorland and lea
go breathe on their slumber,
all softly in ear,
the musical number
they slumberd to hear
for what can awaken
an angel so soon
whose sleep hath been taken
beneath the cold moon,
as the spell which no slumber
of witchery may test,
the rhythmical number
which lulld him to rest?
spirits in wing, and angels to the view,
a thousand seraphs burst th empyrean thro,
young dreams still hovering on their drowsy flight
seraphs in all but knowledge, the keen light
that fell, refracted, thro thy bounds afar,
o death from eye of god upon that star
sweet was that errorsweeter still that death
sweet was that errorevn with us the breath
of science dims the mirror of our joy
to them twere the simoom, and would destroy
for what to them availeth it to know
that truth is falsehoodor that bliss is woe?
sweet was their deathwith them to die was rife
with the last ecstasy of satiate life
beyond that death no immortality
but sleep that pondereth and is not to be
and thereoh may my weary spirit dwell
apart from heavens eternityand yet how far from hell
what guilty spirit, in what shrubbery dim
heard not the stirring summons of that hymn?
but two they fell for heaven no grace imparts
to those who hear not for their beating hearts
a maidenangel and her seraphlover
o where and ye may seek the wide skies over
was love, the blind, near sober duty known?
unguided love hath fallenmid tears of perfect moan
he was a goodly spirithe who fell
a wanderer by mossymantled well
a gazer on the lights that shine above
a dreamer in the moonbeam by his love
what wonder? for each star is eyelike there,
and looks so sweetly down on beautys hair
and they, and evry mossy spring were holy
to his lovehaunted heart and melancholy
the night had found to him a night of wo

beetling it bends athwart the solemn sky,
and scowls on starry worlds that down beneath it lie
here sate he with his lovehis dark eye bent
with eagle gaze along the firmament

it trembled to the orb of earth again
ianthe, dearest, see how dim that ray
how lovely tis to look so far away
she seemed not thus upon that autumn eve
i left her gorgeous hallsnor mourned to leave,
that evethat evei should remember well
the sunray dropped, in lemnos with a spell
on th arabesque carving of a gilded hall
wherein i sate, and on the draperied wall
and on my eyelidso, the heavy light
how drowsily it weighed them into night
on flowers, before, and mist, and love they ran
with persian saadi in his gulistan
but o, that lighti slumbereddeath, the while,
stole oer my senses in that lovely isle
so softly that no single silken hair
awoke that sleptor knew that he was there
the last spot of earths orb i trod upon
was a proud temple called the parthenon
more beauty clung around her columned wall
then even thy glowing bosom beats withal,
and when old time my wing did disenthral
thence sprang ias the eagle from his tower,
and years i left behind me in an hour
what time upon her airy bounds i hung,
one half the garden of her globe was flung
unrolling as a chart unto my view
tenantless cities of the desert too
ianthe, beauty crowded on me then,
and half i wished to be again of men
my angelo and why of them to be?
a brighter dwellingplace is here for thee
and greener fields than in yon world above,
and womans lovelinessand passionate love
but list, ianthe when the air so soft
failed, as my pennoned spirit leapt aloft,
perhaps my brain grew dizzybut the world
i left so late was into chaos hurled,
sprang from her station, on the winds apart,
and rolled a flame, the fiery heaven athwart
methought, my sweet one, then i ceased to soar,
and fellnot swiftly as i rose before,
but with a downward, tremulous motion thro
light, brazen rays, this golden star unto
nor long the measure of my falling hours,
for nearest of all stars was thine to ours
dread star that came, amid a night of mirth,
a red daedalion on the timid earth
we cameand to thy earthbut not to us
be given our ladys bidding to discuss
we came, my love around, above, below,
gay firefly of the night we come and go,
nor ask a reason save the angelnod
she grants to us as granted by her god
but, angelo, than thine gray time unfurled
never his fairy wing oer fairer world
dim was its little disk, and angel eyes
alone could see the phantom in the skies,
when first al aaraaf knew her course to be
headlong thitherward oer the starry sea
but when its glory swelled upon the sky,
as glowing beautys bust beneath mans eye,
we paused before the heritage of men,
and thy star trembledas doth beauty then
thus in discourse, the lovers whiled away
the night that waned and waned and brought no day
they fell for heaven to them no hope imparts
who hear not for the beating of their hearts

kind solace in a dying hour
such, father, is not now my theme
i will not madly deem that power
of earth may shrive me of the sin
unearthly pride hath revelled in
i have no time to dote or dream
you call it hopethat fire of fire
it is but agony of desire
if i can hopeo god i can
its fount is holiermore divine
i would not call thee fool, old man,
but such is not a gift of thine
know thou the secret of a spirit
bowed from its wild pride into shame
o yearning heart i did inherit
thy withering portion with the fame,
the searing glory which hath shone
amid the jewels of my throne,
halo of hell and with a pain
not hell shall make me fear again
o craving heart, for the lost flowers
and sunshine of my summer hours
the undying voice of that dead time,
with its interminable chime,
rings, in the spirit of a spell,
upon thy emptinessa knell
i have not always been as now
the fevered diadem on my brow
i claimed and won usurpingly
hath not the same fierce heirdom given
rome to the csarthis to me?
the heritage of a kingly mind,
and a proud spirit which hath striven
triumphantly with human kind
on mountain soil i first drew life
the mists of the taglay have shed
nightly their dews upon my head,
and, i believe, the winged strife
and tumult of the headlong air
have nestled in my very hair
so late from heaventhat dewit fell
mid dreams of an unholy night
upon me with the touch of hell,
while the red flashing of the light
from clouds that hung, like banners, oer,
appeared to my halfclosing eye
the pageantry of monarchy
and the deep trumpetthunders roar
came hurriedly upon me, telling
of human battle, where my voice,
my own voice, silly childwas swelling
o how my spirit would rejoice,
and leap within me at the cry
the battlecry of victory
the rain came down upon my head
unshelteredand the heavy wind
rendered me mad and deaf and blind
it was but man, i thought, who shed
laurels upon me and the rush
the torrent of the chilly air
gurgled within my ear the crush
of empireswith the captives prayer
the hum of suitorsand the tone
of flattery round a sovereigns throne
my passions, from that hapless hour,
usurped a tyranny which men
have deemed since i have reached to power,
my innate naturebe it so
but, father, there lived one who, then,
thenin my boyhoodwhen their fire
burned with a still intenser glow
for passion must, with youth, expire
een then who knew this iron heart
in womans weakness had a part
i have no wordsalasto tell
the loveliness of loving well
nor would i now attempt to trace
the more than beauty of a face
whose lineaments, upon my mind,
areshadows on th unstable wind
thus i remember having dwelt
some page of early lore upon,
with loitering eye, till i have felt
the letterswith their meaningmelt
to fantasieswith none
o, she was worthy of all love
love as in infancy was mine
twas such as angel minds above
might envy her young heart the shrine
on which my every hope and thought
were incensethen a goodly gift,
for they were childish and upright
pureas her young example taught
why did i leave it, and, adrift,
trust to the fire within, for light?
we grew in ageand lovetogether
roaming the forest, and the wild
my breast her shield in wintry weather
and, when the friendly sunshine smiled
and she would mark the opening skies,
i saw no heavenbut in her eyes
young loves first lesson isthe heart
for mid that sunshine, and those smiles,
when, from our little cares apart,
and laughing at her girlish wiles,
id throw me on her throbbing breast,
and pour my spirit out in tears
there was no need to speak the rest
no need to quiet any fears
of herwho asked no reason why,
but turned on me her quiet eye
yet more than worthy of the love
my spirit struggled with, and strove
when, on the mountain peak, alone,
ambition lent it a new tone
i had no beingbut in thee
the world, and all it did contain
in the earththe airthe sea
its joyits little lot of pain
that was new pleasurethe ideal,
dim, vanities of dreams by night
and dimmer nothings which were real
shadowsand a more shadowy light
parted upon their misty wings,
and, so, confusedly, became
thine image anda namea name
two separateyet most intimate things
i was ambitioushave you known
the passion, father? you have not
a cottager, i marked a throne
of half the world as all my own,
and murmured at such lowly lot
but, just like any other dream,
upon the vapor of the dew
my own had past, did not the beam
of beauty which did while it thro
the minutethe hourthe dayoppress
my mind with double loveliness
we walked together on the crown
of a high mountain which looked down
afar from its proud natural towers
of rock and forest, on the hills
the dwindled hills begirt with bowers
and shouting with a thousand rills
i spoke to her of power and pride,
but mysticallyin such guise
that she might deem it nought beside
the moments converse in her eyes
i read, perhaps too carelessly
a mingled feeling with my own
the flush on her bright cheek, to me
seemed to become a queenly throne
too well that i should let it be
light in the wilderness alone
i wrapped myself in grandeur then,
and donned a visionary crown
yet it was not that fantasy
had thrown her mantle over me
but that, among the rabblemen,
lion ambition is chained down
and crouches to a keepers hand
not so in deserts where the grand
the wildthe terrible conspire
with their own breath to fan his fire
look round thee now on samarcand
is she not queen of earth? her pride
above all cities? in her hand
their destinies? in all beside
of glory which the world hath known
stands she not nobly and alone?
fallingher veriest steppingstone
shall form the pedestal of a throne
and who her sovereign? timourhe
whom the astonished people saw
striding oer empires haughtily
a diademed outlaw
o, human love thou spirit given,
on earth, of all we hope in heaven
which fallst into the soul like rain
upon the sirocwithered plain,
and, failing in thy power to bless,
but leavst the heart a wilderness
idea which bindest life around
with music of so strange a sound
and beauty of so wild a birth
farewell for i have won the earth
when hope, the eagle that towered, could see
no cliff beyond him in the sky,
his pinions were bent droopingly
and homeward turned his softened eye
twas sunset when the sun will part
there comes a sullenness of heart
to him who still would look upon
the glory of the summer sun
that soul will hate the evning mist
so often lovely, and will list
to the sound of the coming darkness known
to those whose spirits hearken as one
who, in a dream of night, would fly,
but cannot, from a danger nigh
what tho the moontho the white moon
shed all the splendor of her noon,
her smile is chillyand her beam,
in that time of dreariness, will seem
so like you gather in your breath
a portrait taken after death
and boyhood is a summer sun
whose waning is the dreariest one
for all we live to know is known,
and all we seek to keep hath flown
let life, then, as the dayflower, fall
with the noonday beautywhich is all
i reached my homemy home no more
for all had flown who made it so
i passed from out its mossy door,
and, tho my tread was soft and low,
a voice came from the threshold stone
of one whom i had earlier known
o, i defy thee, hell, to show
on beds of fire that burn below,
an humbler hearta deeper woe
father, i firmly do believe
i knowfor death who comes for me
from regions of the blest afar,
where there is nothing to deceive,
hath left his iron gate ajar
and rays of truth you cannot see
are flashing thro eternity
i do believe that eblis hath
a snare in every human path
else how, when in the holy grove
i wandered of the idol, love,
who daily scents his snowy wings
with incense of burntofferings
from the most unpolluted things,
whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven
above with trellised rays from heaven
no mote may shunno tiniest fly
the lightning of his eagle eye
how was it that ambition crept,
unseen, amid the revels there,
till growing bold, he laughed and leapt
in the tangles of loves very hair


to helen
helen, thy beauty is to me
like those nicean barks of yore,
that gently, oer a perfumed sea,
the weary, wayworn wanderer bore
to his own native shore
on desperate seas long wont to roam,

thy naiad airs have brought me home
to the glory that was greece,
to the grandeur that was rome

the valley of unrest
once it smiled a silent dell
where the people did not dwell
they had gone unto the wars,
trusting to the mildeyed stars,
nightly, from their azure towers,
to keep watch above the flowers,
in the midst of which all day
the red sunlight lazily lay,
now each visitor shall confess
the sad valleys restlessness
nothing there is motionless
nothing save the airs that brood
over the magic solitude
ah, by no wind are stirred those trees
that palpitate like the chill seas
around the misty hebrides
ah, by no wind those clouds are driven
that rustle through the unquiet heaven
unceasingly, from morn till even,
over the violets there that lie
in myriad types of the human eye
over the lilies that wave
and weep above a nameless grave
they wavefrom out their fragrant tops
eternal dews come down in drops
they weepfrom off their delicate stems
perennial tears descend in gems

ceasing their hymns, attend the spell

tottering above

the enamoured moon
blushes with love,
while, to listen, the red levin
with the rapid pleiads, even,
which were seven,
pauses in heaven
and they say the starry choir
and the other listening things
that israfelis fire
is owing to that lyre
by which he sits and sings
the trembling living wire
of those unusual strings

where deep thoughts are a duty
where loves a growup god
where the houri glances are
imbued with all the beauty
which we worship in a star
therefore, thou art not wrong,
israfeli, who despisest
an unimpassioned song
to thee the laurels belong,
best bard, because the wisest
merrily live and long
the ecstasies above
with thy burning measures suit
thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love,
with the fervor of thy lute
well may the stars be mute
yes, heaven is thine but this
is a world of sweets and sours
our flowers are merelyflowers,
and the shadow of thy perfect bliss
is the sunshine of ours

the spirits of the dead who stood
in life before thee are again
in death around theeand their will
shall overshadow thee be still
the nighttho clearshall frown
and the stars shall not look down
from their high thrones in the heaven,
with light like hope to mortals given
but their red orbs, without beam,
to thy weariness shall seem
as a burning and a fever
which would cling to thee forever
now are thoughts thou shalt not banish
now are visions neer to vanish
from thy spirit shall they pass
no morelike dewdrops from the grass
the breezethe breath of godis still
and the mist upon the hill
shadowyshadowyyet unbroken,
is a symbol and a token
how it hangs upon the trees,
a mystery of mysteries


a dream
in visions of the dark night
i have dreamed of joy departed
but a waking dream of life and light
hath left me brokenhearted
ah what is not a dream by day
to him whose eyes are cast
on things around him with a ray
turned back upon the past?
that holy dreamthat holy dream,
while all the world were chiding,
hath cheered me as a lovely beam,
a lonely spirit guiding
what though that light, thro storm and night,
so trembled from afar
what could there be more purely bright
in truths day star?


romance
romance, who loves to nod and sing,
with drowsy head and folded wing,
among the green leaves as they shake
far down within some shadowy lake,
to me a painted paroquet
hath beena most familiar bird
taught me my alphabet to say
to lisp my very earliest word
while in the wild wood i did lie,
a childwith a most knowing eye
of late, eternal condor years
so shake the very heaven on high
with tumult as they thunder by,
i have no time for idle cares
though gazing on the unquiet sky
and when an hour with calmer wings
its down upon my spirit flings
that little time with lyre and rhyme
to while awayforbidden things
my heart would feel to be a crime
unless it trembled with the strings


fairyland
dim valesand shadowy floods
and cloudylooking woods,
whose forms we cant discover
for the tears that drip all over
huge moons there wax and wane
againagainagain
every moment of the night
forever changing places
and they put out the starlight
with the breath from their pale faces
about twelve by the moondial
one more filmy than the rest
a kind which, upon trial,
they have found to be the best
comes downstill downand down
with its centre on the crown
of a mountains eminence,
while its wide circumference
in easy drapery falls
over hamlets, over halls,
wherever they may be
oer the strange woodsoer the sea
over spirits on the wing
over every drowsy thing
and buries them up quite
in a labyrinth of light
and then, how deepo, deep
is the passion of their sleep
in the morning they arise,
and their moony covering
is soaring in the skies,
with the tempests as they toss,
likealmost any thing
or a yellow albatross
they use that moon no more
for the same end as before
videlicet a tent
which i think extravagant
its atomies, however,
into a shower dissever,
of which those butterflies,
of earth, who seek the skies,
and so come down again
nevercontented thing
have brought a specimen
upon their quivering wings


the lake
in spring of youth it was my lot
to haunt of the wide world a spot
the which i could not love the less
so lovely was the loneliness
of a wild lake, with black rock bound,
and the tall pines that towered around
but when the night had thrown her pall
upon the spot, as upon all,
and the mystic wind went by
murmuring in melody
thenah, then, i would awake
to the terror of the lone lake
yet that terror was not fright,
but a tremulous delight
a feeling not the jewelled mine
could teach or bribe me to define
nor lovealthough the love were thine
death was in that poisonous wave,
and in its gulf a fitting grave
for him who thence could solace bring
to his lone imagining
whose solitary soul could make
an eden of that dim lake


evening star
twas noontide of summer,
and midtime of night,
and stars, in their orbits,
shone pale, through the light
of the brighter, cold moon
mid planets her slaves,
herself in the heavens,
her beam on the waves
i gazed awhile
on her cold smile
too coldtoo cold for me
there passed, as a shroud,
a fleecy cloud,
and i turned away to thee,
proud evening star,
in thy glory afar
and dearer thy beam shall be
for joy to my heart
is the proud part
thou bearest in heaven at night,
and more i admire
thy distant fire,
than that colder, lowly light


imitation
a dark unfathomed tide
of interminable pride
a mystery, and a dream,
should my early life seem
i say that dream was fraught
with a wild and waking thought
of beings that have been,
which my spirit hath not seen,
had i let them pass me by,
with a dreaming eye
let none of earth inherit
that vision on my spirit
those thoughts i would control,
as a spell upon his soul
for that bright hope at last
and that light time have past,
and my wordly rest hath gone
with a sigh as it passed on
i care not though it perish
with a thought i then did cherish


the happiest day
i       the happiest daythe happiest hour
my seared and blighted heart hath known,
the highest hope of pride and power,
i feel hath flown
ii      of power said i? yes such i ween
but they have vanished long, alas
the visions of my youth have been
but let them pass
iii     and pride, what have i now with thee?
another brow may evn inherit
the venom thou hast poured on me
be still my spirit
iv      the happiest daythe happiest hour
mine eyes shall seehave ever seen
the brightest glance of pride and power
i feel have been
v       but were that hope of pride and power
now offered with the pain
evn then i feltthat brightest hour
i would not live again
vi      for on its wing was dark alloy
and as it flutteredfell
an essencepowerful to destroy
a soul that knew it well


translation from the greek
hymn to aristogeiton and harmodius
i      wreathed in myrtle, my sword ill conceal,
like those champions devoted and brave,
when they plunged in the tyrant their steel,
and to athens deliverance gave
ii     beloved heroes your deathless souls roam
in the joy breathing isles of the blest
where the mighty of old have their home
where achilles and diomed rest
iii    in fresh myrtle my blade ill entwine,
like harmodius, the gallant and good,
when he made at the tutelar shrine
a libation of tyrannys blood
iv     ye deliverers of athens from shame
ye avengers of libertys wrongs
endless ages shall cherish your fame,
embalmed in their echoing songs

notes
on the poems written in youth little comment is needed this
section includes the pieces printed for the first volume of  which
was subsequently suppressed, such poems from the first and second
published volumes of  and  as have not already been given in
their revised versions, and a few others collected from various sources
al aaraaf first appeared, with the sonnet to silence prefixed to it,
in , and is, substantially, as originally issued in the edition for
, however, this poem, its authors longest, was introduced by the
following twentynine lines, which have been omitted in all subsequent
collections
al aaraaf
mysterious star
thou wert my dream
all a long summer night
be now my theme
by this clear stream,
of thee will i write
meantime from afar
bathe me in light
thy world has not the dross of ours,
yet all the beautyall the flowers
that list our love or deck our bowers
in dreamy gardens, where do lie
dreamy maidens all the day
while the silver winds of circassy
on violet couches faint away
littleoh little dwells in thee
like unto what on earth we see
beautys eye is here the bluest
in the falsest and untruest
on the sweetest air doth float
the most sad and solemn note
if with thee be broken hearts,
joy so peacefully departs,
that its echo still doth dwell,
like the murmur in the shell
thou thy truest type of grief
is the gently falling leaf
thou thy framing is so holy
sorrow is not melancholy

the earliest version of tamerlane was included in the suppressed
volume of , but differs very considerably from the poem as now
published the present draft, besides innumerable verbal alterations and
improvements upon the original, is more carefully punctuated, and, the
lines being indented, presents a more pleasing appearance, to the eye at
least

to helen first appeared in the  volume, as did also the
valley of unrest as the valley nis, israfel, and one or two
others of the youthful pieces
the poem styled romance constituted the preface of the  volume,
but with the addition of the following lines
succeeding years, too wild for song,
then rolled like tropic storms along,
where, though the garish lights that fly
dying along the troubled sky,
lay bare, through vistas thunderriven,
the blackness of the general heaven,
that very blackness yet doth fling
light on the lightnings silver wing
for being an idle boy lang syne,
who read anacreon and drank wine,
i early found anacreon rhymes
were almost passionate sometimes
and by strange alchemy of brain
his pleasures always turned to pain
his navet to wild desire
his wit to lovehis wine to fire
and so, being young and dipt in folly,
i fell in love with melancholy
and used to throw my earthly rest
and quiet all away in jest
i could not love except where death
was mingling his with beautys breath
or hymen, time, and destiny,
were stalking between her and me

but now my soul hath too much room
gone are the glory and the gloom
the black hath mellowd into gray,
and all the fires are fading away
my draught of passion hath been deep
i revelld, and i now would sleep
and after drunkenness of soul
succeeds the glories of the bowl
an idle longing night and day
to dream my very life away
but dreamsof those who dream as i,
aspiringly, are damned, and die
yet should i swear i mean alone,
by notes so very shrilly blown,
to break upon times monotone,
while yet my vapid joy and grief
are tintless of the yellow leaf
why not an imp the greybeard hath,
will shake his shadow in my path
and een the greybeard will oerlook
connivingly my dreamingbook

doubtful poems

alone
from childhoods hour i have not been
as others werei have not seen
as others sawi could not bring
my passions from a common spring
from the same source i have not taken
my sorrowi could not awaken
my heart to joy at the same tone
and all i lovedi loved alone
thouin my childhoodin the dawn
of a most stormy lifewas drawn
from every depth of good and ill
the mystery which binds me still
from the torrent, or the fountain
from the red cliff of the mountain
from the sun that round me rolld
in its autumn tint of gold
from the lightning in the sky
as it passed me flying by
from the thunder and the storm
and the cloud that took the form
when the rest of heaven was blue
of a demon in my view
march ,

to isadore
i       beneath the vineclad eaves,
whose shadows fall before
thy lowly cottage door
under the lilacs tremulous leaves
within thy snowy clasped hand
the purple flowers it bore
last eve in dreams, i saw thee stand,
like queenly nymph from fairyland
enchantress of the flowery wand,
most beauteous isadore
ii      and when i bade the dream
upon thy spirit flee,
thy violet eyes to me
upturned, did overflowing seem
with the deep, untold delight
of loves serenity
thy classic brow, like lilies white
and pale as the imperial night
upon her throne, with stars bedight,
enthralled my soul to thee
iii     ah ever i behold
thy dreamy, passionate eyes,
blue as the languid skies
hung with the sunsets fringe of gold
now strangely clear thine image grows,
and olden memories
are startled from their long repose
like shadows on the silent snows
when suddenly the nightwind blows
where quiet moonlight lies
iv      like music heard in dreams,
like strains of harps unknown,
of birds for ever flown,
audible as the voice of streams
that murmur in some leafy dell,
i hear thy gentlest tone,
and silence cometh with her spell
like that which on my tongue doth dwell,
when tremulous in dreams i tell
my love to thee alone
v       in every valley heard,
floating from tree to tree,
less beautiful to me,
the music of the radiant bird,
than artless accents such as thine
whose echoes never flee
ah how for thy sweet voice i pine
for uttered in thy tones benign
enchantress this rude name of mine
doth seem a melody

the village street
in these rapid, restless shadows,
once i walked at eventide,
when a gentle, silent maiden,
walked in beauty at my side
she alone there walked beside me
all in beauty, like a bride
pallidly the moon was shining
on the dewy meadows nigh
on the silvery, silent rivers,
on the mountains far and high,
on the oceans starlit waters,
where the winds aweary die
slowly, silently we wandered
from the open cottage door,
underneath the elms long branches
to the pavement bending oer
underneath the mossy willow
and the dying sycamore
with the myriad stars in beauty
all bedight, the heavens were seen,
radiant hopes were bright around me,
like the light of stars serene
like the mellow midnight splendor
of the nights irradiate queen
audibly the elmleaves whispered
peaceful, pleasant melodies,
like the distant murmured music
of unquiet, lovely seas
while the winds were hushed in slumber
in the fragrant flowers and trees
wondrous and unwonted beauty
still adorning all did seem,
while i told my love in fables
neath the willows by the stream
would the heart have kept unspoken
love that was its rarest dream
instantly away we wandered
in the shadowy twilight tide,
she, the silent, scornful maiden,
walking calmly at my side,
with a step serene and stately,
all in beauty, all in pride
vacantly i walked beside her
on the earth mine eyes were cast
swift and keen there came unto me
bitter memories of the past
on me, like the rain in autumn
on the dead leaves, cold and fast
underneath the elms we parted,
by the lowly cottage door
one brief word alone was uttered
never on our lips before
and away i walked forlornly,
brokenhearted evermore
slowly, silently i loitered,
homeward, in the night, alone
sudden anguish bound my spirit,
that my youth had never known
wild unrest, like that which cometh
when the nights first dream hath flown
now, to me the elmleaves whisper
mad, discordant melodies,
and keen melodies like shadows
haunt the moaning willow trees,
and the sycamores with laughter
mock me in the nightly breeze
sad and pale the autumn moonlight
through the sighing foliage streams
and each morning, midnight shadow,
shadow of my sorrow seems
strive, o heart, forget thine idol
and, o soul, forget thy dreams

the forest reverie
tis said that when
the hands of men
tamed this primeval wood,
and hoary trees with groans of wo,
like warriors by an unknown foe,
were in their strength subdued,
the virgin earth
gave instant birth
to springs that neer did flow
that in the sun
did rivulets run,
and all around rare flowers did blow
the wild rose pale
perfumed the gale,
and the queenly lily adown the dale
whom the sun and the dew
and the winds did woo,
with the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew
so when in tears
the love of years
is wasted like the snow,
and the fine fibrils of its life
by the rude wrong of instant strife
are broken at a blow
within the heart
do springs upstart
of which it doth now know,
and strange, sweet dreams,
like silent streams
that from new fountains overflow,
with the earlier tide
of rivers glide
deep in the heart whose hope has died
quenching the fires its ashes hide,
its ashes, whence will spring and grow
sweet flowers, ere long,
the rare and radiant flowers of song

notes
of the many verses from time to time ascribed to the pen of edgar poe,
and not included among his known writings, the lines entitled alone
have the chief claim to our notice facsimile copies of this piece
had been in possession of the present editor some time previous to its
publication in scribners magazine for september  but as proofs
of the authorship claimed for it were not forthcoming, he refrained from
publishing it as requested the desired proofs have not yet been
adduced, and there is, at present, nothing but internal evidence to
guide us alone is stated to have been written by poe in the album of
a baltimore lady mrs balderstone?, on march th, , and the
facsimile given in scribners is alleged to be of his handwriting
if the caligraphy be poes, it is different in all essential respects
from all the many specimens known to us, and strongly resembles that of
the writer of the heading and dating of the manuscript, both of which
the contributor of the poem acknowledges to have been recently added
the lines, however, if not by poe, are the most successful imitation of
his early mannerisms yet made public, and, in the opinion of one well
qualified to speak, are not unworthy on the whole of the parentage
claimed for them
whilst edgar poe was editor of the broadway journal, some lines to
isadore appeared therein, and, like several of his known pieces, bore
no signature they were at once ascribed to poe, and in order to satisfy
questioners, an editorial paragraph subsequently appeared, saying they
were by a ide, junior two previous poems had appeared in the
broadway journal over the signature of a m ide, and whoever wrote
them was also the author of the lines to isadore in order, doubtless,
to give a show of variety, poe was then publishing some of his known
works in his journal over noms de plume, and as no other writings
whatever can be traced to any person bearing the name of a m ide, it
is not impossible that the poems now republished in this collection may
be by the author of the raven having been published without his usual
elaborate revision, poe may have wished to hide his hasty work under an
assumed name the three pieces are included in the present collection,
so the reader can judge for himself what pretensions they possess to be
by the author of the raven

prose poems

the island of the fay
nullus enim locus sine genio est
servius
la musique, says marmontel, in those contes moraux which in all
our translations we have insisted upon calling moral tales, as if in
mockery of their spiritla musique est le seul des talens qui jouisse
de luimeme tous les autres veulent des temoins he here confounds
the pleasure derivable from sweet sounds with the capacity for creating
them no more than any other talent, is that for music susceptible of
complete enjoyment where there is no second party to appreciate its
exercise and it is only in common with other talents that it produces
effects which may be fully enjoyed in solitude the idea which the
raconteur has either failed to entertain clearly, or has sacrificed in
its expression to his national love of point, is doubtless the very
tenable one that the higher order of music is the most thoroughly
estimated when we are exclusively alone the proposition in this form
will be admitted at once by those who love the lyre for its own sake and
for its spiritual uses but there is one pleasure still within the reach
of fallen mortality, and perhaps only one, which owes even more than
does music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion i mean the happiness
experienced in the contemplation of natural scenery in truth, the man
who would behold aright the glory of god upon earth must in solitude
behold that glory to me at least the presence, not of human life only,
but of life, in any other form than that of the green things which grow
upon the soil and are voiceless, is a stain upon the landscape, is at
war with the genius of the scene i love, indeed, to regard the dark
valleys, and the gray rocks, and the waters that silently smile, and the
forests that sigh in uneasy slumbers, and the proud watchful mountains
that look down upon all,i love to regard these as themselves but the
colossal members of one vast animate and sentient wholea whole whose
form that of the sphere is the most perfect and most inclusive of all
whose path is among associate planets whose meek handmaiden is the
moon whose mediate sovereign is the sun whose life is eternity whose
thought is that of a god whose enjoyment is knowledge whose destinies
are lost in immensity whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our
own cognizance of the animalcul which infest the brain, a being which
we in consequence regard as purely inanimate and material, much in the
same manner as these animalcul must thus regard us
our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on every
hand, notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the priesthood,
that space, and therefore that bulk, is an important consideration in
the eyes of the almighty the cycles in which the stars move are those
best adapted for the evolution, without collision, of the greatest
possible number of bodies the forms of those bodies are accurately such
as within a given surface to include the greatest possible amount of
matter while the surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodate
a denser population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces
otherwise arranged nor is it any argument against bulk being an object
with god that space itself is infinite for there may be an infinity of
matter to fill it and since we see clearly that the endowment of matter
with vitality is a principleindeed, as far as our judgments extend,
the leading principle in the operations of deity, it is scarcely
logical to imagine it confined to the regions of the minute, where we
daily trace it, and not extending to those of the august as we find
cycle within cycle without end, yet all revolving around one fardistant
centre which is the godhead, may we not analogically suppose, in the
same manner, life within life, the less within the greater, and all
within the spirit divine? in short, we are madly erring through
selfesteem in believing man, in either his temporal or future
destinies, to be of more moment in the universe than that vast clod of
the valley which he tills and contemns, and to which he denies a soul,
for no more profound reason than that he does not behold it in operation

these fancies, and such as these, have always given to my meditations
among the mountains and the forests, by the rivers and the ocean, a
tinge of what the everyday world would not fail to term the fantastic
my wanderings amid such scenes have been many and farsearching, and
often solitary and the interest with which i have strayed through many
a dim deep valley, or gazed into the reflected heaven of many a bright
lake, has been an interest greatly deepened by the thought that i have
strayed and gazed alone what flippant frenchman  was it who said,
in allusion to the well known work of zimmermann, that la solitude est
une belle chose mais il faut quelquun pour vous dire que la solitude
est une belle chose? the epigram cannot be gainsaid but the necessity
is a thing that does not exist
it was during one of my lonely journeyings, amid a far distant region of
mountain locked within mountain, and sad rivers and melancholy tarns
writhing or sleeping within all, that i chanced upon a certain rivulet
and island i came upon them suddenly in the leafy june, and threw
myself upon the turf beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub,
that i might doze as i contemplated the scene i felt that thus only
should i look upon it, such was the character of phantasm which it wore
on all sides, save to the west where the sun was about sinking, arose
the verdant walls of the forest the little river which turned sharply
in its course, and was thus immediately lost to sight, seemed to have no
exit from its prison, but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage of
the trees to the east while in the opposite quarter so it appeared to
me as i lay at length and glanced upward there poured down noiselessly
and continuously into the valley a rich golden and crimson waterfall
from the sunset fountains of the sky
about midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in, one
small circular island, profusely verdured, reposed upon the bosom of the
stream
so blended bank and shadow there,
that each seemed pendulous in air
so mirrorlike was the glassy water, that it was scarcely possible to
say at what point upon the slope of the emerald turf its crystal
dominion began my position enabled me to include in a single view both
the eastern and western extremities of the islet, and i observed a
singularlymarked difference in their aspects the latter was all one
radiant harem of garden beauties it glowed and blushed beneath the eye
of the slant sunlight, and fairly laughed with flowers the grass was
short, springy, sweetscented, and asphodelinterspersed the trees were
lithe, mirthful, erect, bright, slender, and graceful, of eastern figure
and foliage, with bark smooth, glossy, and particolored there seemed a
deep sense of life and joy about all, and although no airs blew from out
the heavens, yet everything had motion through the gentle sweepings to
and fro of innumerable butterflies, that might have been mistaken for
tulips with wings
the other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest shade
a sombre, yet beautiful and peaceful gloom, here pervaded all things
the trees were dark in color and mournful in form and attitude
wreathing themselves into sad, solemn, and spectral shapes, that
conveyed ideas of mortal sorrow and untimely death the grass wore the
deep tint of the cypress, and the heads of its blades hung droopingly,
and hither and thither among it were many small unsightly hillocks, low
and narrow, and not very long, that had the aspect of graves, but were
not, although over and all about them the rue and the rosemary
clambered the shades of the trees fell heavily upon the water, and
seemed to bury itself therein, impregnating the depths of the element
with darkness i fancied that each shadow, as the sun descended lower
and lower, separated itself sullenly from the trunk that gave it birth,
and thus became absorbed by the stream, while other shadows issued
momently from the trees, taking the place of their predecessors thus
entombed
this idea having once seized upon my fancy greatly excited it, and i
lost myself forthwith in reverie if ever island were enchanted, said
i to myself, this is it this is the haunt of the few gentle fays who
remain from the wreck of the race are these green tombs theirs?or do
they yield up their sweet lives as mankind yield up their own? in dying,
do they not rather waste away mournfully, rendering unto god little by
little their existence, as these trees render up shadow after shadow,
exhausting their substance unto dissolution? what the wasting tree is to
the water that imbibes its shade, growing thus blacker by what it preys
upon, may not the life of the fay be to the death which engulfs it?
as i thus mused, with halfshut eyes, while the sun sank rapidly to
rest, and eddying currents careered round and round the island, bearing
upon their bosom large dazzling white flakes of the bark of the
sycamore, flakes which, in their multiform positions upon the water, a
quick imagination might have converted into anything it pleased while i
thus mused, it appeared to me that the form of one of those very fays
about whom i had been pondering, made its way slowly into the darkness
from out the light at the western end of the island she stood erect in
a singularly fragile canoe, and urged it with the mere phantom of an
oar while within the influence of the lingering sunbeams, her attitude
seemed indicative of joy, but sorrow deformed it as she passed within
the shade slowly she glided along, and at length rounded the islet and
reentered the region of light the revolution which has just been made
by the fay, continued i musingly, is the cycle of the brief year of
her life she has floated through her winter and through her summer she
is a year nearer unto death for i did not fail to see that as she came
into the shade, her shadow fell from her, and was swallowed up in the
dark water, making its blackness more black
and again the boat appeared and the fay, but about the attitude of the
latter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic joy
she floated again from out the light and into the gloom which deepened
momently, and again her shadow fell from her into the ebony water, and
became absorbed into its blackness and again and again she made the
circuit of the island while the sun rushed down to his slumbers, and
at each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person,
while it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct, and at each
passage into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade, which became
whelmed in a shadow more black but at length, when the sun had utterly
departed, the fay, now the mere ghost of her former self, went
disconsolately with her boat into the region of the ebony flood, and
that she issued thence at all i cannot say, for darkness fell over all
things, and i beheld her magical figure no more

the power of words
oinos
pardon, agathos, the weakness of a spirit newfledged with
immortality
agathos
you have spoken nothing, my oinos, for which pardon is to be demanded
not even here is knowledge a thing of intuition for wisdom, ask of
the angels freely, that it may be given
oinos
but in this existence i dreamed that i should be at once cognizant of
all things, and thus at once happy in being cognizant of all
agathos
ah, not in knowledge is happiness, but in the acquisition of
knowledge in forever knowing, we are forever blessed but to know
all, were the curse of a fiend
oinos
but does not the most high know all?
agathos
that since he is the most happy must be still the one thing
unknown even to him
oinos
but, since we grow hourly in knowledge, must not at last all things
be known?
agathos
look down into the abysmal distancesattempt to force the gaze down
the multitudinous vistas of the stars, as we sweep slowly through them
thusand thusand thus even the spiritual vision, is it not at all
points arrested by the continuous golden walls of the universe?the
walls of the myriads of the shining bodies that mere number has
appeared to blend into unity?
oinos
i clearly perceive that the infinity of matter is no dream
agathos
there are no dreams in aidennbut it is here whispered that, of this
infinity of matter, the sole purpose is to afford infinite springs
at which the soul may allay the thirst to know which is forever
unquenchable within itsince to quench it would be to extinguish the
souls self question me then, my oinos, freely and without fear
come we will leave to the left the loud harmony of the pleiades, and
swoop outward from the throne into the starry meadows beyond orion,
where, for pansies and violets, and heartsease, are the beds of the
triplicate and tripletinted suns
oinos
and now, agathos, as we proceed, instruct mespeak to me in the
earths familiar tones i understand not what you hinted to me just
now of the modes or of the methods of what during mortality, we were
accustomed to call creation do you mean to say that the creator is
not god?
agathos
i mean to say that the deity does not create
oinos
explain
agathos
in the beginning only, he created the seeming creatures which are now
throughout the universe so perpetually springing into being can only
be considered as the mediate or indirect, not as the direct or
immediate results of the divine creative power
oinos
among men, my agathos, this idea would be considered heretical in the
extreme
agathos
among the angels, my oinos, it is seen to be simply true
oinos
i can comprehend you thus farthat certain operations of what we term
nature, or the natural laws, will, under certain conditions, give rise
to that which has all the appearance of creation shortly before the
final overthrow of the earth, there were, i well remember, many very
successful experiments in what some philosophers were weak enough to
denominate the creation of animalcul
agathos
the cases of which you speak were, in fact, instances of the secondary
creation, and of the only species of creation which has ever been
since the first word spoke into existence the first law
oinos
are not the starry worlds that, from the abyss of nonentity, burst
hourly forth into the heavensare not these stars, agathos, the
immediate handiwork of the king?
agathos
let me endeavor, my oinos, to lead you, step by step, to the
conception i intend you are well aware that, as no thought can
perish, so no act is without infinite result we moved our hands, for
example, when we were dwellers on the earth, and in so doing we gave
vibration to the atmosphere which engirdled it this vibration was
indefinitely extended till it gave impulse to every particle of the
earths air, which thenceforward, and forever, was actuated by the
one movement of the hand this fact the mathematicians of our globe
well knew they made the special effects, indeed, wrought in the fluid
by special impulses, the subject of exact calculationso that it
became easy to determine in what precise period an impulse of given
extent would engirdle the orb, and impress forever every atom of the
atmosphere circumambient retrograding, they found no difficulty from
a given effect, under given conditions, in determining the value of
the original impulse now the mathematicians who saw that the results
of any given impulse were absolutely endlessand who saw that a
portion of these results were accurately traceable through the agency
of algebraic analysiswho saw, too, the facility of the
retrogradationthese men saw, at the same time, that this species of
analysis itself had within itself a capacity for indefinite
progressthat there were no bounds conceivable to its advancement and
applicability, except within the intellect of him who advanced or
applied it but at this point our mathematicians paused
oinos
and why, agathos, should they have proceeded?
agathos
because there were some considerations of deep interest beyond it was
deducible from what they knew, that to a being of infinite
understandingone to whom the perfection of the algebraic analysis
lay unfoldedthere could be no difficulty in tracing every impulse
given the airand the ether through the airto the remotest
consequences at any even infinitely remote epoch of time it is indeed
demonstrable that every such impulse given the air, must in the
end impress every individual thing that exists within the
universeand the being of infinite understandingthe being whom
we have imaginedmight trace the remote undulations of the
impulsetrace them upward and onward in their influences upon all
particles of all matterupward and onward forever in their
modifications of old formsor, in other words, in their creation of
newuntil he found them reflectedunimpressive at lastback from
the throne of the godhead and not only could such a being do this,
but at any epoch, should a given result be afforded himshould one of
these numberless comets, for example, be presented to his
inspectionhe could have no difficulty in determining, by the
analytic retrogradation, to what original impulse it was due this
power of retrogradation in its absolute fulness and perfectionthis
faculty of referring at all epochs, all effects to all
causesis of course the prerogative of the deity alonebut in every
variety of degree, short of the absolute perfection, is the power
itself exercised by the whole host of the angelic intelligences
oinos
but you speak merely of impulses upon the air
agathos
in speaking of the air, i referred only to the earth but the general
proposition has reference to impulses upon the etherwhich, since it
pervades, and alone pervades all space, is thus the great medium of
creation
oinos
then all motion, of whatever nature, creates?
agathos
it must but a true philosophy has long taught that the source of all
motion is thoughtand the source of all thought is
oinos
god
agathos
i have spoken to you, oinos, as to a child, of the fair earth which
lately perishedof impulses upon the atmosphere of the earth
oinos
you did
agathos
and while i thus spoke, did there not cross your mind some thought of
the physical power of words? is not every word an impulse on the
air?
oinos
but why, agathos, do you weepand why, oh, why do your wings droop as
we hover above this fair starwhich is the greenest and yet most
terrible of all we have encountered in our flight? its brilliant
flowers look like a fairy dreambut its fierce volcanoes like the
passions of a turbulent heart
agathos
they arethey arethis wild starit is now three centuries
since, with clasped hands, and with streaming eyes, at the feet of my
belovedi spoke itwith a few passionate sentencesinto birth its
brilliant flowers are the dearest of all unfulfilled dreams, and its
raging volcanoes are the passions of the most turbulent and
unhallowed of hearts

the colloquy of monos and una
greek mellonta  sauta
these things are in the future
sophoclesantig
una
born again?
monos
yes, fairest and best beloved una, born again these were the words
upon whose mystical meaning i had so long pondered, rejecting the
explanations of the priesthood, until death itself resolved for me the
secret
una
death
monos
how strangely, sweet una, you echo my words i observe, too, a
vacillation in your step, a joyous inquietude in your eyes you are
confused and oppressed by the majestic novelty of the life eternal
yes, it was of death i spoke and here how singularly sounds that word
which of old was wont to bring terror to all hearts, throwing a mildew
upon all pleasures
una
ah, death, the spectre which sate at all feasts how often, monos, did
we lose ourselves in speculations upon its nature how mysteriously
did it act as a check to human bliss, saying unto it, thus far, and
no farther that earnest mutual love, my own monos, which burned
within our bosoms, how vainly did we flatter ourselves, feeling happy
in its first upspringing that our happiness would strengthen with its
strength alas, as it grew, so grew in our hearts the dread of that
evil hour which was hurrying to separate us forever thus in time it
became painful to love hate would have been mercy then
monos
speak not here of these griefs, dear unamine, mine forever now
una
but the memory of past sorrow, is it not present joy? i have much to
say yet of the things which have been above all, i burn to know the
incidents of your own passage through the dark valley and shadow
monos
and when did the radiant una ask anything of her monos in vain? i will
be minute in relating all, but at what point shall the weird narrative
begin?
una
at what point?
monos
you have said
una
monos, i comprehend you in death we have both learned the propensity
of man to define the indefinable i will not say, then, commence with
the moment of lifes cessationbut commence with that sad, sad
instant when, the fever having abandoned you, you sank into a
breathless and motionless torpor, and i pressed down your pallid
eyelids with the passionate fingers of love
monos
one word first, my una, in regard to mans general condition at this
epoch you will remember that one or two of the wise among our
forefatherswise in fact, although not in the worlds esteemhad
ventured to doubt the propriety of the term improvement, as applied
to the progress of our civilization there were periods in each of the
five or six centuries immediately preceding our dissolution when arose
some vigorous intellect, boldly contending for those principles whose
truth appears now, to our disenfranchised reason, so utterly obvious
principles which should have taught our race to submit to the
guidance of the natural laws rather than attempt their control at
long intervals some masterminds appeared, looking upon each advance
in practical science as a retrogradation in the true utility
occasionally the poetic intellectthat intellect which we now feel to
have been the most exalted of allsince those truths which to us were
of the most enduring importance could only be reached by that
analogy which speaks in prooftones to the imagination alone, and to
the unaided reason bears no weightoccasionally did this poetic
intellect proceed a step farther in the evolving of the vague idea of
the philosophic, and find in the mystic parable that tells of the tree
of knowledge, and of its forbidden fruit, deathproducing, a distinct
intimation that knowledge was not meet for man in the infant condition
of his soul and these menthe poetsliving and perishing amid the
scorn of the utilitariansof rough pedants, who arrogated to
themselves a title which could have been properly applied only to the
scornedthese men, the poets, pondered piningly, yet not unwisely,
upon the ancient days when our wants were not more simple than our
enjoyments were keendays when mirth was a word unknown, so
solemnly deeptoned was happinessholy, august, and blissful days,
blue rivers ran undammed, between hills unhewn, into far forest
solitudes, primeval, odorous, and unexplored yet these noble
exceptions from the general misrule served but to strengthen it by
opposition alas we had fallen upon the most evil of all our evil
days the great movementthat was the cant termwent on a
diseased commotion, moral and physical artthe artsarose supreme,
and once enthroned, cast chains upon the intellect which had elevated
them to power man, because he could not but acknowledge the majesty
of nature, fell into childish exultation at his acquired and
stillincreasing dominion over her elements even while he stalked a
god in his own fancy, an infantine imbecility came over him as might
be supposed from the origin of his disorder, he grew infected with
system, and with abstraction he enwrapped himself in generalities
among other odd ideas, that of universal equality gained ground and
in the face of analogy and of godin despite of the loud warning
voice of the laws of gradation so visibly pervading all things in
earth and heavenwild attempts at an omniprevalent democracy were
made yet this evil sprang necessarily from the leading evil,
knowledge man could not both know and succumb meantime huge smoking
cities arose, innumerable green leaves shrank before the hot breath
of furnaces the fair face of nature was deformed as with the ravages
of some loathsome disease and methinks, sweet una, even our
slumbering sense of the forced and of the farfetched might have
arrested us here but now it appears that we had worked out our own
destruction in the perversion of our taste, or rather in the blind
neglect of its culture in the schools for, in truth, it was at this
crisis that taste alonethat faculty which, holding a middle position
between the pure intellect and the moral sense, could never safely
have been disregardedit was now that taste alone could have led us
gently back to beauty, to nature, and to life but alas for the pure
contemplative spirit and majestic intuition of plato alas for the
greek mousichae  which he justly regarded as an allsufficient
education for the soul alas for him and for itsince both were most
desperately needed, when both were most entirely forgotten or despised
pascal, a philosopher whom we both love, has said, how
trulyque tout notre raisonnement se rduit  cder au
sentiment and it is not impossible that the sentiment of the
natural, had time permitted it, would have regained its old ascendency
over the harsh mathematical reason of the schools but this thing was
not to be prematurely induced by intemperance of knowledge, the old
age of the world drew near this the mass of mankind saw not, or,
living lustily although unhappily, affected not to see but, for
myself, the earths records had taught me to look for widest ruin as
the price of highest civilization i had imbibed a prescience of our
fate from comparison of china the simple and enduring, with assyria
the architect, with egypt the astrologer, with nubia, more crafty than
either, the turbulent mother of all arts in the history of these
regions i met with a ray from the future the individual
artificialities of the three latter were local diseases of the earth,
and in their individual overthrows we had seen local remedies applied
but for the infected world at large i could anticipate no regeneration
save in death that man, as a race, should not become extinct, i saw
that he must be born again
and now it was, fairest and dearest, that we wrapped our spirits,
daily, in dreams now it was that, in twilight, we discoursed of the
days to come, when the artscarred surface of the earth, having
undergone that purification which alone could efface its rectangular
obscenities, should clothe itself anew in the verdure and the
mountainslopes and the smiling waters of paradise, and be rendered at
length a fit dwellingplace for manfor man the deathpurgedfor
man to whose now exalted intellect there should be poison in knowledge
no morefor the redeemed, regenerated, blissful, and now immortal,
but still for the material, man
una
well do i remember these conversations, dear monos but the epoch of
the fiery overthrow was not so near at hand as we believed, and as the
corruption you indicate did surely warrant us in believing men lived
and died individually you yourself sickened, and passed into the
grave and thither your constant una speedily followed you and though
the century which has since elapsed, and whose conclusion brings up
together once more, tortured our slumbering senses with no impatience
of duration, yet my monos, it was a century still
monos
say, rather, a point in the vague infinity unquestionably, it was in
the earths dotage that i died wearied at heart with anxieties which
had their origin in the general turmoil and decay, i succumbed to the
fierce fever after some few days of pain, and many of dreamy delirium
replete with ecstasy, the manifestations of which you mistook for
pain, while i longed but was impotent to undeceive youafter some
days there came upon me, as you have said, a breathless and motionless
torpor and this was termed death by those who stood around me
words are vague things my condition did not deprive me of sentience
it appeared to me not greatly dissimilar to the extreme quiescence of
him, who, having slumbered long and profoundly, lying motionless and
fully prostrate in a midsummer noon, begins to steal slowly back into
consciousness, through the mere sufficiency of his sleep, and without
being awakened by external disturbances
i breathed no longer the pulses were still the heart had ceased to
beat volition had not departed, but was powerless the senses were
unusually active, although eccentrically soassuming often each
others functions at random the taste and the smell were inextricably
confounded, and became one sentiment, abnormal and intense the
rosewater with which your tenderness had moistened my lips to the
last, affected me with sweet fancies of flowersfantastic flowers,
far more lovely than any of the old earth, but whose prototypes we
have here blooming around us the eyelids, transparent and bloodless,
offered no complete impediment to vision as volition was in abeyance,
the balls could not roll in their socketsbut all objects within the
range of the visual hemisphere were seen with more or less
distinctness the rays which fell upon the external retina, or into
the corner of the eye, producing a more vivid effect than those which
struck the front or interior surface yet, in the former instance,
this effect was so far anomalous that i appreciated it only as
soundsound sweet or discordant as the matters presenting
themselves at my side were light or dark in shadecurved or angular
in outline the hearing, at the same time, although excited in degree,
was not irregular in actionestimating real sounds with an
extravagance of precision, not less than of sensibility touch had
undergone a modification more peculiar its impressions were tardily
received, but pertinaciously retained, and resulted always in the
highest physical pleasure thus the pressure of your sweet fingers
upon my eyelids, at first only recognized through vision, at length,
long after their removal, filled my whole being with a sensual delight
immeasurable i say with a sensual delight all my perceptions were
purely sensual the materials furnished the passive brain by the
senses were not in the least degree wrought into shape by the deceased
understanding of pain there was some little of pleasure there was
much but of moral pain or pleasure none at all thus your wild sobs
floated into my ear with all their mournful cadences, and were
appreciated in their every variation of sad tone but they were soft
musical sounds and no more they conveyed to the extinct reason no
intimation of the sorrows which gave them birth while large and
constant tears which fell upon my face, telling the bystanders of a
heart which broke, thrilled every fibre of my frame with ecstasy
alone and this was in truth the death of which these bystanders
spoke reverently, in low whispersyou, sweet una, gaspingly, with
loud cries
they attired me for the coffinthree or four dark figures which
flitted busily to and fro as these crossed the direct line of my
vision they affected me as forms but upon passing to my side their
images impressed me with the idea of shrieks, groans, and, other
dismal expressions of terror, of horror, or of woe you alone, habited
in a white robe, passed in all directions musically about
the day waned and, as its light faded away, i became possessed by a
vague uneasinessan anxiety such as the sleeper feels when sad real
sounds fall continuously within his earlow distant belltones,
solemn, at long but equal intervals, and commingling with melancholy
dreams night arrived and with its shadows a heavy discomfort it
oppressed my limbs with the oppression of some dull weight, and was
palpable there was also a moaning sound, not unlike the distant
reverberation of surf, but more continuous, which, beginning with the
first twilight, had grown in strength with the darkness suddenly
lights were brought into the rooms, and this reverberation became
forthwith interrupted into frequent unequal bursts of the same sound,
but less dreary and less distinct the ponderous oppression was in a
great measure relieved and, issuing from the flame of each lamp for
there were many, there flowed unbrokenly into my ears a strain of
melodious monotone and when now, dear una, approaching the bed upon
which i lay outstretched, you sat gently by my side, breathing odor
from your sweet lips, and pressing them upon my brow, there arose
tremulously within my bosom, and mingling with the merely physical
sensations which circumstances had called forth, a something akin to
sentiment itselfa feeling that, half appreciating, half responded
to your earnest love and sorrow but this feeling took no root in the
pulseless heart, and seemed indeed rather a shadow than a reality, and
faded quickly away, first into extreme quiescence, and then into a
purely sensual pleasure as before
and now, from the wreck and the chaos of the usual senses, there
appeared to have arisen within me a sixth, all perfect in its
exercise i found a wild delightyet a delight still physical,
inasmuch as the understanding had in it no part motion in the animal
frame had fully ceased no muscle quivered no nerve thrilled no
artery throbbed but there seemed to have sprung up in the brain
that of which no words could convey to the merely human intelligence
even an indistinct conception let me term it a mental pendulous
pulsation it was the moral embodiment of mans abstract idea of
time by the absolute equalization of this movementor of such as
thishad the cycles of the firmamental orbs themselves been adjusted
by its aid i measured the irregularities of the clock upon the mantel,
and of the watches of the attendants their tickings came sonorously
to my ears the slightest deviations from the true proportionand
these deviations were omniprevalentaffected me just as violations of
abstract truth were wont on earth to affect the moral sense although
no two of the timepieces in the chamber struck the individual seconds
accurately together, yet i had no difficulty in holding steadily in
mind the tones, and the respective momentary errors of each and
thisthis keen, perfect selfexisting sentiment of durationthis
sentiment existing as man could not possibly have conceived it to
exist independently of any succession of eventsthis ideathis
sixth sense, upspringing from the ashes of the rest, was the first
obvious and certain step of the intemporal soul upon the threshold of
the temporal eternity
it was midnight and you still sat by my side all others had departed
from the chamber of death they had deposited me in the coffin the
lamps burned flickeringly for this i knew by the tremulousness of the
monotonous strains but suddenly these strains diminished in
distinctness and in volume finally they ceased the perfume in my
nostrils died away forms affected my vision no longer the oppression
of the darkness uplifted itself from my bosom a dull shot like that
of electricity pervaded my frame, and was followed by total loss of
the idea of contact all of what man has termed sense was merged in
the sole consciousness of entity, and in the one abiding sentiment of
duration the mortal body had been at length stricken with the hand of
the deadly decay
yet had not all of sentience departed for the consciousness and the
sentiment remaining supplied some of its functions by a lethargic
intuition i appreciated the direful change now in operation upon the
flesh, and, as the dreamer is sometimes aware of the bodily presence
of one who leans over him, so, sweet una, i still dully felt that you
sat by my side so, too, when the noon of the second day came, i was
not unconscious of those movements which displaced you from my side,
which confined me within the coffin, which deposited me within the
hearse, which bore me to the grave, which lowered me within it, which
heaped heavily the mould upon me, and which thus left me, in blackness
and corruption, to my sad and solemn slumbers with the worm
and here in the prisonhouse which has few secrets to disclose, there
rolled away days and weeks and months and the soul watched narrowly
each second as it flew, and, without effort, took record of its
flightwithout effort and without object
a year passed the consciousness of being had grown hourly more
indistinct, and that of mere locality had in great measure usurped
its position the idea of entity was becoming merged in that of
place the narrow space immediately surrounding what had been the
body was now growing to be the body itself at length, as often
happens to the sleeper by sleep and its world alone is death
imagedat length, as sometimes happened on earth to the deep
slumberer, when some flitting light half startled him into awaking,
yet left him half enveloped in dreamsso to me, in the strict embrace
of the shadow, came that light which alone might have had power to
startlethe light of enduring love men toiled at the grave in
which i lay darkling they upthrew the damp earth upon my mouldering
bones there descended the coffin of una and now again all was void
that nebulous light had been extinguished that feeble thrill had
vibrated itself into quiescence many lustra had supervened dust
had returned to dust the worm had food no more the sense of being
had at length utterly departed, and there reigned in its stead
instead of all things, dominant and perpetualthe autocrats place
and time for that which was notfor that which had no
formfor that which had no thoughtfor that which had no
sentiencefor that which was soundless, yet of which matter formed no
portionfor all this nothingness, yet for all this immortality, the
grave was still a home, and the corrosive hours, comates

and that last hourspeak of it remember that, beyond the naked fact
of the catastrophe itself, i know nothing when, coming out from among
mankind, i passed into night through the graveat that period, if i
remember aright, the calamity which overwhelmed you was utterly
unanticipated but, indeed, i knew little of the speculative
philosophy of the day
eiros
the individual calamity was, as you say, entirely unanticipated but
analogous misfortunes had been long a subject of discussion with
astronomers i need scarce tell you, my friend, that, even when you
left us, men had agreed to understand those passages in the most holy
writings which speak of the final destruction of all things by fire as
having reference to the orb of the earth alone, but in regard to the
immediate agency of the ruin, speculation had been at fault from that
epoch in astronomical knowledge in which the comets were divested of
the terrors of flame the very moderate density of these bodies had
been well established they had been observed to pass among the
satellites of jupiter without bringing about any sensible alteration
either in the masses or in the orbits of these secondary planets we
had long regarded the wanderers as vapory creations of inconceivable
tenuity, and as altogether incapable of doing injury to our
substantial globe, even in the event of contact but contact was not
in any degree dreaded for the elements of all the comets were
accurately known that among them we should look for the agency of
the threatened fiery destruction had been for many years considered an
inadmissible idea but wonders and wild fancies had been of late days
strangely rife among mankind and, although it was only with a few of
the ignorant that actual apprehension prevailed, upon the announcement
by astronomers of a new comet, yet this announcement was generally
received with i know not what of agitation and mistrust
the elements of the strange orb were immediately calculated, and it
was at once conceded by all observers that its path, at perihelion
would bring it into very close proximity with the earth there were
two or three astronomers of secondary note who resolutely maintained
that a contact was inevitable i cannot very well express to you the
effect of this intelligence upon the people for a few short days they
would not believe an assertion which their intellect, so long employed
among worldly considerations, could not in any manner grasp but the
truth of a vitally important fact soon makes its way into the
understanding of even the most stolid finally, all men saw that
astronomical knowledge lies not, and they awaited the comet its
approach was not at first seemingly rapid, nor was its appearance of
very unusual character it was of a dull red, and had little
perceptible train for seven or eight days we saw no material increase
in its apparent diameter, and but a partial alteration in its color
meantime, the ordinary affairs of men were discarded, and all interest
absorbed in a growing discussion instituted by the philosophic in
respect to the cometary nature even the grossly ignorant aroused
their sluggish capacities to such considerations the learned now
gave their intellecttheir soulto no such points as the allaying of
fear, or to the sustenance of loved theory they soughtthey panted
for right views they groaned for perfected knowledge truth arose
in the purity of her strength and exceeding majesty, and the wise
bowed down and adored
that material injury to our globe or to its inhabitants would result
from the apprehended contact was an opinion which hourly lost ground
among the wise and the wise were now freely permitted to rule the
reason and the fancy of the crowd it was demonstrated that the
density of the comets nucleus was far less than that of our rarest
gas and the harmless passage of a similar visitor among the
satellites of jupiter was a point strongly insisted upon, and which
served greatly to allay terror theologists, with an earnestness
fearenkindled, dwelt upon the biblical prophecies, and expounded them
to the people with a directness and simplicity of which no previous
instance had been known that the final destruction of the earth must
be brought about by the agency of fire, was urged with a spirit that
enforced everywhere conviction and that the comets were of no fiery
nature as all men now knew was a truth which relieved all, in a
great measure, from the apprehension of the great calamity foretold
it is noticeable that the popular prejudices and vulgar errors in
regard to pestilences and warserrors which were wont to prevail upon
every appearance of a cometwere now altogether unknown, as if by
some sudden convulsive exertion reason had at once hurled superstition
from her throne the feeblest intellect had derived vigor from
excessive interest
what minor evils might arise from the contact were points of elaborate
question the learned spoke of slight geological disturbances, of
probable alterations in climate, and consequently in vegetation of
possible magnetic and electric influences many held that no visible
or perceptible effect would in any manner be produced while such
discussions were going on, their subject gradually approached, growing
larger in apparent diameter, and of a more brilliant lustre mankind
grew paler as it came all human operations were suspended
there was an epoch in the course of the general sentiment when the
comet had attained, at length, a size surpassing that of any
previously recorded visitation the people now, dismissing any
lingering hope that the astronomers were wrong, experienced all the
certainty of evil the chimerical aspect of their terror was gone the
hearts of the stoutest of our race beat violently within their bosoms
a very few days suffered, however, to merge even such feelings in
sentiments more unendurable we could no longer apply to the strange
orb any accustomed thoughts its historical attributes had
disappeared it oppressed us with a hideous novelty of emotion we
saw it not as an astronomical phenomenon in the heavens, but as an
incubus upon our hearts and a shadow upon our brains it had taken,
with unconceivable rapidity, the character of a gigantic mantle of
rare flame, extending from horizon to horizon
yet a day, and men breathed with greater freedom it was clear that we
were already within the influence of the comet yet we lived we even
felt an unusual elasticity of frame and vivacity of mind the
exceeding tenuity of the object of our dread was apparent for all
heavenly objects were plainly visible through it meantime, our
vegetation had perceptibly altered and we gained faith, from this
predicted circumstance, in the foresight of the wise a wild
luxuriance of foliage, utterly unknown before, burst out upon every
vegetable thing
yet another dayand the evil was not altogether upon us it was now
evident that its nucleus would first reach us a wild change had come
over all men and the first sense of pain was the wild signal for
general lamentation and horror the first sense of pain lay in a
rigorous construction of the breast and lungs, and an insufferable
dryness of the skin it could not be denied that our atmosphere was
radically affected the conformation of this atmosphere and the
possible modifications to which it might be subjected, were now the
topics of discussion the result of investigation sent an electric
thrill of the intensest terror through the universal heart of man
it had been long known that the air which encircled us was a compound
of oxygen and nitrogen gases, in the proportion of twentyone measures
of oxygen and seventynine of nitrogen in every one hundred of the
atmosphere oxygen, which was the principle of combustion, and the
vehicle of heat, was absolutely necessary to the support of animal
life, and was the most powerful and energetic agent in nature
nitrogen, on the contrary, was incapable of supporting either animal
life or flame an unnatural excess of oxygen would result, it had been
ascertained, in just such an elevation of the animal spirits as we had
latterly experienced it was the pursuit, the extension of the idea,
which had engendered awe what would be the result of a total
extraction of the nitrogen? a combustion irresistible, alldevouring,
omniprevalent, immediatethe entire fulfilment, in all their
minute and terrible details, of the fiery and horrorinspiring
denunciations of the prophecies of the holy book
why need i paint, charmion, the now disenchained frenzy of mankind?
that tenuity in the comet which had previously inspired us with hope,
was now the source of the bitterness of despair in its impalpable
gaseous character we clearly perceived the consummation of fate
meantime a day again passedbearing away with it the last shadow of
hope we gasped in the rapid modification of the air the red blood
bounded tumultuously through its strict channels a furious delirium
possessed all men and with arms rigidly outstretched towards the
threatening heavens, they trembled and shrieked aloud but the nucleus
of the destroyer was now upon useven here in aidenn i shudder while
i speak let me be briefbrief as the ruin that overwhelmed for a
moment there was a wild lurid light alone, visiting and penetrating
all things thenlet us bow down, charmion, before the excessive
majesty of the great godthen, there came a shouting and pervading
sound, as if from the mouth itself of him while the whole incumbent
mass of ether in which we existed, burst at once into a species of
intense flame, for whose surpassing brilliancy and allfervid heat
even the angels in the high heaven of pure knowledge have no name
thus ended all

shadowa parable
yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow
psalm of david
ye who read are still among the living but i who write shall have long
since gone my way into the region of shadows for indeed strange things
shall happen, and secret things be known, and many centuries shall pass
away, ere these memorials be seen of men and, when seen, there will be
some to disbelieve and some to doubt, and yet a few who will find much
to ponder upon in the characters here graven with a stylus of iron
the year had been a year of terror, and of feeling more intense than
terror for which there is no name upon the earth for many prodigies and
signs had taken place, and far and wide, over sea and land, the black
wings of the pestilence were spread abroad to those, nevertheless,
cunning in the stars, it was not unknown that the heavens wore an aspect
of ill and to me, the greek oinos, among others, it was evident that
now had arrived the alternation of that seven hundred and ninetyfourth
year when, at the entrance of aries, the planet jupiter is enjoined with
the red ring of the terrible saturnus the peculiar spirit of the skies,
if i mistake not greatly, made itself manifest, not only in the physical
orb of the earth, but in the souls, imaginations, and meditations of
mankind
over some flasks of the red chian wine, within the walls of a noble
hall, in a dim city called ptolemais, we sat, at night, a company of
seven and to our chamber there was no entrance save by a lofty door of
brass and the door was fashioned by the artisan corinnos, and, being of
rare workmanship, was fastened from within black draperies, likewise in
the gloomy room, shut out from our view the moon, the lurid stars, and
the peopleless streetsbut the boding and the memory of evil, they
would not be so excluded there were things around us and about of which
i can render no distinct accountthings material and spiritual
heaviness in the atmospherea sense of suffocationanxietyand, above
all, that terrible state of existence which the nervous experience when
the senses are keenly living and awake, and meanwhile the powers of
thought lie dormant a dead weight hung upon us it hung upon our
limbsupon the household furnitureupon the goblets from which we
drank and all things were depressed, and borne down therebyall things
save only the flames of the seven iron lamps which illumined our revel
uprearing themselves in tall slender lines of light, they thus remained
burning all pallid and motionless and in the mirror which their lustre
formed upon the round table of ebony at which we sat each of us there
assembled beheld the pallor of his own countenance, and the unquiet
glare in the downcast eyes of his companions yet we laughed and were
merry in our proper waywhich was hysterical and sang the songs of
anacreonwhich are madness and drank deeplyalthough the purple wine
reminded us of blood for there was yet another tenant of our chamber in
the person of young zoilus dead and at full length he lay,
enshroudedthe genius and the demon of the scene alas he bore no
portion in our mirth, save that his countenance, distorted with the
plague, and his eyes in which death had but half extinguished the fire
of the pestilence, seemed to take such an interest in our merriment as
the dead may haply take in the merriment of those who are to die but
although i, oinos, felt that the eyes of the departed were upon me,
still i forced myself not to perceive the bitterness of their
expression, and gazing down steadily into the depths of the ebony
mirror, sang with a loud and sonorous voice the songs of the son of
teos but gradually my songs they ceased, and their echoes, rolling afar
off among the sable draperies of the chamber, became weak, and
undistinguishable, and so faded away and lo from among those sable
draperies, where the sounds of the song departed, there came forth a
dark and undefiled shadowa shadow such as the moon, when low in
heaven, might fashion from the figure of a man but it was the shadow
neither of man nor of god, nor of any familiar thing and quivering
awhile among the draperies of the room it at length rested in full view
upon the surface of the door of brass but the shadow was vague, and
formless, and indefinite, and was the shadow neither of man nor
godneither god of greece, nor god of chalda, nor any egyptian god
and the shadow rested upon the brazen doorway, and under the arch of the
entablature of the door and moved not, nor spoke any word, but there
became stationary and remained and the door whereupon the shadow rested
was, if i remember aright, over against the feet of the young zoilus
enshrouded but we, the seven there assembled, having seen the shadow as
it came out from among the draperies, dared not steadily behold it, but
cast down our eyes, and gazed continually into the depths of the mirror
of ebony and at length i, oinos, speaking some low words, demanded of
the shadow its dwelling and its appellation and the shadow answered, i
am shadow, and my dwelling is near to the catacombs of ptolemais, and
hard by those dim plains of helusion which border upon the foul
charonian canal and then did we, the seven, start from our seats in
horror, and stand trembling, and shuddering, and aghast for the tones
in the voice of the shadow were not the tones of any one being, but of a
multitude of beings, and varying in their cadences from syllable to
syllable, fell duskily upon our ears in the well remembered and familiar
accents of many thousand departed friends

silencea fable
the mountain pinnacles slumber valleys, crags, and caves are silent
listen to me, said the demon, as he placed his hand upon my head
the region of which i speak is a dreary region in libya, by the borders
of the river zire and there is no quiet there, nor silence
the waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue and they flow
not onward to the sea, but palpitate forever and forever beneath the red
eye of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive motion for many miles
on either side of the rivers oozy bed is a pale desert of gigantic
waterlilies they sigh one unto the other in that solitude, and stretch
towards the heaven their long and ghastly necks, and nod to and fro
their everlasting heads and there is an indistinct murmur which cometh
out from among them like the rushing of subterrene water and they sigh
one unto the other
but there is a boundary to their realmthe boundary of the dark,
horrible, lofty forest there, like the waves about the hebrides, the
low underwood is agitated continually but there is no wind throughout
the heaven and the tall primeval trees rock eternally hither and
thither with a crashing and mighty sound and from their high summits,
one by one, drop everlasting dews and at the roots, strange poisonous
flowers lie writhing in perturbed slumber and overhead, with a rustling
and loud noise, the gray clouds rush westwardly forever until they roll,
a cataract, over the fiery wall of the horizon but there is no wind
throughout the heaven and by the shores of the river zire there is
neither quiet nor silence
it was night, and the rain fell and, falling, it was rain, but, having
fallen, it was blood and i stood in the morass among the tall lilies,
and the rain fell upon my headand the lilies sighed one unto the other
in the solemnity of their desolation
and, all at once, the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist, and was
crimson in color and mine eyes fell upon a huge gray rock which stood
by the shore of the river and was lighted by the light of the moon and
the rock was gray and ghastly, and tall,and the rock was gray upon
its front were characters engraven in the stones and i walked through
the morass of waterlilies, until i came close unto the shore, that i
might read the characters upon the stone but i could not decipher them
and i was going back into the morass when the moon shone with a fuller
red, and i turned and looked again upon the rock and upon the
charactersand the characters were desolation
and i looked upwards, and there stood a man upon the summit of the
rock and i hid myself among the waterlilies that i might discover the
action of the man and the man was tall and stately in form, and wrapped
up from his shoulders to his feet in the toga of old rome and the
outlines of his figure were indistinctbut his features were the
features of a deity for the mantle of the night, and of the mist, and
of the moon, and of the dew, had left uncovered the features of his
face and his brow was lofty with thought, and his eye wild with care
and in the few furrows upon his cheek, i read the fables of sorrow, and
weariness, and disgust with mankind, and a longing after solitude
and the man sat upon the rock, and leaned his head upon his hand, and
looked out upon the desolation he looked down into the low unquiet
shrubbery, and up into the tall primeval trees, and up higher at the
rustling heaven, and into the crimson moon and i lay close within
shelter of the lilies, and observed the actions of the man and the man
trembled in the solitudebut the night waned, and he sat upon the
rock
and the man turned his attention from the heaven, and looked out upon
the dreary river zire, and upon the yellow ghastly waters, and upon the
pale legions of the waterlilies and the man listened to the sighs of
the waterlilies, and to the murmur that came up from among them and i
lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man and the
man trembled in the solitudebut the night waned, and he sat upon the
rock
then i went down into the recesses of the morass, and waded afar in
among the wilderness of the lilies, and called unto the hippopotami
which dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the morass and the
hippopotami heard my call, and came, with the behemoth, unto the foot of
the rock, and roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon and i lay
close within my covert and observed the actions of the man and the man
trembled in the solitudebut the night waned, and he sat upon the
rock
then i cursed the elements with the curse of tumult and a frightful
tempest gathered in the heaven, where before there had been no wind and
the heaven became livid with the violence of the tempestand the rain
beat upon the head of the manand the floods of the river came
downand the river was tormented into foamand the waterlilies
shrieked within their bedsand the forest crumbled before the windand
the thunder rolledand the lightning felland the rock rocked to its
foundation and i lay close within my covert and observed the actions of
the man and the man trembled in the solitudebut the night waned, and
he sat upon the rock
then i grew angry and cursed, with the curse of silence, the river, and
the lilies, and the wind, and the forest, and the heaven, and the
thunder, and the sighs of the waterlilies and they became accursed,
and were still and the moon ceased to totter up its pathway to
heavenand the thunder died awayand the lightning did not flashand
the clouds hung motionlessand the waters sunk to their level and
remainedand the trees ceased to rockand the waterlilies sighed no
moreand the murmur was heard no longer from among them, nor any shadow
of sound throughout the vast illimitable desert and i looked upon the
characters of the rock, and they were changedand the characters were
silence
and mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man, and his countenance
was wan with terror and, hurriedly, he raised his head from his hand,
and stood forth upon the rock and listened but there was no voice
throughout the vast illimitable desert, and the characters upon the rock
were silence and the man shuddered, and turned his face away, and fled
afar off, in haste, so that i beheld him no more

now there are fine tales in the volumes of the magiin the ironbound,
melancholy volumes of the magi therein, i say, are glorious histories
of the heaven, and of the earth, and of the mighty seaand of the genii
that overruled the sea, and the earth, and the lofty heaven there was
much lore, too, in the sayings which were said by the sybils and holy,
holy things were heard of old by the dim leaves that trembled around
dodonabut, as allah liveth, that fable which the demon told me as he
sat by my side in the shadow of the tomb, i hold to be the most
wonderful of all and as the demon made an end of his story, he fell
back within the cavity of the tomb and laughed and i could not laugh
with the demon, and he cursed me because i could not laugh and the lynx
which dwelleth forever in the tomb, came out therefrom, and lay down at
the feet of the demon, and looked at him steadily in the face

essays

the poetic principle
in speaking of the poetic principle, i have no design to be either
thorough or profound while discussing very much at random the
essentiality of what we call poetry, my principal purpose will be to
cite for consideration some few of those minor english or american poems
which best suit my own taste, or which, upon my own fancy, have left the
most definite impression by minor poems i mean, of course, poems of
little length and here, in the beginning, permit me to say a few words
in regard to a somewhat peculiar principle, which, whether rightfully or
wrongfully, has always had its influence in my own critical estimate of
the poem i hold that a long poem does not exist i maintain that the
phrase, a long poem, is simply a flat contradiction in terms
i need scarcely observe that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as
it excites, by elevating the soul the value of the poem is in the ratio
of this elevating excitement but all excitements are, through a psychal
necessity, transient that degree of excitement which would entitle a
poem to be so called at all, cannot be sustained throughout a
composition of any great length after the lapse of half an hour, at the
very utmost, it flagsfailsa revulsion ensuesand then the poem is,
in effect, and in fact, no longer such
there are, no doubt, many who have found difficulty in reconciling the
critical dictum that the paradise lost is to be devoutly admired
throughout, with the absolute impossibility of maintaining for it,
during perusal, the amount of enthusiasm which that critical dictum
would demand this great work, in fact, is to be regarded as poetical
only when, losing sight of that vital requisite in all works of art,
unity, we view it merely as a series of minor poems if, to preserve its
unityits totality of effect or impressionwe read it as would be
necessary at a single sitting, the result is but a constant alternation
of excitement and depression after a passage of what we feel to be true
poetry, there follows, inevitably, a passage of platitude which no
critical prejudgment can force us to admire but if, upon completing the
work, we read it again omitting the first bookthat is to say,
commencing with the secondwe shall be surprised at now finding that
admirable which we before condemnedthat damnable which we had
previously so much admired it follows from all this that the ultimate,
aggregate, or absolute effect of even the best epic under the sun, is a
nullityand this is precisely the fact
in regard to the iliad, we have, if not positive proof, at least very
good reason, for believing it intended as a series of lyrics but,
granting the epic intention, i can say only that the work is based in an
imperfect sense of art the modern epic is, of the supposititious
ancient model, but an inconsiderate and blindfold imitation but the day
of these artistic anomalies is over if, at any time, any very long poem
were popular in realitywhich i doubtit is at least clear that no
very long poem will ever be popular again
that the extent of a poetical work is ceteris paribus, the measure of
its merit, seems undoubtedly, when we thus state it, a proposition
sufficiently absurdyet we are indebted for it to the quarterly
reviews surely there can be nothing in mere size, abstractly
consideredthere can be nothing in mere bulk, so far as a volume is
concerned, which has so continuously elicited admiration from these
saturnine pamphlets a mountain, to be sure, by the mere sentiment of
physical magnitude which it conveys, does impress us with a sense of
the sublimebut no man is impressed after this fashion by the
material grandeur of even the columbiad even the quarterlies have not
instructed us to be so impressed by it as yet, they have not
insisted on our estimating lamartine by the cubic foot, or pollock by
the poundbut what else are we to infer from their continual prating
about sustained effort? if, by sustained effort, any little
gentleman has accomplished an epic, let us frankly commend him for the
effortif this indeed be a thing commendablebut let us forbear
praising the epic on the efforts account it is to be hoped thai common
sense, in the time to come, will prefer deciding upon a work of art
rather by the impression it makesby the effect it producesthan by
the time it took to impress the effect, or by the amount of sustained
effort which had been found necessary in effecting the impression the
fact is, that perseverance is one thing and genius quite anothernor
can all the quarterlies in christendom confound them by and by, this
proposition, with many which i have been just urging, will be received
as selfevident in the meantime, by being generally condemned as
falsities, they will not be essentially damaged as truths
on the other hand, it is clear that a poem may be improperly brief
undue brevity degenerates into mere epigrammatism a very short poem,
while now and then producing a brilliant or vivid, never produces a
profound or enduring effect there must be the steady pressing down of
the stamp upon the wax de branger has wrought innumerable things,
pungent and spiritstirring, but in general they have been too
imponderous to stamp themselves deeply into the public attention, and
thus, as so many feathers of fancy, have been blown aloft only to be
whistled down the wind
a remarkable instance of the effect of undue brevity in depressing a
poem, in keeping it out of the popular view, is afforded by the
following exquisite little serenade
i arise from dreams of thee
in the first sweet sleep of night
when the winds are breathing low,
and the stars are shining bright
i arise from dreams of thee,
and a spirit in my feet
has led mewho knows how?
to thy chamberwindow, sweet
the wandering airs they faint
on the dark the silent stream
the champak odors fail
like sweet thoughts in a dream
the nightingales complaint,
it dies upon her heart,
as i must die on thine,
o, beloved as thou art
o, lift me from the grass
i die, i faint, i fail
let thy love in kisses rain
on my lips and eyelids pale
my cheek is cold and white, alas
my heart beats loud and fast
o, press it close to thine again,
where it will break at last
very few perhaps are familiar with these lines, yet no less a poet than
shelley is their author their warm, yet delicate and ethereal
imagination will be appreciated by all, but by none so thoroughly as by
him who has himself arisen from sweet dreams of one beloved to bathe in
the aromatic air of a southern midsummer night
one of the finest poems by willis, the very best in my opinion which he
has ever written, has no doubt, through this same defect of undue
brevity, been kept back from its proper position, not less in the
critical than in the popular view
the shadows lay along broadway,
twas near the twilighttide
and slowly there a lady fair
was walking in her pride
alone walkd she but, viewlessly
walkd spirits at her side
peace charmd the street beneath her feet,
and honor charmd the air
and all astir looked kind on her,
and called her good as fair
for all god ever gave to her
she kept with chary care
she kept with care her beauties rare
from lovers warm and true
for heart was cold to all but gold,
and the rich came not to woo
but honord well her charms to sell,
if priests the selling do
now walking there was one more fair
a slight girl, lilypale
and she had unseen company
to make the spirit quail
twixt want and scorn she walkd forlorn,
and nothing could avail
no mercy now can clear her brow
from this worlds peace to pray,
for as loves wild prayer dissolved in air,
her womans heart gave way
but the sin forgiven by christ in heaven,
by man is cursed alway
in this composition we find it difficult to recognise the willis who has
written so many mere verses of society the lines are not only richly
ideal but full of energy, while they breathe an earnestness, an evident
sincerity of sentiment, for which we look in vain throughout all the
other works of this author
while the epic mania, while the idea that to merit in poetry prolixity
is indispensable, has for some years past been gradually dying out of
the public mind, by mere dint of its own absurdity, we find it succeeded
by a heresy too palpably false to be long tolerated, but one which, in
the brief period it has already endured, may be said to have
accomplished more in the corruption of our poetical literature than all
its other enemies combined i allude to the heresy of the didactic it
has been assumed, tacitly and avowedly, directly and indirectly, that
the ultimate object of all poetry is truth every poem, it is said,
should inculcate a moral, and by this moral is the poetical merit of the
work to be adjudged we americans especially have patronized this happy
idea, and we bostonians very especially have developed it in full we
have taken it into our heads that to write a poem simply for the poems
sake, and to acknowledge such to have been our design, would be to
confess ourselves radically wanting in the true poetic dignity and
forcebut the simple fact is that would we but permit ourselves to
look into our own souls we should immediately there discover that under
the sun there neither exists nor can exist any work more thoroughly
dignified, more supremely noble, than this very poem, this poem per
se, this poem which is a poem and nothing more, this poem written
solely for the poems sake
with as deep a reverence for the true as ever inspired the bosom of man,
i would nevertheless limit, in some measure, its modes of inculcation i
would limit to enforce them i would not enfeeble them by dissipation
the demands of truth are severe she has no sympathy with the myrtles
all that which is so indispensable in song is precisely all that
with which she has nothing whatever to do it is but making her a
flaunting paradox to wreathe her in gems and flowers in enforcing a
truth we need severity rather than efflorescence of language we must be
simple, precise, terse we must be cool, calm, unimpassioned in a word,
we must be in that mood which, as nearly as possible, is the exact
converse of the poetical he must be blind indeed who does not
perceive the radical and chasmal difference between the truthful and the
poetical modes of inculcation he must be theorymad beyond redemption
who, in spite of these differences, shall still persist in attempting to
reconcile the obstinate oils and waters of poetry and truth
dividing the world of mind into its three most immediately obvious
distinctions, we have the pure intellect, taste, and the moral sense i
place taste in the middle because it is just this position which in the
mind it occupies it holds intimate relations with either extreme but
from the moral sense is separated by so faint a difference that
aristotle has not hesitated to place some of its operations among the
virtues themselves nevertheless we find the offices of the trio
marked with a sufficient distinction just as the intellect concerns
itself with truth, so taste informs us of the beautiful, while the moral
sense is regardful of duty of this latter, while conscience teaches the
obligation, and reason the expediency, taste contents herself with
displaying the charms, waging war upon vice solely on the ground of her
deformity, her disproportion, her animosity to the fitting, to the
appropriate, to the harmonious, in a word, to beauty
an immortal instinct deep within the spirit of man is thus plainly a
sense of the beautiful this it is which administers to his delight in
the manifold forms, and sounds, and odors, and sentiments amid which he
exists and just as the lily is repeated in the lake, or the eyes of
amaryllis in the mirror, so is the mere oral or written repetition of
these forms, and sounds, and colors, and odors, and sentiments a
duplicate source of delight but this mere repetition is not poetry he
who shall simply sing, with however glowing enthusiasm, or with however
vivid a truth of description, of the sights, and sounds, and odors, and
colors, and sentiments which greet him in common with all mankindhe, i
say, has yet failed to prove his divine title there is still a
something in the distance which he has been unable to attain we have
still a thirst unquenchable, to allay which he has not shown us the
crystal springs this thirst belongs to the immortality of man it is at
once a consequence and an indication of his perennial existence it is
the desire of the moth for the star it is no mere appreciation of the
beauty before us, but a wild effort to reach the beauty above inspired
by an ecstatic prescience of the glories beyond the grave, we struggle
by multiform combinations among the things and thoughts of time to
attain a portion of that loveliness whose very elements perhaps
appertain to eternity alone and thus when by poetry, or when by music,
the most entrancing of the poetic moods, we find ourselves melted into
tears, we weep then, not as the abbate gravina supposes, through excess
of pleasure, but through a certain petulant, impatient sorrow at our
inability to grasp now, wholly, here on earth, at once and forever,
those divine and rapturous joys of which through the poem, or
through the music, we attain to but brief and indeterminate glimpses
the struggle to apprehend the supernal lovelinessthis struggle, on the
part of souls fittingly constitutedhas given to the world all that
which it the world has ever been enabled at once to understand and to
feel as poetic
the poetic sentiment, of course, may develop itself in various modesin
painting, in sculpture, in architecture, in the dancevery especially
in musicand very peculiarly, and with a wide field, in the composition
of the landscape garden our present theme, however, has regard only to
its manifestation in words and here let me speak briefly on the topic
of rhythm contenting myself with the certainty that music, in its
various modes of metre, rhythm, and rhyme, is of so vast a moment in
poetry as never to be wisely rejectedis so vitally important an
adjunct, that he is simply silly who declines its assistance, i will not
now pause to maintain its absolute essentiality it is in music perhaps
that the soul most nearly attains the great end for which, when inspired
by the poetic sentiment, it strugglesthe creation of supernal beauty
it may be, indeed, that here this sublime end is, now and, then,
attained in fact we are often made to feel, with a shivering delight,
that from an earthly harp are stricken notes which cannot have been
unfamiliar to the angels and thus there can be little doubt that in the
union of poetry with music in its popular sense, we shall find the
widest field for the poetic development the old bards and minnesingers
had advantages which we do not possessand thomas moore, singing his
own songs, was, in the most legitimate manner, perfecting them as poems
to recapitulate theni would define, in brief, the poetry of words as
the rhythmical creation of beauty its sole arbiter is taste with the
intellect or with the conscience it has only collateral relations
unless incidentally, it has no concern whatever either with duty or with
truth
a few words, however, in explanation that pleasure which is at once
the most pure, the most elevating, and the most intense, is derived, i
maintain, from the contemplation of the beautiful in the contemplation
of beauty we alone find it possible to attain that pleasurable
elevation, or excitement of the soul, which we recognize as the poetic
sentiment, and which is so easily distinguished from truth, which is the
satisfaction of the reason, or from passion, which is the excitement of
the heart i make beauty, thereforeusing the word as inclusive of the
sublimei make beauty the province of the poem, simply because it is an
obvious rule of art that effects should be made to spring as directly as
possible from their causesno one as yet having been weak enough to
deny that the peculiar elevation in question is at least most readily
attainable in the poem it by no means follows, however, that the
incitements of passion, or the precepts of duty, or even the lessons of
truth, may not be introduced into a poem, and with advantage for they
may subserve incidentally, in various ways, the general purposes of the
work but the true artist will always contrive to tone them down in
proper subjection to that beauty which is the atmosphere and the real
essence of the poem
i cannot better introduce the few poems which i shall present for your
consideration, than by the citation of the prem to longfellows waif
the day is done, and the darkness
falls from the wings of night,
as a feather is wafted downward
from an eagle in his flight
i see the lights of the village
gleam through the rain and the mist,
and a feeling of sadness comes oer me,
that my soul cannot resist
a feeling of sadness and longing,
that is not akin to pain,
and resembles sorrow only
as the mist resembles the rain
come, read to me some poem,
some simple and heartfelt lay,
that shall soothe this restless feeling,
and banish the thoughts of day
not from the grand old masters,
not from the bards sublime,
whose distant footsteps echo
through the corridors of time
for, like strains of martial music,
their mighty thoughts suggest
lifes endless toil and endeavor
and tonight i long for rest
read from some humbler poet,
whose songs gushed from his heart,
as showers from the clouds of summer,
or tears from the eyelids start
who through long days of labor,
and nights devoid of ease,
still heard in his soul the music
of wonderful melodies
such songs have power to quiet
the restless pulse of care,
and come like the benediction
that follows after prayer
then read from the treasured volume
the poem of thy choice,
and lend to the rhyme of the poet
the beauty of thy voice
and the night shall be filled with music,
and the cares that infest the day,
shall fold their tents like the arabs,
and as silently steal away
with no great range of imagination, these lines have been justly admired
for their delicacy of expression some of the images are very effective
nothing can be better than
the bards sublime,
whose distant footsteps echo
down the corridors of time
the idea of the last quatrain is also very effective the poem on the
whole, however, is chiefly to be admired for the graceful insouciance
of its metre, so well in accordance with the character of the
sentiments, and especially for the ease of the general manner this
ease or naturalness, in a literary style, it has long been the fashion
to regard as ease in appearance aloneas a point of really difficult
attainment but not soa natural manner is difficult only to him who
should never meddle with itto the unnatural it is but the result of
writing with the understanding, or with the instinct, that the tone,
in composition, should always be that which the mass of mankind would
adoptand must perpetually vary, of course, with the occasion the
author who, after the fashion of the north american review, should be
upon all occasions merely quiet, must necessarily upon many
occasions be simply silly, or stupid and has no more right to be
considered easy or natural than a cockney exquisite, or than the
sleeping beauty in the waxworks
among the minor poems of bryant, none has so much impressed me as the
one which he entitles june i quote only a portion of it
there, through the long, long summer hours,
the golden light should lie,
and thick young herbs and groups of flowers
stand in their beauty by
the oriole should build and tell
his lovetale, close beside my cell
the idle butterfly
should rest him there, and there be heard
the housewifebee and humming bird
and what, if cheerful shouts at noon,
come, from the village sent,
or songs of maids, beneath the moon,
with fairy laughter blent?
and what if, in the evening light,
betrothed lovers walk in sight
of my low monument?
i would the lovely scene around
might know no sadder sight nor sound
i know, i know i should not see
the seasons glorious show,
nor would its brightness shine for me
nor its wild music flow
but if, around my place of sleep,
the friends i love should come to weep,
they might not haste to go
soft airs and song, and light and bloom,
should keep them lingering by my tomb
these to their softend hearts should bear
the thought of what has been,
and speak of one who cannot share
the gladness of the scene
whose part in all the pomp that fills
the circuit of the summer hills,
isthat his grave is green
and deeply would their hearts rejoice
to hear again his living voice
the rhythmical flow here is even voluptuousnothing could be more
melodious the poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner the
intense melancholy which seems to well up, perforce, to the surface of
all the poets cheerful sayings about his grave, we find thrilling us to
the soulwhile there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill the
impression left is one of a pleasurable sadness and if, in the
remaining compositions which i shall introduce to you, there be more or
less of a similar tone always apparent, let me remind you that how or
why we know not this certain taint of sadness is inseparably connected
with all the higher manifestations of true beauty it is, nevertheless,
a feeling of sadness and longing
that is not akin to pain,
and resembles sorrow only
as the mist resembles the rain
the taint of which i speak is clearly perceptible even in a poem so full
of brilliancy and spirit as the health of edward coote pinkney
i fill this cup to one made up
of loveliness alone,
a woman, of her gentle sex
the seeming paragon
to whom the better elements
and kindly stars have given
a form so fair, that like the air,
tis less of earth than heaven
her every tone is musics own,
like those of morning birds,
and something more than melody
dwells ever in her words
the coinage of her heart are they,
and from her lips each flows
as one may see the burdend bee
forth issue from the rose
affections are as thoughts to her,
the measures of her hours
her feelings have the fragrancy,
the freshness of young flowers
and lovely passions, changing oft,
so fill her, she appears
the image of themselves by turns,
the idol of past years
of her bright face one glance will trace
a picture on the brain,
and of her voice in echoing hearts
a sound must long remain
but memory, such as mine of her,
so very much endears,
when death is nigh my latest sigh
will not be lifes, but hers
i filld this cup to one made up
of loveliness alone,
a woman, of her gentle sex
the seeming paragon
her health and would on earth there stood,
some more of such a frame,
that life might be all poetry,
and weariness a name
it was the misfortune of mr pinkney to have been born too far south
had he been a new englander, it is probable that he would have been
ranked as the first of american lyrists by that magnanimous cabal which
has so long controlled the destinies of american letters, in conducting
the thing called the north american review the poem just cited is
especially beautiful but the poetic elevation which it induces we must
refer chiefly to our sympathy in the poets enthusiasm we pardon his
hyperboles for the evident earnestness with which they are uttered
it was by no means my design, however, to expatiate upon the merits
of what i should read you these will necessarily speak for themselves
boccalina, in his advertisements from parnassus, tells us that zoilus
once presented apollo a very caustic criticism upon a very admirable
bookwhereupon the god asked him for the beauties of the work he
replied that he only busied himself about the errors on hearing this,
apollo, handing him a sack of unwinnowed wheat, bade him pick out all
the chaff for his reward
now this fable answers very well as a hit at the criticsbut i am by no
means sure that the god was in the right i am by no means certain that
the true limits of the critical duty are not grossly misunderstood
excellence, in a poem especially, may be considered in the light of an
axiom, which need only be properly put, to become selfevident it is
not excellence if it require to be demonstrated its suchand thus to
point out too particularly the merits of a work of art, is to admit that
they are not merits altogether
among the melodies of thomas moore is one whose distinguished
character as a poem proper seems to have been singularly left out of
view i allude to his lines beginningcome, rest in this bosom the
intense energy of their expression is not surpassed by anything in
byron there are two of the lines in which a sentiment is conveyed that
embodies the all in all of the divine passion of lovea sentiment
which, perhaps, has found its echo in more, and in more passionate,
human hearts that any other single sentiment ever embodied in words
come, rest in this bosom, my own stricken deer,
though the herd have fled from thee, thy home is still here
here still is the smile, that no cloud can oercast,
and a heart and a hand all thy own to the last
oh what was love made for, if tis not the same
through joy and through torment, through glory and shame?
i know not, i ask not, if guilts in that heart,
i but know that i love thee, whatever thou art
thou hast calld me thy angel in moments of bliss,
and thy angel ill be,mid the horrors of this,
through the furnace, unshrinking, thy steps to pursue,
and shield thee, and save thee,or perish there too
it has been the fashion of late days to deny moore imagination, while
granting him fancya distinction originating with coleridgethan whom
no man more fully comprehended the great powers of moore the fact is,
that the fancy of this poet so far predominates over all his other
faculties, and over the fancy of all other men, as to have induced, very
naturally, the idea that he is fanciful only but never was there a
greater mistake never was a grosser wrong done the fame of a true poet
in the compass of the english language i can call to mind no poem more
profoundlymore weirdly imaginative, in the best sense, than the
lines commencingi would i were by that dim lakewhich are the
composition of thomas moore i regret that i am unable to remember them
one of the noblestand, speaking of fancyone of the most singularly
fanciful of modern poets, was thomas hood his fair ines had always
for me an inexpressible charm
o saw ye not fair ines?
shes gone into the west,
to dazzle when the sun is down
and rob the world of rest
she took our daylight with her,
the smiles that we love best,
with morning blushes on her cheek,
and pearls upon her breast
o turn again, fair ines,
before the fall of night,
for fear the moon should shine alone,
and stars unrivalld bright
and blessed will the lover be
that walks beneath their light,
and breathes the love against thy cheek
i dare not even write
would i had been, fair ines,
that gallant cavalier,
who rode so gaily by thy side,
and whisperd thee so near
were there no bonny dames at home,
or no true lovers here,
that he should cross the seas to win
the dearest of the dear?
i saw thee, lovely ines,
descend along the shore,
with bands of noble gentlemen,
and bannerswaved before
and gentle youth and maidens gay,
and snowy plumes they wore
it would have been a beauteous dream,
if it had been no more
alas, alas, fair ines,
she went away with song,
with music waiting on her steps,
and shoutings of the throng
but some were sad and felt no mirth,
but only musics wrong,
in sounds that sang farewell, farewell,
to her youve loved so long
farewell, farewell, fair ines,
that vessel never bore
so fair a lady on its deck,
nor danced so light before,
alas for pleasure on the sea,
and sorrow on the shore
the smile that blest one lovers heart
has broken many more
the haunted house, by the same author, is one of the truest poems ever
written,one of the truest, one of the most unexceptionable, one of the
most thoroughly artistic, both in its theme and in its execution it is,
moreover, powerfully idealimaginative i regret that its length
renders it unsuitable for the purposes of this lecture in place of it
permit me to offer the universally appreciated bridge of sighs
one more unfortunate,
weary of breath,
rashly importunate
gone to her death
take her up tenderly,
lift her with care
fashiond so slenderly,
young and so fair
look at her garments
clinging like cerements
whilst the wave constantly
drips from her clothing
take her up instantly,
loving, not loathing
touch her not scornfully
think of her mournfully,
gently and humanly
not of the stains of her,
all that remains of her
now is pure womanly
make no deep scrutiny
into her mutiny
rash and undutiful
past all dishonor,
death has left on her
only the beautiful
where the lamps quiver
so far in the river,
with many a light
from window and casement,
from garret to basement,
she stood, with amazement,
houseless by night
the bleak wind of march
made her tremble and shiver
but not the dark arch,
or the black flowing river
mad from lifes history,
glad to deaths mystery,
swift to be hurld
anywhere, anywhere
out of the world
in she plunged boldly,
no matter how coldly
the rough river ran,
over the brink of it,
picture it,think of it,
dissolute man
lave in it, drink of it
then, if you can
still, for all slips of hers,
one of eves family
wipe those poor lips of hers
oozing so clammily,
loop up her tresses
escaped from the comb,
her fair auburn tresses
whilst wonderment guesses
where was her home?
who was her father?
who was her mother
had she a sister?
had she a brother?
or was there a dearer one
still, and a nearer one
yet, than all other?
alas for the rarity
of christian charity
under the sun
oh it was pitiful
near a whole city full,
home she had none
sisterly, brotherly,
fatherly, motherly,
feelings had changed
love, by harsh evidence,
thrown from its eminence
even gods providence
seeming estranged
take her up tenderly
lift her with care
fashiond so slenderly,
young, and so fair
ere her limbs frigidly
stiffen too rigidly,
decently,kindly,
smooth and compose them
and her eyes, close them,
staring so blindly
dreadfully staring
through muddy impurity,
as when with the daring
last look of despairing
fixed on futurity
perishing gloomily,
spurred by contumely,
cold inhumanity,
burning insanity,
into her rest,
cross her hands humbly,
as if praying dumbly,
over her breast
owning her weakness,
her evil behavior,
and leaving, with meekness,
her sins to her saviour
the vigor of this poem is no less remarkable than its pathos the
versification, although carrying the fanciful to the very verge of the
fantastic, is nevertheless admirably adapted to the wild insanity which
is the thesis of the poem
among the minor poems of lord byron is one which has never received from
the critics the praise which it undoubtedly deserves
though the day of my destinys over,
and the star of my fate hath declined,
thy soft heart refused to discover
the faults which so many could find
though thy soul with my grief was acquainted,
it shrunk not to share it with me,
and the love which my spirit hath painted
it never hath found but in thee
then when nature around me is smiling,
the last smile which answers to mine,
i do not believe it beguiling,
because it reminds me of thine
and when winds are at war with the ocean,
as the breasts i believed in with me,
if their billows excite an emotion,
it is that they bear me from thee
though the rock of my last hope is shivered,
and its fragments are sunk in the wave,
though i feel that my soul is delivered
to painit shall not be its slave
there is many a pang to pursue me
they may crush, but they shall not contemn
they may torture, but shall not subdue me
tis of thee that i thinknot of them
though human, thou didst not deceive me,
though woman, thou didst not forsake,
though loved, thou forborest to grieve me,
though slandered, thou never couldst shake,
though trusted, thou didst not disclaim me,
though parted, it was not to fly,
though watchful, twas not to defame me,
nor mute, that the world might belie
yet i blame not the world, nor despise it,
nor the war of the many with one
if my soul was not fitted to prize it,
twas folly not sooner to shun
and if dearly that error hath cost me,
and more than i once could foresee,
i have found that whatever it lost me,
it could not deprive me of thee
from the wreck of the past, which hath perished,
thus much i at least may recall,
it hath taught me that which i most cherished
deserved to be dearest of all
in the desert a fountain is springing,
in the wide waste there still is a tree,
and a bird in the solitude singing,
which speaks to my spirit of thee
although the rhythm here is one of the most difficult, the versification
could scarcely be improved no nobler theme ever engaged the pen of
poet it is the soulelevating idea that no man can consider himself
entitled to complain of fate while in his adversity he still retains the
unwavering love of woman
from alfred tennyson, although in perfect sincerity i regard him as the
noblest poet that ever lived, i have left myself time to cite only a
very brief specimen i call him, and think him the noblest of poets,
not because the impressions he produces are at all times the most
profoundnot because the poetical excitement which he induces is at
all times the most intensebut because it is at all times the most
etherealin other words, the most elevating and most pure no poet is
so little of the earth, earthy what i am about to read is from his last
long poem, the princess
tears, idle tears, i know not what they mean,
tears from the depth of some divine despair
rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,
in looking on the happy autumn fields,
and thinking of the days that are no more
fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,
that brings our friends up from the underworld,
sad as the last which reddens over one
that sinks with all we love below the verge
so sad, so fresh, the days that are no more
ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns
the earliest pipe of halfawakend birds
to dying ears, when unto dying eyes
the casement slowly grows a glimmering square
so sad, so strange, the days that are no more
dear as rememberd kisses after death,
and sweet as those by hopeless fancy feignd
on lips that are for others deep as love,
deep as first love, and wild with all regret
o death in life, the days that are no more
thus, although in a very cursory and imperfect manner, i have endeavored
to convey to you my conception of the poetic principle it has been my
purpose to suggest that, while this principle itself is strictly and
simply the human aspiration for supernal beauty, the manifestation of
the principle is always found in an elevating excitement of the soul,
quite independent of that passion which is the intoxication of the
heart, or of that truth which is the satisfaction of the reason for in
regard to passion, alas its tendency is to degrade rather than to
elevate the soul love, on the contrarylovethe true, the divine
erosthe uranian as distinguished from the dionasan venusis
unquestionably the purest and truest of all poetical themes and in
regard to truth, if, to be sure, through the attainment of a truth we
are led to perceive a harmony where none was apparent before, we
experience at once the true poetical effect but this effect is
referable to the harmony alone, and not in the least degree to the truth
which merely served to render the harmony manifest
we shall reach, however, more immediately a distinct conception of what
true poetry is, by mere reference to a few of the simple elements which
induce in the poet himself the true poetical effect he recognizes the
ambrosia which nourishes his soul in the bright orbs that shine in
heaven, in the volutes of the flower, in the clustering of low
shrubberies, in the waving of the grainfields, in the slanting of tall
eastern trees, in the blue distance of mountains, in the grouping of
clouds, in the twinkling of halfhidden brooks, in the gleaming of
silver rivers, in the repose of sequestered lakes, in the starmirroring
depths of lonely wells he perceives it in the songs of birds, in the
harp of olus, in the sighing of the nightwind, in the repining voice
of the forest, in the surf that complains to the shore, in the fresh
breath of the woods, in the scent of the violet, in the voluptuous
perfume of the hyacinth, in the suggestive odor that comes to him at
eventide from fardistant undiscovered islands, over dim oceans,
illimitable and unexplored he owns it in all noble thoughts, in all
unworldly motives, in all holy impulses, in all chivalrous, generous,
and selfsacrificing deeds he feels it in the beauty of woman, in the
grace of her step, in the lustre of her eye, in the melody of her voice,
in her soft laughter, in her sigh, in the harmony of the rustling of her
robes he deeply feels it in her winning endearments, in her burning
enthusiasms, in her gentle charities, in her meek and devotional
endurance, but above all, ah, far above all, he kneels to it, he
worships it in the faith, in the purity, in the strength, in the
altogether divine majesty of her love
let me conclude by the recitation of yet another brief poem, one very
different in character from any that i have before quoted it is by
motherwell, and is called the song of the cavalier with our modern
and altogether rational ideas of the absurdity and impiety of warfare,
we are not precisely in that frame of mind best adapted to sympathize
with the sentiments, and thus to appreciate the real excellence of the
poem to do this fully we must identify ourselves in fancy with the soul
of the old cavalier
a steed a steed of matchless speede
a sword of metal keene
al else to noble heartes is drosse
al else on earth is meane
the neighynge of the warhorse prowde
the rowleing of the drum,
the clangor of the trumpet lowde
be soundes from heaven that come
and oh the thundering presse of knightes,
when as their warcryes welle,
may tole from heaven an angel bright,
and rowse a fiend from hell,
then mounte then mounte, brave gallants all,
and don your helmes amaine,
deathes couriers, fame and honor, call
us to the field againe
no shrewish teares shall fill your eye
when the swordhilts in our hand,
heartwhole well part, and no whit sighe
for the fayrest of the land
let piping swaine, and craven wight,
thus weepe and puling crye,
our business is like men to fight,
and herolike to die

the philosophy of composition
charles dickens, in a note now lying before me, alluding to an
examination i once made of the mechanism of barnaby rudge, saysby
the way, are you aware that godwin wrote his caleb williams backwards?
he first involved his hero in a web of difficulties, forming the second
volume, and then, for the first, cast about him for some mode of
accounting for what had been done
i cannot think this the precise mode of procedure on the part of
godwinand indeed what he himself acknowledges is not altogether in
accordance with mr dickenss ideabut the author of caleb williams
was too good an artist not to perceive the advantage derivable from at
least a somewhat similar process nothing is more clear than that every
plot, worth the name, must be elaborated to its dnouement before
anything be attempted with the pen it is only with the dnouement
constantly in view that we can give a plot its indispensable air of
consequence, or causation, by making the incidents, and especially the
tone at all points, tend to the development of the intention
there is a radical error, i think, in the usual mode of constructing a
story either history affords a thesisor one is suggested by an
incident of the dayor, at best, the author sets himself to work in the
combination of striking events to form merely the basis of his
narrativedesigning, generally, to fill in with description, dialogue,
or autorial comment, whatever crevices of fact or action may, from page
to page, render themselves apparent
i prefer commencing with the consideration of an effect keeping
originality always in viewfor he is false to himself who ventures to
dispense with so obvious and so easily attainable a source of
interesti say to myself, in the first place, of the innumerable
effects or impressions of which the heart, the intellect, or more
generally the soul is susceptible, what one shall i, on the present
occasion, select? having chosen a novel first, and secondly, a vivid
effect, i consider whether it can be best wrought by incident or
tonewhether by ordinary incidents and peculiar tone, or the converse,
or by peculiarity both of incident and toneafterwards looking about me
or rather within for such combinations of events or tone as shall best
aid me in the construction of the effect
i have often thought how interesting a magazine paper might be written
by any author who wouldthat is to say, who coulddetail, step by
step, the processes by which any one of his compositions attained its
ultimate point of completion why such a paper has never been given to
the world, i am much at a loss to saybut perhaps the autorial vanity
has had more to do with the omission than any one other cause most
writerspoets in especialprefer having it understood that they
compose by a species of fine frenzyan ecstatic intuitionand would
positively shudder at letting the public take a peep behind the scenes,
at the elaborate and vacillating crudities of thoughtat the true
purposes seized only at the last momentat the innumerable glimpses of
idea that arrived not at the maturity of full viewat the fullymatured
fancies discarded in despair as unmanageableat the cautious selections
and rejectionsat the painful erasures and interpolations,in a word,
at the wheels and pinions, the tackle for sceneshifting, the
stepladders and demontraps, the cocks feathers, the red paint, and
the black patches, which, in ninetynine cases out of the hundred,
constitute the properties of the literary histrio
i am aware, on the other hand, that the case is by no means common, in
which an author is at all in condition to retrace the steps by which his
conclusions have been attained in general, suggestions, having arisen
pellmell, are pursued and forgotten in a similar manner
for my own part, i have neither sympathy with the repugnance alluded to,
nor, at any time, the least difficulty in recalling to mind the
progressive steps of any of my compositions and, since the interest of
an analysis, or reconstruction, such as i have considered a
desideratum, is quite independent of any real or fancied interest in
the thing analyzed, it will not be regarded as a breach of decorum on my
part to show the modus operandi by which some one of my own works was
put together i select the raven as most generally known it is my
design to render it manifest that no one point in its composition is
referrible either to accident or intuitionthat the work proceeded,
step by step, to its completion with the precision and rigid consequence
of a mathematical problem
let us dismiss, as irrelevant to the poem, per se, the
circumstanceor say the necessitywhich, in the first place, gave rise
to the intention of composing a poem that should suit at once the
popular and the critical taste
we commence, then, with this intention
the initial consideration was that of extent if any literary work is
too long to be read at one sitting, we must be content to dispense with
the immensely important effect derivable from unity of impressionfor,
if two sittings be required, the affairs of the world interfere, and
everything like totality is at once destroyed but since, ceteris
paribus, no poet can afford to dispense with anything that may
advance his design, it but remains to be seen whether there is, in
extent, any advantage to counterbalance the loss of unity which attends
it here i say no, at once what we term a long poem is, in fact, merely
a succession of brief onesthat is to say, of brief poetical effects
it is needless to demonstrate that a poem is such only inasmuch as it
intensely excites, by elevating the soul and all intense excitements
are, through a psychal necessity, brief for this reason, at least
onehalf of the paradise lost is essentially prosea succession of
poetical excitements interspersed, inevitably, with corresponding
depressionsthe whole being deprived, through the extremeness of its
length, of the vastly important artistic element, totality, or unity of
effect
it appears evident, then, that there is a distinct limit, as regards
length, to all works of literary artthe limit of a single sittingand
that, although in certain classes of prose composition, such as
robinson crusoe demanding no unity, this limit may be advantageously
overpassed, it can never properly be overpassed in a poem within this
limit, the extent of a poem may be made to bear mathematical relation to
its meritin other words, to the excitement or elevationagain, in
other words, to the degree of the true poetical effect which it is
capable of inducing for it is clear that the brevity must be in direct
ratio of the intensity of the intended effectthis, with one
provisothat a certain degree of duration is absolutely requisite for
the production of any effect at all
holding in view these considerations, as well as that degree of
excitement which i deemed not above the popular, while not below the
critical taste, i reached at once what i conceived the proper length
for my intended poema length of about one hundred lines it is, in
fact, a hundred and eight
my next thought concerned the choice of an impression, or effect, to be
conveyed and here i may as well observe that, throughout the
construction, i kept steadily in view the design of rendering the work
universally appreciable i should be carried too far out of my
immediate topic were i to demonstrate a point upon which i have
repeatedly insisted, and which, with the poetical, stands not in the
slightest need of demonstrationthe point, i mean, that beauty is the
sole legitimate province of the poem a few words, however, in
elucidation of my real meaning, which some of my friends have evinced a
disposition to misrepresent that pleasure which is at once the most
intense, the most elevating, and the most pure, is, i believe, found in
the contemplation of the beautiful when, indeed, men speak of beauty,
they mean, precisely, not a quality, as is supposed, but an effectthey
refer, in short, just to that intense and pure elevation of soul
not of intellect, or of heartupon which i have commented, and
which is experienced in consequence of contemplating the beautiful
now i designate beauty as the province of the poem, merely because it is
an obvious rule of art that effects should be made to spring from direct
causesthat objects should be attained through means best adapted for
their attainmentno one as yet having been weak enough to deny that the
peculiar elevation alluded to is most readily attained in the poem
now the object truth, or the satisfaction of the intellect, and the
object passion, or the excitement of the heart, are, although attainable
to a certain extent in poetry, far more readily attainable in prose
truth, in fact, demands a precision, and passion a homeliness the
truly passionate will comprehend me which are absolutely antagonistic
to that beauty which, i maintain, is the excitement, or pleasurable
elevation, of the soul it by no means follows from anything here said
that passion, or even truth, may not be introduced, and even profitably
introduced, into a poemfor they may serve in elucidation, or aid the
general effect, as do discords in music, by contrastbut the true
artist will always contrive, first, to tone them into proper
subservience to the predominant aim, and secondly, to enveil them, as
far as possible, in that beauty which is the atmosphere and the essence
of the poem
regarding, then, beauty as my province, my next question referred to the
tone of its highest manifestationand all experience has shown that
this tone is one of sadness beauty of whatever kind, in its supreme
development, invariably excites the sensitive soul to tears melancholy
is thus the most legitimate of all the poetical tones
the length, the province, and the tone being thus determined, i betook
myself to ordinary induction, with the view of obtaining some artistic
piquancy which might serve me as a keynote in the construction of the
poemsome pivot upon which the whole structure might turn in carefully
thinking over all the usual artistic effectsor more properly points,
in the theatrical sensei did not fail to perceive immediately that no
one had been so universally employed as that of the refrain the
universality of its employment sufficed to assure me of its intrinsic
value, and spared me the necessity of submitting it to analysis i
considered it, however, with regard to its susceptibility of
improvement, and soon saw it to be in a primitive condition as commonly
used, the refrain, or burden, not only is limited to lyric verse, but
depends for its impression upon the force of monotoneboth in sound and
thought the pleasure is deduced solely from the sense of identityof
repetition i resolved to diversify, and so heighten the effect, by
adhering in general to the monotone of sound, while i continually varied
that of thought that is to say, i determined to produce continuously
novel effects, by the variation of the application of the
refrainthe refrain itself remaining, for the most part, unvaried
these points being settled, i next bethought me of the nature of my
refrain since its application was to be repeatedly varied, it was
clear that the refrain itself must be brief, for there would have been
an insurmountable difficulty in frequent variations of application in
any sentence of length in proportion to the brevity of the sentence
would of course be the facility of the variation this led me at once to
a single word as the best refrain
the question now arose as to the character of the word having made up
my mind to a refrain, the division of the poem into stanzas was of
course a corollary, the refrain forming the close to each stanza that
such a close, to have force, must be sonorous and susceptible of
protracted emphasis, admitted no doubt, and these considerations
inevitably led me to the long o as the most sonorous vowel in
connection with r as the most producible consonant
the sound of the refrain being thus determined, it became necessary to
select a word embodying this sound, and at the same time in the fullest
possible keeping with that melancholy which i had predetermined as the
tone of the poem in such a search it would have been absolutely
impossible to overlook the word nevermore in fact, it was the very
first which presented itself
the next desideratum was a pretext for the continuous use of the one
word nevermore in observing the difficulty which i at once found in
inventing a sufficiently plausible reason for its continuous repetition,
i did not fail to perceive that this difficulty arose solely from the
preassumption that the word was to be so continuously or monotonously
spoken by a human beingi did not fail to perceive, in short, that
the difficulty lay in the reconciliation of this monotony with the
exercise of reason on the part of the creature repeating the word here,
then, immediately arose the idea of a nonreasoning creature capable
of speech and very naturally, a parrot, in the first instance,
suggested itself, but was superseded forthwith by a raven as equally
capable of speech, and infinitely more in keeping with the intended
tone
i had now gone so far as the conception of a raven, the bird of
illomen, monotonously repeating the one word nevermore at the
conclusion of each stanza in a poem of melancholy tone, and in length
about one hundred lines now, never losing sight of the object
supremeness or perfection at all points, i asked myselfof all
melancholy topics what, according to the universal understanding of
mankind, is the most melancholy? death, was the obvious reply and
when, i said, is this most melancholy of topics most poetical? from
what i have already explained at some length, the answer here also is
obviouswhen it most closely allies itself to beauty the death,
then, of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in
the world, and equally is it beyond doubt that the lips best suited for
such topic are those of a bereaved lover
i had now to combine the two ideas of a lover lamenting his deceased
mistress and a raven continuously repeating the word nevermore i had
to combine these, bearing in mind my design of varying at every turn the
application of the word repeated, but the only intelligible mode of
such combination is that of imagining the raven employing the word in
answer to the queries of the lover and here it was that i saw at once
the opportunity afforded for the effect on which i had been depending,
that is to say, the effect of the variation of application i saw that
i could make the first query propounded by the loverthe first query to
which the raven should reply nevermorethat i could make this first
query a commonplace one, the second less so, the third still less, and
so on, until at length the lover, startled from his original
nonchalance by the melancholy character of the word itself, by its
frequent repetition, and by a consideration of the ominous reputation of
the fowl that uttered it, is at length excited to superstition, and
wildly propounds queries of a far different characterqueries whose
solution he has passionately at heartpropounds them half in
superstition and half in that species of despair which delights in
selftorturepropounds them not altogether because he believes in the
prophetic or demoniac character of the bird which reason assures him is
merely repeating a lesson learned by rote, but because he experiences a
frenzied pleasure in so modelling his questions as to receive from the
expected nevermore the most delicious because the most intolerable
of sorrow perceiving the opportunity thus afforded me, or, more
strictly, thus forced upon me in the progress of the construction, i
first established in mind the climax or concluding querythat query to
which nevermore should be in the last place an answerthat query in
reply to which this word nevermore should involve the utmost
conceivable amount of sorrow and despair
here then the poem may be said to have its beginning, at the end where
all works of art should begin for it was here at this point of my
preconsiderations that i first put pen to paper in the composition of
the stanza
prophet, said i, thing of evil prophet still if bird or devil
by that heaven that bends above usby that god we both adore,
tell this soul with sorrow laden, if within the distant aidenn,
it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore
clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore
quoth the raven, nevermore
i composed this stanza, at this point, first that, by establishing the
climax, i might the better vary and graduate, as regards seriousness,
and importance the preceding queries of the lover, and secondly, that i
might definitely settle the rhythm, the metre, and the length and
general arrangement of the stanza, as well as graduate the stanzas which
were to precede, so that none of them might surpass this in rhythmical
effect had i been able in the subsequent composition to construct more
vigorous stanzas, i should without scruple have purposely enfeebled them
so as not to interfere with the climacteric effect
and here i may as well say a few words of the versification my first
object as usual was originality the extent to which this has been
neglected in versification is one of the most unaccountable things in
the world admitting that there is little possibility of variety in mere
rhythm, it is still clear that the possible varieties of metre and
stanza are absolutely infinite and yet, for centuries, no man, in
verse has ever done, or ever seemed to think of doing, an original
thing the fact is that originality unless in minds of very unusual
force is by no means a matter, as some suppose, of impulse or
intuition in general, to be found, it must be elaborately sought and,
although a positive merit of the highest class, demands in its
attainment less of invention than negation
of course i pretend to no originality in either the rhythm or metre of
the raven the former is trochaicthe latter is octametre
acatalectic, alternating with heptametre catalectic repeated in the
refrain of the fifth verse, and terminating with tetrametre
catalectic less pedantically, the feet employed throughout trochees
consists of a long syllable followed by a short the first line of the
stanza consists of eight of these feet, the second of seven and a half
in effect twothirds, the third of eight, the fourth of seven and a
half, the fifth the same, the sixth three and a half now, each of these
lines taken individually has been employed before, and what originality
the raven has, is in their combinations into stanzas nothing even
remotely approaching this combination has ever been attempted the
effect of this originality of combination is aided by other unusual and
some altogether novel effects, arising from an extension of the
application of the principles of rhyme and alliteration
the next point to be considered was the mode of bringing together the
lover and the ravenand the first branch of this consideration was the
locale for this the most natural suggestion might seem to be a
forest, or the fieldsbut it has always appeared to me that a close
circumscription of space is absolutely necessary to the effect of
insulated incidentit has the force of a frame to a picture it has an
indisputable moral power in keeping concentrated the attention, and, of
course, must not be confounded with mere unity of place
i determined, then, to place the lover in his chamberin a chamber
rendered sacred to him by memories of her who had frequented it the
room is represented as richly furnishedthis in mere pursuance of the
ideas i have already explained on the subject of beauty, as the sole
true poetical thesis
the locale being thus determined, i had now to introduce the birdand
the thought of introducing him through the window was inevitable the
idea of making the lover suppose, in the first instance, that the
flapping of the wings of the bird against the shutter, is a tapping at
the door, originated in a wish to increase, by prolonging, the readers
curiosity, and in a desire to admit the incidental effect arising from
the lovers throwing open the door, finding all dark, and thence
adopting the halffancy that it was the spirit of his mistress that
knocked
i made the night tempestuous, first to account for the ravens seeking
admission, and secondly, for the effect of contrast with the physical
serenity within the chamber
i made the bird alight on the bust of pallas, also for the effect of
contrast between the marble and the plumageit being understood that
the bust was absolutely suggested by the birdthe bust of pallas
being chosen, first, as most in keeping with the scholarship of the
lover, and, secondly, for the sonorousness of the word, pallas, itself
about the middle of the poem, also, i have availed myself of the force
of contrast, with a view of deepening the ultimate impression for
example, an air of the fantasticapproaching as nearly to the ludicrous
as was admissibleis given to the ravens entrance he comes in with
many a flirt and flutter
not the least obeisance made henot a moment stopped or stayed he,
but with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door
in the two stanzas which follow, the design is more obviously carried
out
then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling
by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou, i said, art sure no
craven,
ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore
tell me what thy lordly name is on the nights plutonian shore?
quoth the raven, nevermore
much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
though its answer little meaninglittle relevancy bore
for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door
bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
with such name as nevermore
the effect of the dnouement being thus provided for, i immediately drop
the fantastic for a tone of the most profound seriousnessthis tone
commencing in the stanza directly following the one last quoted, with
the line,
but the raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only, etc
from this epoch the lover no longer jestsno longer sees anything even
of the fantastic in the ravens demeanor he speaks of him as a grim,
ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore, and feels the
fiery eyes burning into his bosoms core this revolution of
thought, or fancy, on the lovers part, is intended to induce a similar
one on the part of the readerto bring the mind into a proper frame for
the dnouementwhich is now brought about as rapidly and as
directly as possible
with the dnouement properwith the ravens reply, nevermore, to
the lovers final demand if he shall meet his mistress in another
worldthe poem, in its obvious phase, that of a simple narrative, may
be said to have its completion so far, everything is within the limits
of the accountableof the real a raven having learned by rote the
single word nevermore, and having escaped from the custody of its
owner, is driven at midnight, through the violence of a storm, to seek
admission at a window from which a light still gleamsthe
chamberwindow of a student, occupied half in pouring over a volume,
half in dreaming of a beloved mistress deceased the casement being
thrown open at the fluttering of the birds wings, the bird itself
perches on the most convenient seat out of the immediate reach of the
student, who, amused by the incident and the oddity of the visitors
demeanor, demands of it, in jest and with out looking for a reply, its
name the raven addressed, answers with its customary word,
nevermorea word which finds immediate echo in the melancholy heart
of the student, who, giving utterance aloud to certain thoughts
suggested by the occasion, is again startled by the fowls repetition of
nevermore the student now guesses the state of the case, but is
impelled, as i have before explained, by the human thirst for
selftorture, and in part by superstition, to propound such queries to
the bird as will bring him, the lover, the most of the luxury of sorrow
through the anticipated answer nevermore with the indulgence, to the
extreme, of this selftorture, the narration, in what i have termed its
first or obvious phase, has a natural termination, and so far there has
been no overstepping of the limits of the real
but in subjects so handled, however skilfully, or with however vivid an
array of incident, there is always a certain hardness or nakedness which
repels the artistical eye two things are invariably requiredfirst,
some amount of complexity, or more properly, adaptation and, secondly,
some amount of suggestiveness, some undercurrent, however indefinite of
meaning it is this latter, in especial, which imparts to a work of art
so much of that richness to borrow from colloquy a forcible term
which we are too fond of confounding with the ideal it is the
excess of the suggested meaningit is the rendering this the upper
instead of the under current of themewhich turns into prose and that
of the very flattest kind the socalled poetry of the socalled
transcendentalists
holding these opinions, i added the two concluding stanzas of the
poemtheir suggestiveness being thus made to pervade all the narrative
which has preceded them the undercurrent of meaning is rendered first
apparent in the lines
take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door
quoth the raven, nevermore
it will be observed that the words, from out my heart, involve the
first metaphorical expression in the poem they, with the answer,
nevermore, dispose the mind to seek a moral in all that has been
previously narrated the reader begins now to regard the raven as
emblematicalbut it is not until the very last line of the very last
stanza, that the intention of making him emblematical of mournful and
neverending remembrance is permitted distinctly to be seen
and the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door
and his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming,
and the lamplight oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor
and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
shall be liftednevermore

old english poetry
it should not be doubted that at least onethird of the affection with
which we regard the elder poets of great britain should be attributed to
what is, in itself, a thing apart from poetrywe mean to the simple
love of the antiqueand that, again, a third of even the proper poetic
sentiment inspired by their writings, should be ascribed to a fact
which, while it has strict connection with poetry in the abstract, and
with the old british poems themselves, should not be looked upon as a
merit appertaining to the authors of the poems almost every devout
admirer of the old bards, if demanded his opinion of their productions,
would mention vaguely, yet with perfect sincerity, a sense of dreamy,
wild, indefinite, and he would perhaps say, indefinable delight on
being required to point out the source of this so shadowy pleasure, he
would be apt to speak of the quaint in phraseology and in general
handling this quaintness is, in fact, a very powerful adjunct to
ideality, but in the case in question it arises independently of the
authors will, and is altogether apart from his intention words and
their rhythm have varied verses which affect us today with a vivid
delight, and which delight, in many instances, may be traced to the one
source, quaintness, must have worn in the days of their construction a
very commonplace air this is, of course, no argument against the poems
nowwe mean it only as against the poets then there is a growing
desire to overrate them the old english muse was frank, guileless,
sincere and although very learned, still learned without art no general
error evinces a more thorough confusion of ideas than the error of
supposing donne and cowley metaphysical in the sense wherein wordsworth
and coleridge are so with the two former ethics were the endwith the
two latter the means the poet of the creation wished, by highly
artificial verse, to inculcate what he supposed to be moral truththe
poet of the ancient mariner to infuse the poetic sentiment through
channels suggested by analysis the one finished by complete failure
what he commenced in the grossest misconception the other, by a path
which could not possibly lead him astray, arrived at a triumph which is
not the less glorious because hidden from the profane eyes of the
multitude but in this view even the metaphysical verse of cowley is
but evidence of the simplicity and singleheartedness of the man and he
was in this but a type of his schoolfor we may as well designate in
this way the entire class of writers whose poems are bound up in the
volume before us, and throughout all of whom there runs a very
perceptible general character they used little art in composition
their writings sprang immediately from the souland partook intensely
of that souls nature nor is it difficult to perceive the tendency of
this abandonto elevate immeasurably all the energies of mindbut,
again, so to mingle the greatest possible fire, force, delicacy, and all
good things, with the lowest possible bathos, baldness, and imbecility,
as to render it not a matter of doubt that the average results of mind
in such a school will be found inferior to those results in one
ceteris paribus more artificial
we cannot bring ourselves to believe that the selections of the book of
gems are such as will impart to a poetical reader the clearest possible
idea of the beauty of the schoolbut if the intention had been merely
to show the schools character, the attempt might have been considered
successful in the highest degree there are long passages now before us
of the most despicable trash, with no merit whatever beyond that of
their antiquity the criticisms of the editor do not particularly please
us his enthusiasm is too general and too vivid not to be false his
opinion, for example, of sir henrys wottons verses on the queen of
bohemiathat there are few finer things in our language, is
untenable and absurd
in such lines we can perceive not one of those higher attributes of
poesy which belong to her in all circumstances and throughout all time
here everything is art, nakedly, or but awkwardly concealed no
prepossession for the mere antique and in this case we can imagine no
other prepossession should induce us to dignify with the sacred name of
poetry, a series, such as this, of elaborate and threadbare compliments,
stitched, apparently, together, without fancy, without plausibility, and
without even an attempt at adaptation
in common with all the world, we have been much delighted with the
shepherds hunting by withersa poem partaking, in a remarkable
degree, of the peculiarities of il penseroso speaking of poesy, the
author says
by the murmur of a spring,
or the least boughs rustleling,
by a daisy whose leaves spread,
shut when titan goes to bed,
or a shady bush or tree,
she could more infuse in me
than all natures beauties con
in some other wiser man
by her help i also now
make this churlish place allow
something that may sweeten gladness
in the very gall of sadness
the dull loneness, the black shade,
that these hanging vaults have made
the strange music of the waves
beating on these hollow caves,
this black den which rocks emboss,
overgrown with eldest moss,
the rude portals that give light
more to terror than delight,
this my chamber of neglect
walled about with disrespect
from all these and this dull air
a fit object for despair,
she hath taught me by her might
to draw comfort and delight
but these lines, however good, do not bear with them much of the general
character of the english antique something more of this will be found
in corbets farewell to the fairies we copy a portion of marvells
maiden lamenting for her fawn, which we prefernot only as a specimen
of the elder poets, but in itself as a beautiful poem, abounding in
pathos, exquisitely delicate imagination and truthfulnessto anything
of its species
it is a wondrous thing how fleet
twas on those little silver feet,
with what a pretty skipping grace
it oft would challenge me the race,
and whent had left me far away
twould stay, and run again, and stay
for it was nimbler much than hinds,
and trod as if on the four winds
i have a garden of my own,
but so with roses overgrown,
and lilies, that you would it guess
to be a little wilderness
and all the springtime of the year
it only loved to be there
among the beds of lilies i
have sought it oft where it should lie,
yet could not, till itself would rise,
find it, although before mine eyes
for in the flaxen lilies shade
it like a bank of lilies laid
upon the roses it would feed
until its lips even seemed to bleed,
and then to me twould boldly trip,
and print those roses on my lip,
but all its chief delight was still
with roses thus itself to fill,
and its pure virgin limbs to fold
in whitest sheets of lilies cold,
had it lived long, it would have been
lilies without, roses within

could finish enmity
nor had i time to love but since
some industry must be,
the little toil of love, i thought,
was large enough for me
xxiii
unreturning
t was such a little, little boat
that toddled down the bay
t was such a gallant, gallant sea
that beckoned it away
t was such a greedy, greedy wave
that licked it from the coast
nor ever guessed the stately sails
my little craft was lost
xxiv
whether my bark went down at sea,
whether she met with gales,
whether to isles enchanted
she bent her docile sails
by what mystic mooring
she is held today,
this is the errand of the eye
out upon the bay
xxv
belshazzar had a letter,
he never had but one
belshazzars correspondent
concluded and begun
in that immortal copy
the conscience of us all
can read without its glasses
on revelations wall
xxvi
the brain within its groove
runs evenly and true
but let a splinter swerve,
t were easier for you
to put the water back
when floods have slit the hills,
and scooped a turnpike for themselves,
and blotted out the mills
ii love
i
mine
mine by the right of the white election
mine by the royal seal
mine by the sign in the scarlet prison
bars cannot conceal
mine, here in vision and in veto
mine, by the graves repeal
titled, confirmed,  delirious charter
mine, while the ages steal
ii
bequest
you left me, sweet, two legacies,
a legacy of love
a heavenly father would content,
had he the offer of
you left me boundaries of pain
capacious as the sea,
between eternity and time,
your consciousness and me
iii
alter? when the hills do
falter? when the sun
question if his glory
be the perfect one
surfeit? when the daffodil
doth of the dew
even as herself, o friend
i will of you
iv
suspense
elysium is as far as to
the very nearest room,
if in that room a friend await
felicity or doom
what fortitude the soul contains,
that it can so endure
the accent of a coming foot,
the opening of a door
v
surrender
doubt me, my dim companion
why, god would be content
with but a fraction of the love
poured thee without a stint
the whole of me, forever,
what more the woman can,
say quick, that i may dower thee
with last delight i own
it cannot be my spirit,
for that was thine before
i ceded all of dust i knew,
what opulence the more
had i, a humble maiden,
whose farthest of degree
was that she might,
some distant heaven,
dwell timidly with thee
vi
if you were coming in the fall,
id brush the summer by
with half a smile and half a spurn,
as housewives do a fly
if i could see you in a year,
id wind the months in balls,
and put them each in separate drawers,
until their time befalls
if only centuries delayed,
id count them on my hand,
subtracting till my fingers dropped
into van diemens land
if certain, when this life was out,
that yours and mine should be,
id toss it yonder like a rind,
and taste eternity
but now, all ignorant of the length
of times uncertain wing,
it goads me, like the goblin bee,
that will not state its sting
vii
with a flower
i hide myself within my flower,
that wearing on your breast,
you, unsuspecting, wear me too
and angels know the rest
i hide myself within my flower,
that, fading from your vase,
you, unsuspecting, feel for me
almost a loneliness
viii
proof
that i did always love,
i bring thee proof
that till i loved
i did not love enough
that i shall love alway,
i offer thee
that love is life,
and life hath immortality
this, dost thou doubt, sweet?
then have i
nothing to show
but calvary
ix
have you got a brook in your little heart,
where bashful flowers blow,
and blushing birds go down to drink,
and shadows tremble so?
and nobody knows, so still it flows,
that any brook is there
and yet your little draught of life
is daily drunken there
then look out for the little brook in march,
when the rivers overflow,
and the snows come hurrying from the hills,
and the bridges often go
and later, in august it may be,
when the meadows parching lie,
beware, lest this little brook of life
some burning noon go dry
x
transplanted
as if some little arctic flower,
upon the polar hem,
went wandering down the latitudes,
until it puzzled came
to continents of summer,
to firmaments of sun,
to strange, bright crowds of flowers,
and birds of foreign tongue
i say, as if this little flower
to eden wandered in
what then? why, nothing, only,
your inference therefrom
xi
the outlet
my river runs to thee
blue sea, wilt welcome me?
my river waits reply
oh sea, look graciously
ill fetch thee brooks
from spotted nooks,
say, sea,
take me
xii
in vain
i cannot live with you,
it would be life,
and life is over there
behind the shelf
the sexton keeps the key to,
putting up
our life, his porcelain,
like a cup
discarded of the housewife,
quaint or broken
a newer sevres pleases,
old ones crack
i could not die with you,
for one must wait
to shut the others gaze down,
you could not
and i, could i stand by
and see you freeze,
without my right of frost,
deaths privilege?
nor could i rise with you,
because your face
would put out jesus,
that new grace
glow plain and foreign
on my homesick eye,
except that you, than he
shone closer by
theyd judge us  how?
for you served heaven, you know,
or sought to
i could not,
because you saturated sight,
and i had no more eyes
for sordid excellence
as paradise
and were you lost, i would be,
though my name
rang loudest
on the heavenly fame
and were you saved,
and i condemned to be
where you were not,
that self were hell to me
so we must keep apart,
you there, i here,
with just the door ajar
that oceans are,
and prayer,
and that pale sustenance,
despair
xiii
renunciation
there came a day at summers full
entirely for me
i thought that such were for the saints,
where revelations be
the sun, as common, went abroad,
the flowers, accustomed, blew,
as if no soul the solstice passed
that maketh all things new
the time was scarce profaned by speech
the symbol of a word
was needless, as at sacrament
the wardrobe of our lord
each was to each the sealed church,
permitted to commune this time,
lest we too awkward show
at supper of the lamb
the hours slid fast, as hours will,
clutched tight by greedy hands
so faces on two decks look back,
bound to opposing lands
and so, when all the time had failed,
without external sound,
each bound the others crucifix,
we gave no other bond
sufficient troth that we shall rise
deposed, at length, the grave
to that new marriage, justified
through calvaries of love
xiv
loves baptism
im ceded, ive stopped being theirs
the name they dropped upon my face
with water, in the country church,
is finished using now,
and they can put it with my dolls,
my childhood, and the string of spools
ive finished threading too
baptized before without the choice,
but this time consciously, of grace
unto supremest name,
called to my full, the crescent dropped,
existences whole arc filled up
with one small diadem
my second rank, too small the first,
crowned, crowing on my fathers breast,
a half unconscious queen
but this time, adequate, erect,
with will to choose or to reject
and i choose  just a throne
xv
resurrection
t was a long parting, but the time
for interview had come
before the judgmentseat of god,
the last and second time
these fleshless lovers met,
a heaven in a gaze,
a heaven of heavens, the privilege
of one anothers eyes
no lifetime set on them,
apparelled as the new
unborn, except they had beheld,
born everlasting now
was bridal eer like this?
a paradise, the host,
and cherubim and seraphim
the most familiar guest
xvi
apocalypse
im wife ive finished that,
that other state
im czar, im woman now
its safer so
how odd the girls life looks
behind this soft eclipse
i think that earth seems so
to those in heaven now
this being comfort, then
that other kind was pain
but why compare?
im wife stop there
xvii
the wife
she rose to his requirement, dropped
the playthings of her life
to take the honorable work
of woman and of wife
if aught she missed in her new day
of amplitude, or awe,
or first prospective, or the gold
in using wore away,
it lay unmentioned, as the sea
develops pearl and weed,
but only to himself is known
the fathoms they abide
xviii
apotheosis
come slowly, eden
lips unused to thee,
bashful, sip thy jasmines,
as the fainting bee,
reaching late his flower,
round her chamber hums,
counts his nectars  enters,
and is lost in balms
iii nature
i
new feet within my garden go,
new fingers stir the sod
a troubadour upon the elm
betrays the solitude
new children play upon the green,
new weary sleep below
and still the pensive spring returns,
and still the punctual snow
ii
mayflower
pink, small, and punctual,
aromatic, low,
covert in april,
candid in may,
dear to the moss,
known by the knoll,
next to the robin
in every human soul
bold little beauty,
bedecked with thee,
nature forswears
antiquity
iii
why?
the murmur of a bee
a witchcraft yieldeth me
if any ask me why,
t were easier to die
than tell
the red upon the hill
taketh away my will
if anybody sneer,
take care, for god is here,
thats all
the breaking of the day
addeth to my degree
if any ask me how,
artist, who drew me so,
must tell
iv
perhaps youd like to buy a flower?
but i could never sell
if you would like to borrow
until the daffodil
unties her yellow bonnet
beneath the village door,
until the bees, from clover rows
their hock and sherry draw,
why, i will lend until just then,
but not an hour more
v
the pedigree of honey
does not concern the bee
a clover, any time, to him
is aristocracy
vi
a service of song
some keep the sabbath going to church
i keep it staying at home,
with a bobolink for a chorister,
and an orchard for a dome
some keep the sabbath in surplice
i just wear my wings,
and instead of tolling the bell for church,
our little sexton sings
god preaches,  a noted clergyman,
and the sermon is never long
so instead of getting to heaven at last,
im going all along
vii
the bee is not afraid of me,
i know the butterfly
the pretty people in the woods
receive me cordially
the brooks laugh louder when i come,
the breezes madder play
wherefore, mine eyes, thy silver mists?
wherefore, o summers day?
viii
summers armies
some rainbow coming from the fair
some vision of the world cashmere
i confidently see
or else a peacocks purple train,
feather by feather, on the plain
fritters itself away
the dreamy butterflies bestir,
lethargic pools resume the whir
of last years sundered tune
from some old fortress on the sun
baronial bees march, one by one,
in murmuring platoon
the robins stand as thick today
as flakes of snow stood yesterday,
on fence and roof and twig
the orchis binds her feather on
for her old lover, don the sun,
revisiting the bog
without commander, countless, still,
the regiment of wood and hill
in bright detachment stand
behold whose multitudes are these?
the children of whose turbaned seas,
or what circassian land?
ix
the grass
the grass so little has to do,
a sphere of simple green,
with only butterflies to brood,
and bees to entertain,
and stir all day to pretty tunes
the breezes fetch along,
and hold the sunshine in its lap
and bow to everything
and thread the dews all night, like pearls,
and make itself so fine,
a duchess were too common
for such a noticing
and even when it dies, to pass
in odors so divine,
as lowly spices gone to sleep,
or amulets of pine
and then to dwell in sovereign barns,
and dream the days away,
the grass so little has to do,
i wish i were the hay
x
a little road not made of man,
enabled of the eye,
accessible to thill of bee,
or cart of butterfly
if town it have, beyond itself,
t is that i cannot say
i only sigh,  no vehicle
bears me along that way
xi
summer shower
a drop fell on the apple tree,
another on the roof
a half a dozen kissed the eaves,
and made the gables laugh
a few went out to help the brook,
that went to help the sea
myself conjectured, were they pearls,
what necklaces could be
the dust replaced in hoisted roads,
the birds jocoser sung
the sunshine threw his hat away,
the orchards spangles hung
the breezes brought dejected lutes,
and bathed them in the glee
the east put out a single flag,
and signed the fete away
xii
psalm of the day
a something in a summers day,
as slow her flambeaux burn away,
which solemnizes me
a something in a summers noon,
an azure depth, a wordless tune,
transcending ecstasy
and still within a summers night
a something so transporting bright,
i clap my hands to see
then veil my too inspecting face,
lest such a subtle, shimmering grace
flutter too far for me
the wizardfingers never rest,
the purple brook within the breast
still chafes its narrow bed
still rears the east her amber flag,
guides still the sun along the crag
his caravan of red,
like flowers that heard the tale of dews,
but never deemed the dripping prize
awaited their low brows
or bees, that thought the summers name
some rumor of delirium
no summer could for them
or arctic creature, dimly stirred
by tropic hint,  some travelled bird
imported to the wood
or winds bright signal to the ear,
making that homely and severe,
contented, known, before
the heaven unexpected came,
to lives that thought their worshipping
a too presumptuous psalm
xiii
the sea of sunset
this is the land the sunset washes,
these are the banks of the yellow sea
where it rose, or whither it rushes,
these are the western mystery
night after night her purple traffic
strews the landing with opal bales
merchantmen poise upon horizons,
dip, and vanish with fairy sails
xiv
purple clover
there is a flower that bees prefer,
and butterflies desire
to gain the purple democrat
the hummingbirds aspire
and whatsoever insect pass,
a honey bears away
proportioned to his several dearth
and her capacity
her face is rounder than the moon,
and ruddier than the gown
of orchis in the pasture,
or rhododendron worn
she doth not wait for june
before the world is green
her sturdy little countenance
against the wind is seen,
contending with the grass,
near kinsman to herself,
for privilege of sod and sun,
sweet litigants for life
and when the hills are full,
and newer fashions blow,
doth not retract a single spice
for pang of jealousy
her public is the noon,
her providence the sun,
her progress by the bee proclaimed
in sovereign, swerveless tune
the bravest of the host,
surrendering the last,
nor even of defeat aware
when cancelled by the frost
xv
the bee
like trains of cars on tracks of plush
i hear the level bee
a jar across the flowers goes,
their velvet masonry
withstands until the sweet assault
their chivalry consumes,
while he, victorious, tilts away
to vanquish other blooms
his feet are shod with gauze,
his helmet is of gold
his breast, a single onyx
with chrysoprase, inlaid
his labor is a chant,
his idleness a tune
oh, for a bees experience
of clovers and of noon
xvi
presentiment is that long shadow on the lawn
indicative that suns go down
the notice to the startled grass
that darkness is about to pass
xvii
as children bid the guest goodnight,
and then reluctant turn,
my flowers raise their pretty lips,
then put their nightgowns on
as children caper when they wake,
merry that it is morn,
my flowers from a hundred cribs
will peep, and prance again
xviii
angels in the early morning
may be seen the dews among,
stooping, plucking, smiling, flying
do the buds to them belong?
angels when the sun is hottest
may be seen the sands among,
stooping, plucking, sighing, flying
parched the flowers they bear along
xix
so bashful when i spied her,
so pretty, so ashamed
so hidden in her leaflets,
lest anybody find
so breathless till i passed her,
so helpless when i turned
and bore her, struggling, blushing,
her simple haunts beyond
for whom i robbed the dingle,
for whom betrayed the dell,
many will doubtless ask me,
but i shall never tell
xx
two worlds
it makes no difference abroad,
the seasons fit the same,
the mornings blossom into noons,
and split their pods of flame
wildflowers kindle in the woods,
the brooks brag all the day
no blackbird bates his jargoning
for passing calvary
autodafe and judgment
are nothing to the bee
his separation from his rose
to him seems misery
xxi
the mountain
the mountain sat upon the plain
in his eternal chair,
his observation omnifold,
his inquest everywhere
the seasons prayed around his knees,
like children round a sire
grandfather of the days is he,
of dawn the ancestor
xxii
a day
ill tell you how the sun rose,
a ribbon at a time
the steeples swam in amethyst,
the news like squirrels ran
the hills untied their bonnets,
the bobolinks begun
then i said softly to myself,
that must have been the sun

but how he set, i know not
there seemed a purple stile
which little yellow boys and girls
were climbing all the while
till when they reached the other side,
a dominie in gray
put gently up the evening bars,
and led the flock away
xxiii
the butterflys assumptiongown,
in chrysoprase apartments hung,
this afternoon put on
how condescending to descend,
and be of buttercups the friend
in a new england town
xxiv
the wind
of all the sounds despatched abroad,
theres not a charge to me
like that old measure in the boughs,
that phraseless melody
the wind does, working like a hand
whose fingers brush the sky,
then quiver down, with tufts of tune
permitted gods and me
when winds go round and round in bands,
and thrum upon the door,
and birds take places overhead,
to bear them orchestra,
i crave him grace, of summer boughs,
if such an outcast be,
he never heard that fleshless chant
rise solemn in the tree,
as if some caravan of sound
on deserts, in the sky,
had broken rank,
then knit, and passed
in seamless company
xxv
death and life
apparently with no surprise
to any happy flower,
the frost beheads it at its play
in accidental power
the blond assassin passes on,
the sun proceeds unmoved
to measure off another day
for an approving god
xxvi
t was later when the summer went
than when the cricket came,
and yet we knew that gentle clock
meant nought but going home
t was sooner when the cricket went
than when the winter came,
yet that pathetic pendulum
keeps esoteric time
xxvii
indian summer
these are the days when birds come back,
a very few, a bird or two,
to take a backward look
these are the days when skies put on
the old, old sophistries of june,
a blue and gold mistake
oh, fraud that cannot cheat the bee,
almost thy plausibility
induces my belief,
till ranks of seeds their witness bear,
and softly through the altered air
hurries a timid leaf
oh, sacrament of summer days,
oh, last communion in the haze,
permit a child to join,
thy sacred emblems to partake,
thy consecrated bread to break,
taste thine immortal wine
xxviii
autumn
the morns are meeker than they were,
the nuts are getting brown
the berrys cheek is plumper,
the rose is out of town
the maple wears a gayer scarf,
the field a scarlet gown
lest i should be oldfashioned,
ill put a trinket on
xxix
beclouded
the sky is low, the clouds are mean,
a travelling flake of snow
across a barn or through a rut
debates if it will go
a narrow wind complains all day
how some one treated him
nature, like us, is sometimes caught
without her diadem
xxx
the hemlock
i think the hemlock likes to stand
upon a marge of snow
it suits his own austerity,
and satisfies an awe
that men must slake in wilderness,
or in the desert cloy,
an instinct for the hoar, the bald,
laplands necessity
the hemlocks nature thrives on cold
the gnash of northern winds
is sweetest nutriment to him,
his best norwegian wines
to satin races he is nought
but children on the don
beneath his tabernacles play,
and dnieper wrestlers run
xxxi
theres a certain slant of light,
on winter afternoons,
that oppresses, like the weight
of cathedral tunes
heavenly hurt it gives us
we can find no scar,
but internal difference
where the meanings are
none may teach it anything,
t is the seal, despair,
an imperial affliction
sent us of the air
when it comes, the landscape listens,
shadows hold their breath
when it goes, t is like the distance
on the look of death
iv time and eternity
i
one dignity delays for all,
one mitred afternoon
none can avoid this purple,
none evade this crown
coach it insures, and footmen,
chamber and state and throng
bells, also, in the village,
as we ride grand along
what dignified attendants,
what service when we pause
how loyally at parting
their hundred hats they raise
how pomp surpassing ermine,
when simple you and i
present our meek escutcheon,
and claim the rank to die
ii
too late
delayed till she had ceased to know,
delayed till in its vest of snow
her loving bosom lay
an hour behind the fleeting breath,
later by just an hour than death,
oh, lagging yesterday
could she have guessed that it would be
could but a crier of the glee
have climbed the distant hill
had not the bliss so slow a pace,
who knows but this surrendered face
were undefeated still?
oh, if there may departing be
any forgot by victory
in her imperial round,
show them this meek apparelled thing,
that could not stop to be a king,
doubtful if it be crowned
iii
astra castra
departed to the judgment,
a mighty afternoon
great clouds like ushers leaning,
creation looking on
the flesh surrendered, cancelled,
the bodiless begun
two worlds, like audiences, disperse
and leave the soul alone
iv
safe in their alabaster chambers,
untouched by morning and untouched by noon,
sleep the meek members of the resurrection,
rafter of satin, and roof of stone
light laughs the breeze in her castle of sunshine
babbles the bee in a stolid ear
pipe the sweet birds in ignorant cadence,
ah, what sagacity perished here
grand go the years in the crescent above them
worlds scoop their arcs, and firmaments row,
diadems drop and doges surrender,
soundless as dots on a disk of snow
v
on this long storm the rainbow rose,
on this late morn the sun
the clouds, like listless elephants,
horizons straggled down
the birds rose smiling in their nests,
the gales indeed were done
alas how heedless were the eyes
on whom the summer shone
the quiet nonchalance of death
no daybreak can bestir
the slow archangels syllables
must awaken her
vi
from the chrysalis
my cocoon tightens, colors tease,
im feeling for the air
a dim capacity for wings
degrades the dress i wear
a power of butterfly must be
the aptitude to fly,
meadows of majesty concedes
and easy sweeps of sky
so i must baffle at the hint
and cipher at the sign,
and make much blunder, if at last
i take the clew divine
vii
setting sail
exultation is the going
of an inland soul to sea,
past the houses, past the headlands,
into deep eternity
bred as we, among the mountains,
can the sailor understand
the divine intoxication
of the first league out from land?
viii
look back on time with kindly eyes,
he doubtless did his best
how softly sinks his trembling sun
in human natures west
ix
a train went through a burial gate,
a bird broke forth and sang,
and trilled, and quivered, and shook his throat
till all the churchyard rang
and then adjusted his little notes,
and bowed and sang again
doubtless, he thought it meet of him
to say goodby to men
x
i died for beauty, but was scarce
adjusted in the tomb,
when one who died for truth was lain
in an adjoining room
he questioned softly why i failed?
for beauty, i replied
and i for truth,  the two are one
we brethren are, he said
and so, as kinsmen met a night,
we talked between the rooms,
until the moss had reached our lips,
and covered up our names
xi
troubled about many things
how many times these low feet staggered,
only the soldered mouth can tell
try can you stir the awful rivet?
try can you lift the hasps of steel?
stroke the cool forehead, hot so often,
lift, if you can, the listless hair
handle the adamantine fingers
never a thimble more shall wear
buzz the dull flies on the chamber window
brave shines the sun through the freckled pane
fearless the cobweb swings from the ceiling
indolent housewife, in daisies lain
xii
real
i like a look of agony,
because i know it s true
men do not sham convulsion,
nor simulate a throe
the eyes glaze once, and that is death
impossible to feign
the beads upon the forehead
by homely anguish strung
xiii
the funeral
that short, potential stir
that each can make but once,
that bustle so illustrious
t is almost consequence,
is the eclat of death
oh, thou unknown renown
that not a beggar would accept,
had he the power to spurn
xiv
i went to thank her,
but she slept
her bed a funnelled stone,
with nosegays at the head and foot,
that travellers had thrown,
who went to thank her
but she slept
t was short to cross the sea
to look upon her like, alive,
but turning back t was slow
xv
ive seen a dying eye
run round and round a room
in search of something, as it seemed,
then cloudier become
and then, obscure with fog,
and then be soldered down,
without disclosing what it be,
t were blessed to have seen
xvi
refuge
the clouds their backs together laid,
the north begun to push,
the forests galloped till they fell,
the lightning skipped like mice
the thunder crumbled like a stuff
how good to be safe in tombs,
where natures temper cannot reach,
nor vengeance ever comes
xvii
i never saw a moor,
i never saw the sea
yet know i how the heather looks,
and what a wave must be
i never spoke with god,
nor visited in heaven
yet certain am i of the spot
as if the chart were given
xviii
playmates
god permits industrious angels
afternoons to play
i met one,  forgot my schoolmates,
all, for him, straightway
god calls home the angels promptly
at the setting sun
i missed mine how dreary marbles,
after playing crown
xix
to know just how he suffered would be dear
to know if any human eyes were near
to whom he could intrust his wavering gaze,
until it settled firm on paradise
to know if he was patient, part content,
was dying as he thought, or different
was it a pleasant day to die,
and did the sunshine face his way?
what was his furthest mind, of home, or god,
or what the distant say
at news that he ceased human nature
on such a day?
and wishes, had he any?
just his sigh, accented,
had been legible to me
and was he confident until
ill fluttered out in everlasting well?
and if he spoke, what name was best,
what first,
what one broke off with
at the drowsiest?
was he afraid, or tranquil?
might he know
how conscious consciousness could grow,
till love that was, and love too blest to be,
meet  and the junction be eternity?
xx
the last night that she lived,
it was a common night,
except the dying this to us
made nature different
we noticed smallest things,
things overlooked before,
by this great light upon our minds
italicized, as t were
that others could exist
while she must finish quite,
a jealousy for her arose
so nearly infinite
we waited while she passed
it was a narrow time,
too jostled were our souls to speak,
at length the notice came
she mentioned, and forgot
then lightly as a reed
bent to the water, shivered scarce,
consented, and was dead
and we, we placed the hair,
and drew the head erect
and then an awful leisure was,
our faith to regulate
xxi
the first lesson
not in this world to see his face
sounds long, until i read the place
where this is said to be
but just the primer to a life
unopened, rare, upon the shelf,
clasped yet to him and me
and yet, my primer suits me so
i would not choose a book to know
than that, be sweeter wise
might some one else so learned be,
and leave me just my a b c,
himself could have the skies
xxii
the bustle in a house
the morning after death
is solemnest of industries
enacted upon earth,
the sweeping up the heart,
and putting love away
we shall not want to use again
until eternity
xxiii
i reason, earth is short,
and anguish absolute,
and many hurt
but what of that?
i reason, we could die
the best vitality
cannot excel decay
but what of that?
i reason that in heaven
somehow, it will be even,
some new equation given
but what of that?
xxiv
afraid? of whom am i afraid?
not death for who is he?
the porter of my fathers lodge
as much abasheth me
of life? t were odd i fear a thing
that comprehendeth me
in one or more existences
at deitys decree
of resurrection? is the east
afraid to trust the morn
with her fastidious forehead?
as soon impeach my crown
xxv
dying
the sun kept setting, setting still
no hue of afternoon
upon the village i perceived,
from house to house t was noon
the dusk kept dropping, dropping still
no dew upon the grass,
but only on my forehead stopped,
and wandered in my face
my feet kept drowsing, drowsing still,
my fingers were awake
yet why so little sound myself
unto my seeming make?
how well i knew the light before
i could not see it now
t is dying, i am doing but
im not afraid to know
xxvi
two swimmers wrestled on the spar
until the morning sun,
when one turned smiling to the land
o god, the other one
the stray ships passing spied a face
upon the waters borne,
with eyes in death still begging raised,
and hands beseeching thrown
xxvii
the chariot
because i could not stop for death,
he kindly stopped for me
the carriage held but just ourselves
and immortality
we slowly drove, he knew no haste,
and i had put away
my labor, and my leisure too,
for his civility
we passed the school where children played,
their lessons scarcely done
we passed the fields of gazing grain,
we passed the setting sun
we paused before a house that seemed
a swelling of the ground
the roof was scarcely visible,
the cornice but a mound
since then t is centuries but each
feels shorter than the day
i first surmised the horses heads
were toward eternity
xxviii
she went as quiet as the dew
from a familiar flower
not like the dew did she return
at the accustomed hour
she dropt as softly as a star
from out my summers eve
less skilful than leverrier
its sorer to believe
xxix
resurgam
at last to be identified
at last, the lamps upon thy side,
the rest of life to see
past midnight, past the morning star
past sunrise ah what leagues there are
between our feet and day
xxx
except to heaven, she is nought
except for angels, lone
except to some widewandering bee,
a flower superfluous blown
except for winds, provincial
except by butterflies,
unnoticed as a single dew
that on the acre lies
the smallest housewife in the grass,
yet take her from the lawn,
and somebody has lost the face
that made existence home
xxxi
death is a dialogue between
the spirit and the dust
dissolve, says death the spirit, sir,
i have another trust
death doubts it, argues from the ground
the spirit turns away,
just laying off, for evidence,
an overcoat of clay
xxxii
it was too late for man,
but early yet for god
creation impotent to help,
but prayer remained our side
how excellent the heaven,
when earth cannot be had
how hospitable, then, the face
of our old neighbor, god
xxxiii
along the potomac
when i was small, a woman died
today her only boy
went up from the potomac,
his face all victory,
to look at her how slowly
the seasons must have turned
till bullets clipt an angle,
and he passed quickly round
if pride shall be in paradise
i never can decide
of their imperial conduct,
no person testified
but proud in apparition,
that woman and her boy
pass back and forth before my brain,
as ever in the sky
xxxiv
the daisy follows soft the sun,
and when his golden walk is done,
sits shyly at his feet
he, waking, finds the flower near
wherefore, marauder, art thou here?
because, sir, love is sweet
we are the flower, thou the sun
forgive us, if as days decline,
we nearer steal to thee,
enamoured of the parting west,
the peace, the flight, the amethyst,
nights possibility
xxxv
emancipation
no rack can torture me,
my souls at liberty
behind this mortal bone
there knits a bolder one
you cannot prick with saw,
nor rend with scymitar
two bodies therefore be
bind one, and one will flee
the eagle of his nest
no easier divest
and gain the sky,
than mayest thou,
except thyself may be
thine enemy
captivity is consciousness,
sos liberty
xxxvi
lost
i lost a world the other day
has anybody found?
youll know it by the row of stars
around its forehead bound
a rich man might not notice it
yet to my frugal eye
of more esteem than ducats
oh, find it, sir, for me
xxxvii
if i shouldnt be alive
when the robins come,
give the one in red cravat
a memorial crumb
if i couldnt thank you,
being just asleep,
you will know im trying
with my granite lip
xxxviii
sleep is supposed to be,
by souls of sanity,
the shutting of the eye
sleep is the station grand
down which on either hand
the hosts of witness stand
morn is supposed to be,
by people of degree,
the breaking of the day
morning has not occurred
that shall aurora be
east of eternity
one with the banner gay,
one in the red array,
that is the break of day
xxxix
i shall know why, when time is over,
and i have ceased to wonder why
christ will explain each separate anguish
in the fair schoolroom of the sky
he will tell me what peter promised,
and i, for wonder at his woe,
i shall forget the drop of anguish
that scalds me now, that scalds me now
xl
i never lost as much but twice,
and that was in the sod
twice have i stood a beggar
before the door of god
angels, twice descending,
reimbursed my store
burglar, banker, father,
i am poor once more
poems
by emily dickinson
second series
edited by two of her friends
mabel loomis todd and tw higginson
preface
the eagerness with which the first volume of emily dickinsons
poems has been read shows very clearly that all our alleged modern
artificiality does not prevent a prompt appreciation of the
qualities of directness and simplicity in approaching the greatest
themes,life and love and death that irresistible needletouch,
as one of her best critics has called it, piercing at once the very
core of a thought, has found a response as wide and sympathetic as
it has been unexpected even to those who knew best her compelling
power  this second volume, while open to the same criticism as to
form with its predecessor, shows also the same shining beauties
although emily dickinson had been in the habit of sending
occasional poems to friends and correspondents, the full extent of
her writing was by no means imagined by them her friend hh
must at least have suspected it, for in a letter dated th
september, , she wrote
my dear friend, what portfolios full of verses
you must have it is a cruel wrong to your day and
generation that you will not give them light
if such a thing should happen as that i should outlive
you, i wish you would make me your literary legatee
and executor surely after you are what is called
dead you will be willing that the poor ghosts you
have left behind should be cheered and pleased by your
verses, will you not? you ought to be i do not think
we have a right to withhold from the world a word or
a thought any more than a deed which might help a
single soul
truly yours,
helen jackson
the portfolios were found, shortly after emily dickinsons death,
by her sister and only surviving housemate most of the poems had
been carefully copied on sheets of notepaper, and tied in little
fascicules, each of six or eight sheets while many of them bear
evidence of having been thrown off at white heat, still more had
received thoughtful revision there is the frequent addition of
rather perplexing footnotes, affording large choice of words and
phrases and in the copies which she sent to friends, sometimes one
form, sometimes another, is found to have been used without
important exception, her friends have generously placed at the
disposal of the editors any poems they had received from her and
these have given the obvious advantage of comparison among several
renderings of the same verse
to what further rigorous pruning her verses would have been
subjected had she published them herself, we cannot know they
should be regarded in many cases as merely the first strong and
suggestive sketches of an artist, intended to be embodied at some
time in the finished picture
emily dickinson appears to have written her first poems in the
winter of  in a letter to oone of the present editors the
april following, she says, i made no verse, but one or two, until
this winter
the handwriting was at first somewhat like the delicate, running
italian hand of our elder gentlewomen but as she advanced in
breadth of thought, it grew bolder and more abrupt, until in her
latest years each letter stood distinct and separate from its
fellows in most of her poems, particularly the later ones,
everything by way of punctuation was discarded, except numerous
dashes and all important words began with capitals the effect of
a page of her more recent manuscript is exceedingly quaint and
strong  the facsimile given in the present volume is from one of
the earlier transition periods although there is nowhere a date,
the handwriting makes it possible to arrange the poems with general
chronologic accuracy
as a rule, the verses were without titles but a country burial,
a thunderstorm, the hummingbird, and a few others were named
by their author, frequently at the end,sometimes only in the
accompanying note, if sent to a friend
the variation of readings, with the fact that she often wrote in
pencil and not always clearly, have at times thrown a good deal of
responsibility upon her editors but all interference not
absolutely inevitable has been avoided the very roughness of her
rendering is part of herself, and not lightly to be touched for it
seems in many cases that she intentionally avoided the smoother and
more usual rhymes
like impressionist pictures, or wagners rugged music, the very
absence of conventional form challenges attention in emily
dickinsons exacting hands, the especial, intrinsic fitness of a
particular order of words might not be sacrificed to anything
virtually extrinsic and her verses all show a strange cadence of
inner rhythmical music lines are always daringly constructed, and
the thoughtrhyme appears frequently,appealing, indeed, to an
unrecognized sense more elusive than hearing
emily dickinson scrutinized everything with cleareyed frankness
every subject was proper ground for legitimate study, even the
sombre facts of death and burial, and the unknown life beyond she
touches these themes sometimes lightly, sometimes almost
humorously, more often with weird and peculiar power but she is
never by any chance frivolous or trivial and while, as one critic
has said, she may exhibit toward god an emersonian selfpossession,
it was because she looked upon all life with a candor as unprejudiced
as it is rare
she had tried society and the world, and found them lacking  she
was not an invalid, and she lived in seclusion from no
lovedisappointment her life was the normal blossoming of a nature
introspective to a high degree, whose best thought could not exist
in pretence
storm, wind, the wild march sky, sunsets and dawns the birds and
bees, butterflies and flowers of her garden, with a few trusted
human friends, were sufficient companionship the coming of the
first robin was a jubilee beyond crowning of monarch or birthday of
pope the first red leaf hurrying through the altered air, an
epoch immortality was close about her and while never morbid or
melancholy, she lived in its presence

august, i
my nosegays are for captives
dim, longexpectant eyes,
fingers denied the plucking,
patient till paradise,
to such, if they should whisper
of morning and the moor,
they bear no other errand,
and i, no other prayer
i life
i
im nobody  who are you?
are you nobody, too?
then there s a pair of us  dont tell
they d banish us, you know
how dreary to be somebody
how public, like a frog
to tell your name the livelong day
to an admiring bog
ii
i bring an unaccustomed wine
to lips long parching, next to mine,
and summon them to drink
crackling with fever, they essay
i turn my brimming eyes away,
and come next hour to look
the hands still hug the tardy glass
the lips i would have cooled, alas
are so superfluous cold,
i would as soon attempt to warm
the bosoms where the frost has lain
ages beneath the mould
some other thirsty there may be
to whom this would have pointed me
had it remained to speak
and so i always bear the cup
if, haply, mine may be the drop
some pilgrim thirst to slake,
if, haply, any say to me,
unto the little, unto me,
when i at last awake
iii
the nearest dream recedes, unrealized
the heaven we chase
like the june bee
before the schoolboy
invites the race
stoops to an easy clover
dips  evades  teases  deploys
then to the royal clouds
lifts his light pinnace
heedless of the boy
staring, bewildered, at the mocking sky
homesick for steadfast honey,
ah the bee flies not
that brews that rare variety
iv
we play at paste,
till qualified for pearl,
then drop the paste,
and deem ourself a fool
the shapes, though, were similar,
and our new hands
learned gemtactics
practising sands
v
i found the phrase to every thought
i ever had, but one
and that defies me,  as a hand
did try to chalk the sun
to races nurtured in the dark
how would your own begin?
can blaze be done in cochineal,
or noon in mazarin?
vi
hope
hope is the thing with feathers
that perches in the soul,
and sings the tune without the words,
and never stops at all,
and sweetest in the gale is heard
and sore must be the storm
that could abash the little bird
that kept so many warm
i ve heard it in the chillest land,
and on the strangest sea
yet, never, in extremity,
it asked a crumb of me
vii
the white heat
dare you see a soul at the white heat?
then crouch within the door
red is the fires common tint
but when the vivid ore
has sated flames conditions,
its quivering substance plays
without a color but the light
of unanointed blaze
least village boasts its blacksmith,
whose anvils even din
stands symbol for the finer forge
that soundless tugs within,
refining these impatient ores
with hammer and with blaze,
until the designated light
repudiate the forge
viii
triumphant
who never lost, are unprepared
a coronet to find
who never thirsted, flagons
and cooling tamarind
who never climbed the weary league
can such a foot explore
the purple territories
on pizarros shore?
how many legions overcome?
the emperor will say
how many colors taken
on revolution day?
how many bullets bearest?
the royal scar hast thou?
angels, write promoted
on this soldiers brow
ix
the test
i can wade grief,
whole pools of it,
i m used to that
but the least push of joy
breaks up my feet,
and i tip  drunken
let no pebble smile,
t was the new liquor,
that was all
power is only pain,
stranded, through discipline,
till weights will hang
give balm to giants,
and they ll wilt, like men
give himmaleh,
they ll carry him
x
escape
i never hear the word escape
without a quicker blood,
a sudden expectation,
a flying attitude
i never hear of prisons broad
by soldiers battered down,
but i tug childish at my bars,
only to fail again
xi
compensation
for each ecstatic instant
we must an anguish pay
in keen and quivering ratio
to the ecstasy
for each beloved hour
sharp pittances of years,
bitter contested farthings
and coffers heaped with tears
xii
the martyrs
through the straight pass of suffering
the martyrs even trod,
their feet upon temptation,
their faces upon god
a stately, shriven company
convulsion playing round,
harmless as streaks of meteor
upon a planets bound
their faith the everlasting troth
their expectation fair
the needle to the north degree
wades so, through polar air
xiii
a prayer
i meant to have but modest needs,
such as content, and heaven
within my income these could lie,
and life and i keep even
but since the last included both,
it would suffice my prayer
but just for one to stipulate,
and grace would grant the pair
and so, upon this wise i prayed,
great spirit, give to me
a heaven not so large as yours,
but large enough for me
a smile suffused jehovahs face
the cherubim withdrew
grave saints stole out to look at me,
and showed their dimples, too
i left the place with all my might,
my prayer away i threw
the quiet ages picked it up,
and judgment twinkled, too,
that one so honest be extant
as take the tale for true
that whatsoever you shall ask,
itself be given you
but i, grown shrewder, scan the skies
with a suspicious air,
as children, swindled for the first,
all swindlers be, infer
xiv
the thought beneath so slight a film
is more distinctly seen,
as laces just reveal the surge,
or mists the apennine
xv
the soul unto itself
is an imperial friend,
or the most agonizing spy
an enemy could send
secure against its own,
no treason it can fear
itself its sovereign, of itself
the soul should stand in awe
xvi
surgeons must be very careful
when they take the knife
underneath their fine incisions
stirs the culprit,  life
xvii
the railway train
i like to see it lap the miles,
and lick the valleys up,
and stop to feed itself at tanks
and then, prodigious, step
around a pile of mountains,
and, supercilious, peer
in shanties by the sides of roads
and then a quarry pare
to fit its sides, and crawl between,
complaining all the while
in horrid, hooting stanza
then chase itself down hill
and neigh like boanerges
then, punctual as a star,
stop  docile and omnipotent
at its own stable door
xviii
the show
the show is not the show,
but they that go
menagerie to me
my neighbor be
fair play
both went to see
xix
delight becomes pictorial
when viewed through pain,
more fair, because impossible
that any gain
the mountain at a given distance
in amber lies
approached, the amber flits a little,
and that s the skies
xx
a thought went up my mind today
that i have had before,
but did not finish,  some way back,
i could not fix the year,
nor where it went, nor why it came
the second time to me,
nor definitely what it was,
have i the art to say
but somewhere in my soul, i know
i ve met the thing before
it just reminded me  t was all
and came my way no more
xxi
is heaven a physician?
they say that he can heal
but medicine posthumous
is unavailable
is heaven an exchequer?
they speak of what we owe
but that negotiation
i m not a party to
xxii
the return
though i get home how late, how late
so i get home, t will compensate
better will be the ecstasy
that they have done expecting me,
when, night descending, dumb and dark,
they hear my unexpected knock
transporting must the moment be,
brewed from decades of agony
to think just how the fire will burn,
just how longcheated eyes will turn
to wonder what myself will say,
and what itself will say to me,
beguiles the centuries of way
xxiii
a poor torn heart, a tattered heart,
that sat it down to rest,
nor noticed that the ebbing day
flowed silver to the west,
nor noticed night did soft descend
nor constellation burn,
intent upon the vision
of latitudes unknown
the angels, happening that way,
this dusty heart espied
tenderly took it up from toil
and carried it to god
there,  sandals for the barefoot
there,  gathered from the gales,
do the blue havens by the hand
lead the wandering sails
xxiv
too much
i should have been too glad, i see,
too lifted for the scant degree
of lifes penurious round
my little circuit would have shamed
this new circumference, have blamed
the homelier time behind
i should have been too saved, i see,
too rescued fear too dim to me
that i could spell the prayer
i knew so perfect yesterday,
that scalding one, sabachthani,
recited fluent here
earth would have been too much, i see,
and heaven not enough for me
i should have had the joy
without the fear to justify,
the palm without the calvary
so, saviour, crucify
defeat whets victory, they say
the reefs in old gethsemane
endear the shore beyond
t is beggars banquets best define
t is thirsting vitalizes wine,
faith faints to understand
xxv
shipwreck
it tossed and tossed,
a little brig i knew,
oertook by blast,
it spun and spun,
and groped delirious, for morn
it slipped and slipped,
as one that drunken stepped
its white foot tripped,
then dropped from sight
ah, brig, goodnight
to crew and you
the oceans heart too smooth, too blue,
to break for you
xxvi
victory comes late,
and is held low to freezing lips
too rapt with frost
to take it
how sweet it would have tasted,
just a drop
was god so economical?
his table s spread too high for us
unless we dine on tiptoe
crumbs fit such little mouths,
cherries suit robins
the eagles golden breakfast
strangles them
god keeps his oath to sparrows,
who of little love
know how to starve
xxvii
enough
god gave a loaf to every bird,
but just a crumb to me
i dare not eat it, though i starve,
my poignant luxury
to own it, touch it, prove the feat
that made the pellet mine,
too happy in my sparrow chance
for ampler coveting
it might be famine all around,
i could not miss an ear,
such plenty smiles upon my board,
my garner shows so fair
i wonder how the rich may feel,
an indiaman  an earl?
i deem that i with but a crumb
am sovereign of them all
xxviii
experiment to me
is every one i meet
if it contain a kernel?
the figure of a nut
presents upon a tree,
equally plausibly
but meat within is requisite,
to squirrels and to me
xxix
my countrys wardrobe
my country need not change her gown,
her triple suit as sweet
as when t was cut at lexington,
and first pronounced a fit
great britain disapproves the stars
disparagement discreet,
there s something in their attitude
that taunts her bayonet
xxx
faith is a fine invention
for gentlemen who see
but microscopes are prudent
in an emergency
xxxi
except the heaven had come so near,
so seemed to choose my door,
the distance would not haunt me so
i had not hoped before
but just to hear the grace depart
i never thought to see,
afflicts me with a double loss
t is lost, and lost to me
xxxii
portraits are to daily faces
as an evening west
to a fine, pedantic sunshine
in a satin vest
xxxiii
the duel
i took my power in my hand
and went against the world
t was not so much as david had,
but i was twice as bold
i aimed my pebble, but myself
was all the one that fell
was it goliath was too large,
or only i too small?
xxxiv
a shady friend for torrid days
is easier to find
than one of higher temperature
for frigid hour of mind
the vane a little to the east
scares muslin souls away
if broadcloth breasts are firmer
than those of organdy,
who is to blame? the weaver?
ah the bewildering thread
the tapestries of paradise
so notelessly are made
xxxv
the goal
each life converges to some centre
expressed or still
exists in every human nature
a goal,
admitted scarcely to itself, it may be,
too fair
for credibilitys temerity
to dare
adored with caution, as a brittle heaven,
to reach
were hopeless as the rainbows raiment
to touch,
yet persevered toward, surer for the distance
how high
unto the saints slow diligence
the sky
ungained, it may be, by a lifes low venture,
but then,
eternity enables the endeavoring
again
xxxvi
sight
before i got my eye put out,
i liked as well to see
as other creatures that have eyes,
and know no other way
but were it told to me, today,
that i might have the sky
for mine, i tell you that my heart
would split, for size of me
the meadows mine, the mountains mine,
all forests, stintless stars,
as much of noon as i could take
between my finite eyes
the motions of the dipping birds,
the lightnings jointed road,
for mine to look at when i liked,
the news would strike me dead
so safer, guess, with just my soul
upon the windowpane
where other creatures put their eyes,
incautious of the sun
xxxvii
talk with prudence to a beggar
of potosi and the mines
reverently to the hungry
of your viands and your wines
cautious, hint to any captive
you have passed enfranchised feet
anecdotes of air in dungeons
have sometimes proved deadly sweet
xxxviii
the preacher
he preached upon breadth till it argued him narrow,
the broad are too broad to define
and of truth until it proclaimed him a liar,
the truth never flaunted a sign
simplicity fled from his counterfeit presence
as gold the pyrites would shun
what confusion would cover the innocent jesus
to meet so enabled a man
xxxix
good night which put the candle out?
a jealous zephyr, not a doubt
ah friend, you little knew
how long at that celestial wick
the angels labored diligent
extinguished, now, for you
it might have been the lighthouse spark
some sailor, rowing in the dark,
had importuned to see
it might have been the waning lamp
that lit the drummer from the camp
to purer reveille
xl
when i hoped i feared,
since i hoped i dared
everywhere alone
as a church remain
spectre cannot harm,
serpent cannot charm
he deposes doom,
who hath suffered him
xli
deed
a deed knocks first at thought,
and then it knocks at will
that is the manufacturing spot,
and will at home and well
it then goes out an act,
or is entombed so still
that only to the ear of god
its doom is audible
xlii
times lesson
mine enemy is growing old,
i have at last revenge
the palate of the hate departs
if any would avenge,
let him be quick, the viand flits,
it is a faded meat
anger as soon as fed is dead
t is starving makes it fat
xliii
remorse
remorse is memory awake,
her companies astir,
a presence of departed acts
at window and at door
its past set down before the soul,
and lighted with a match,
perusal to facilitate
of its condensed despatch
remorse is cureless,  the disease
not even god can heal
for t is his institution,
the complement of hell
xliv
the shelter
the body grows outside,
the more convenient way,
that if the spirit like to hide,
its temple stands alway
ajar, secure, inviting
it never did betray
the soul that asked its shelter
in timid honesty
xlv
undue significance a starving man attaches
to food
far off he sighs, and therefore hopeless,
and therefore good
partaken, it relieves indeed, but proves us
that spices fly
in the receipt it was the distance
was savory
xlvi
heart not so heavy as mine,
wending late home,
as it passed my window
whistled itself a tune,
a careless snatch, a ballad,
a ditty of the street
yet to my irritated ear
an anodyne so sweet,
it was as if a bobolink,
sauntering this way,
carolled and mused and carolled,
then bubbled slow away
it was as if a chirping brook
upon a toilsome way
set bleeding feet to minuets
without the knowing why
tomorrow, night will come again,
weary, perhaps, and sore
ah, bugle, by my window,
i pray you stroll once more
xlvii
i many times thought peace had come,
when peace was far away
as wrecked men deem they sight the land
at centre of the sea,
and struggle slacker, but to prove,
as hopelessly as i,
how many the fictitious shores
before the harbor lie
xlviii
unto my books so good to turn
far ends of tired days
it half endears the abstinence,
and pain is missed in praise
as flavors cheer retarded guests
with banquetings to be,
so spices stimulate the time
till my small library
it may be wilderness without,
far feet of failing men,
but holiday excludes the night,
and it is bells within
i thank these kinsmen of the shelf
their countenances bland
enamour in prospective,
and satisfy, obtained
xlix
this merit hath the worst,
it cannot be again
when fate hath taunted last
and thrown her furthest stone,
the maimed may pause and breathe,
and glance securely round
the deer invites no longer
than it eludes the hound
l
hunger
i had been hungry all the years
my noon had come, to dine
i, trembling, drew the table near,
and touched the curious wine
t was this on tables i had seen,
when turning, hungry, lone,
i looked in windows, for the wealth
i could not hope to own
i did not know the ample bread,
t was so unlike the crumb
the birds and i had often shared
in natures diningroom
the plenty hurt me, t was so new,
myself felt ill and odd,
as berry of a mountain bush
transplanted to the road
nor was i hungry so i found
that hunger was a way
of persons outside windows,
the entering takes away
li
i gained it so,
by climbing slow,
by catching at the twigs that grow
between the bliss and me
it hung so high,
as well the sky
attempt by strategy
i said i gained it,
this was all
look, how i clutch it,
lest it fall,
and i a pauper go
unfitted by an instants grace
for the contented beggars face
i wore an hour ago
lii
to learn the transport by the pain,
as blind men learn the sun
to die of thirst, suspecting
that brooks in meadows run
to stay the homesick, homesick feet
upon a foreign shore
haunted by native lands, the while,
and blue, beloved air
this is the sovereign anguish,
this, the signal woe
these are the patient laureates
whose voices, trained below,
ascend in ceaseless carol,
inaudible, indeed,
to us, the duller scholars
of the mysterious bard
liii
returning
i years had been from home,
and now, before the door,
i dared not open, lest a face
i never saw before
stare vacant into mine
and ask my business there
my business,  just a life i left,
was such still dwelling there?
i fumbled at my nerve,
i scanned the windows near
the silence like an ocean rolled,
and broke against my ear
i laughed a wooden laugh
that i could fear a door,
who danger and the dead had faced,
but never quaked before
i fitted to the latch
my hand, with trembling care,
lest back the awful door should spring,
and leave me standing there
i moved my fingers off
as cautiously as glass,
and held my ears, and like a thief
fled gasping from the house
liv
prayer
prayer is the little implement
through which men reach
where presence is denied them
they fling their speech
by means of it in gods ear
if then he hear,
this sums the apparatus
comprised in prayer
lv
i know that he exists
somewhere, in silence
he has hid his rare life
from our gross eyes
t is an instants play,
t is a fond ambush,
just to make bliss
earn her own surprise
but should the play
prove piercing earnest,
should the glee glaze
in deaths stiff stare,
would not the fun
look too expensive?
would not the jest
have crawled too far?
lvi
melodies unheard
musicians wrestle everywhere
all day, among the crowded air,
i hear the silver strife
and  waking long before the dawn
such transport breaks upon the town
i think it that new life
it is not bird, it has no nest
nor band, in brass and scarlet dressed,
nor tambourine, nor man
it is not hymn from pulpit read,
the morning stars the treble led
on times first afternoon
some say it is the spheres at play
some say that bright majority
of vanished dames and men
some think it service in the place
where we, with late, celestial face,
please god, shall ascertain
lvii
called back
just lost when i was saved
just felt the world go by
just girt me for the onset with eternity,
when breath blew back,
and on the other side
i heard recede the disappointed tide
therefore, as one returned, i feel,
odd secrets of the line to tell
some sailor, skirting foreign shores,
some pale reporter from the awful doors
before the seal
next time, to stay
next time, the things to see
by ear unheard,
unscrutinized by eye
next time, to tarry,
while the ages steal,
slow tramp the centuries,
and the cycles wheel
ii love
i
choice
of all the souls that stand create
i have elected one
when sense from spirit files away,
and subterfuge is done
when that which is and that which was
apart, intrinsic, stand,
and this brief tragedy of flesh
is shifted like a sand
when figures show their royal front
and mists are carved away,
behold the atom i preferred
to all the lists of clay
ii
i have no life but this,
to lead it here
nor any death, but lest
dispelled from there
nor tie to earths to come,
nor action new,
except through this extent,
the realm of you
iii
your riches taught me poverty
myself a millionnaire
in little wealths,  as girls could boast,
till broad as buenos ayre,
you drifted your dominions
a different peru
and i esteemed all poverty,
for lifes estate with you
of mines i little know, myself,
but just the names of gems,
the colors of the commonest
and scarce of diadems
so much that, did i meet the queen,
her glory i should know
but this must be a different wealth,
to miss it beggars so
i m sure t is india all day
to those who look on you
without a stint, without a blame,
might i but be the jew
i m sure it is golconda,
beyond my power to deem,
to have a smile for mine each day,
how better than a gem
at least, it solaces to know
that there exists a gold,
although i prove it just in time
its distance to behold
it s far, far treasure to surmise,
and estimate the pearl
that slipped my simple fingers through
while just a girl at school
iv
the contract
i gave myself to him,
and took himself for pay
the solemn contract of a life
was ratified this way
the wealth might disappoint,
myself a poorer prove
than this great purchaser suspect,
the daily own of love
depreciate the vision
but, till the merchant buy,
still fable, in the isles of spice,
the subtle cargoes lie
at least, t is mutual risk,
some found it mutual gain
sweet debt of life,  each night to owe,
insolvent, every noon
v
the letter
going to him happy letter tell him
tell him the page i didnt write
tell him i only said the syntax,
and left the verb and the pronoun out
tell him just how the fingers hurried,
then how they waded, slow, slow, slow
and then you wished you had eyes in your pages,
so you could see what moved them so
tell him it wasnt a practised writer,
you guessed, from the way the sentence toiled
you could hear the bodice tug, behind you,
as if it held but the might of a child
you almost pitied it, you, it worked so
tell him  no, you may quibble there,
for it would split his heart to know it,
and then you and i were silenter
tell him night finished before we finished,
and the old clock kept neighing day
and you got sleepy and begged to be ended
what could it hinder so, to say?
tell him just how she sealed you, cautious,
but if he ask where you are hid
until tomorrow,  happy letter
gesture, coquette, and shake your head
vi
the way i read a letter s this
t is first i lock the door,
and push it with my fingers next,
for transport it be sure
and then i go the furthest off
to counteract a knock
then draw my little letter forth
and softly pick its lock
then, glancing narrow at the wall,
and narrow at the floor,
for firm conviction of a mouse
not exorcised before,
peruse how infinite i am
to  no one that you know
and sigh for lack of heaven,  but not
the heaven the creeds bestow
vii
wild nights wild nights
were i with thee,
wild nights should be
our luxury
futile the winds
to a heart in port,
done with the compass,
done with the chart
rowing in eden
ah the sea
might i but moor
tonight in thee
viii
at home
the night was wide, and furnished scant
with but a single star,
that often as a cloud it met
blew out itself for fear
the wind pursued the little bush,
and drove away the leaves
november left then clambered up
and fretted in the eaves
no squirrel went abroad
a dogs belated feet
like intermittent plush were heard
adown the empty street
to feel if blinds be fast,
and closer to the fire
her little rockingchair to draw,
and shiver for the poor,
the housewifes gentle task
how pleasanter, said she
unto the sofa opposite,
the sleet than may  no thee
ix
possession
did the harebell loose her girdle
to the lover bee,
would the bee the harebell hallow
much as formerly?
did the paradise, persuaded,
yield her moat of pearl,
would the eden be an eden,
or the earl an earl?
x
a charm invests a face
imperfectly beheld,
the lady dare not lift her veil
for fear it be dispelled
but peers beyond her mesh,
and wishes, and denies,
lest interview annul a want
that image satisfies
xi
the lovers
the rose did caper on her cheek,
her bodice rose and fell,
her pretty speech, like drunken men,
did stagger pitiful
her fingers fumbled at her work,
her needle would not go
what ailed so smart a little maid
it puzzled me to know,
till opposite i spied a cheek
that bore another rose
just opposite, another speech
that like the drunkard goes
a vest that, like the bodice, danced
to the immortal tune,
till those two troubled little clocks
ticked softly into one
xii
in lands i never saw, they say,
immortal alps look down,
whose bonnets touch the firmament,
whose sandals touch the town,
meek at whose everlasting feet
a myriad daisies play
which, sir, are you, and which am i,
upon an august day?
xiii
the moon is distant from the sea,
and yet with amber hands
she leads him, docile as a boy,
along appointed sands
he never misses a degree
obedient to her eye,
he comes just so far toward the town,
just so far goes away
oh, signor, thine the amber hand,
and mine the distant sea,
obedient to the least command
thine eyes impose on me
xiv
he put the belt around my life,
i heard the buckle snap,
and turned away, imperial,
my lifetime folding up
deliberate, as a duke would do
a kingdoms titledeed,
henceforth a dedicated sort,
a member of the cloud
yet not too far to come at call,
and do the little toils
that make the circuit of the rest,
and deal occasional smiles
to lives that stoop to notice mine
and kindly ask it in,
whose invitation, knew you not
for whom i must decline?
xv
the lost jewel
i held a jewel in my fingers
and went to sleep
the day was warm, and winds were prosy
i said t will keep
i woke and chid my honest fingers,
the gem was gone
and now an amethyst remembrance
is all i own
xvi
what if i say i shall not wait?
what if i burst the fleshly gate
and pass, escaped, to thee?
what if i file this mortal off,
see where it hurt me,  that s enough,
and wade in liberty?
they cannot take us any more,
dungeons may call, and guns implore
unmeaning now, to me,
as laughter was an hour ago,
or laces, or a travelling show,
or who died yesterday
iii nature
i
mother nature
nature, the gentlest mother,
impatient of no child,
the feeblest or the waywardest,
her admonition mild
in forest and the hill
by traveller is heard,
restraining rampant squirrel
or too impetuous bird
how fair her conversation,
a summer afternoon,
her household, her assembly
and when the sun goes down
her voice among the aisles
incites the timid prayer
of the minutest cricket,
the most unworthy flower
when all the children sleep
she turns as long away
as will suffice to light her lamps
then, bending from the sky
with infinite affection
and infiniter care,
her golden finger on her lip,
wills silence everywhere
ii
out of the morning
will there really be a morning?
is there such a thing as day?
could i see it from the mountains
if i were as tall as they?
has it feet like waterlilies?
has it feathers like a bird?
is it brought from famous countries
of which i have never heard?
oh, some scholar oh, some sailor
oh, some wise man from the skies
please to tell a little pilgrim
where the place called morning lies
iii
at halfpast three a single bird
unto a silent sky
propounded but a single term
of cautious melody
at halfpast four, experiment
had subjugated test,
and lo her silver principle
supplanted all the rest
at halfpast seven, element
nor implement was seen,
and place was where the presence was,
circumference between
iv
days parlor
the day came slow, till five oclock,
then sprang before the hills
like hindered rubies, or the light
a sudden musket spills
the purple could not keep the east,
the sunrise shook from fold,
like breadths of topaz, packed a night,
the lady just unrolled
the happy winds their timbrels took
the birds, in docile rows,
arranged themselves around their prince
the wind is prince of those
the orchard sparkled like a jew,
how mighty t was, to stay
a guest in this stupendous place,
the parlor of the day
v
the suns wooing
the sun just touched the morning
the morning, happy thing,
supposed that he had come to dwell,
and life would be all spring
she felt herself supremer,
a raised, ethereal thing
henceforth for her what holiday
meanwhile, her wheeling king
trailed slow along the orchards
his haughty, spangled hems,
leaving a new necessity,
the want of diadems
the morning fluttered, staggered,
felt feebly for her crown,
her unanointed forehead
henceforth her only one
vi
the robin
the robin is the one
that interrupts the morn
with hurried, few, express reports
when march is scarcely on
the robin is the one
that overflows the noon
with her cherubic quantity,
an april but begun
the robin is the one
that speechless from her nest
submits that home and certainty
and sanctity are best
vii
the butterflys day
from cocoon forth a butterfly
as lady from her door
emerged  a summer afternoon
repairing everywhere,
without design, that i could trace,
except to stray abroad
on miscellaneous enterprise
the clovers understood
her pretty parasol was seen
contracting in a field
where men made hay, then struggling hard
with an opposing cloud,
where parties, phantom as herself,
to nowhere seemed to go
in purposeless circumference,
as t were a tropic show
and notwithstanding bee that worked,
and flower that zealous blew,
this audience of idleness
disdained them, from the sky,
till sundown crept, a steady tide,
and men that made the hay,
and afternoon, and butterfly,
extinguished in its sea
viii
the bluebird
before you thought of spring,
except as a surmise,
you see, god bless his suddenness,
a fellow in the skies
of independent hues,
a little weatherworn,
inspiriting habiliments
of indigo and brown
with specimens of song,
as if for you to choose,
discretion in the interval,
with gay delays he goes
to some superior tree
without a single leaf,
and shouts for joy to nobody
but his seraphic self
ix
april
an altered look about the hills
a tyrian light the village fills
a wider sunrise in the dawn
a deeper twilight on the lawn
a print of a vermilion foot
a purple finger on the slope
a flippant fly upon the pane
a spider at his trade again
an added strut in chanticleer
a flower expected everywhere
an axe shrill singing in the woods
fernodors on untravelled roads,
all this, and more i cannot tell,
a furtive look you know as well,
and nicodemus mystery
receives its annual reply
x
the sleeping flowers
whose are the little beds, i asked,
which in the valleys lie?
some shook their heads, and others smiled,
and no one made reply
perhaps they did not hear, i said
i will inquire again
whose are the beds, the tiny beds
so thick upon the plain?
t is daisy in the shortest
a little farther on,
nearest the door to wake the first,
little leontodon
t is iris, sir, and aster,
anemone and bell,
batschia in the blanket red,
and chubby daffodil
meanwhile at many cradles
her busy foot she plied,
humming the quaintest lullaby
that ever rocked a child
hush epigea wakens
the crocus stirs her lids,
rhodoras cheek is crimson,
shes dreaming of the woods
then, turning from them, reverent,
their bedtime t is, she said
the bumblebees will wake them
when april woods are red
xi
my rose
pigmy seraphs gone astray,
velvet people from vevay,
belles from some lost summer day,
bees exclusive coterie
paris could not lay the fold
belted down with emerald
venice could not show a cheek
of a tint so lustrous meek
never such an ambuscade
as of brier and leaf displayed
for my little damask maid
i had rather wear her grace
than an earls distinguished face
i had rather dwell like her
than be duke of exeter
royalty enough for me
to subdue the bumblebee
xii
the orioles secret
to hear an oriole sing
may be a common thing,
or only a divine
it is not of the bird
who sings the same, unheard,
as unto crowd
the fashion of the ear
attireth that it hear
in dun or fair
so whether it be rune,
or whether it be none,
is of within
the tune is in the tree,
the sceptic showeth me
no, sir in thee
xiii
the oriole
one of the ones that midas touched,
who failed to touch us all,
was that confiding prodigal,
the blissful oriole
so drunk, he disavows it
with badinage divine
so dazzling, we mistake him
for an alighting mine
a pleader, a dissembler,
an epicure, a thief,
betimes an oratorio,
an ecstasy in chief
the jesuit of orchards,
he cheats as he enchants
of an entire attar
for his decamping wants
the splendor of a burmah,
the meteor of birds,
departing like a pageant
of ballads and of bards
i never thought that jason sought
for any golden fleece
but then i am a rural man,
with thoughts that make for peace
but if there were a jason,
tradition suffer me
behold his lost emolument
upon the appletree
xiv
in shadow
i dreaded that first robin so,
but he is mastered now,
and i m accustomed to him grown,
he hurts a little, though
i thought if i could only live
till that first shout got by,
not all pianos in the woods
had power to mangle me
i dared not meet the daffodils,
for fear their yellow gown
would pierce me with a fashion
so foreign to my own
i wished the grass would hurry,
so when t was time to see,
he d be too tall, the tallest one
could stretch to look at me
i could not bear the bees should come,
i wished they d stay away
in those dim countries where they go
what word had they for me?
they re here, though not a creature failed,
no blossom stayed away
in gentle deference to me,
the queen of calvary
each one salutes me as he goes,
and i my childish plumes
lift, in bereaved acknowledgment
of their unthinking drums
xv
the hummingbird
a route of evanescence
with a revolving wheel
a resonance of emerald,
a rush of cochineal
and every blossom on the bush
adjusts its tumbled head,
the mail from tunis, probably,
an easy mornings ride
xvi
secrets
the skies cant keep their secret
they tell it to the hills
the hills just tell the orchards
and they the daffodils
a bird, by chance, that goes that way
soft overheard the whole
if i should bribe the little bird,
who knows but she would tell?
i think i wont, however,
its finer not to know
if summer were an axiom,
what sorcery had snow?
so keep your secret, father
i would not, if i could,
know what the sapphire fellows do,
in your newfashioned world
xvii
who robbed the woods,
the trusting woods?
the unsuspecting trees
brought out their burrs and mosses
his fantasy to please
he scanned their trinkets, curious,
he grasped, he bore away
what will the solemn hemlock,
what will the firtree say?
xviii
two voyagers
two butterflies went out at noon
and waltzed above a stream,
then stepped straight through the firmament
and rested on a beam
and then together bore away
upon a shining sea,
though never yet, in any port,
their coming mentioned be
if spoken by the distant bird,
if met in ether sea
by frigate or by merchantman,
report was not to me
xix
by the sea
i started early, took my dog,
and visited the sea
the mermaids in the basement
came out to look at me,
and frigates in the upper floor
extended hempen hands,
presuming me to be a mouse
aground, upon the sands
but no man moved me till the tide
went past my simple shoe,
and past my apron and my belt,
and past my bodice too,
and made as he would eat me up
as wholly as a dew
upon a dandelions sleeve
and then i started too
and he  he followed close behind
i felt his silver heel
upon my ankle,  then my shoes
would overflow with pearl
until we met the solid town,
no man he seemed to know
and bowing with a mighty look
at me, the sea withdrew
xx
oldfashioned
arcturus is his other name,
id rather call him star
its so unkind of science
to go and interfere
i pull a flower from the woods,
a monster with a glass
computes the stamens in a breath,
and has her in a class
whereas i took the butterfly
aforetime in my hat,
he sits erect in cabinets,
the cloverbells forgot
what once was heaven, is zenith now
where i proposed to go
when times brief masquerade was done,
is mapped, and charted too
what if the poles should frisk about
and stand upon their heads
i hope i m ready for the worst,
whatever prank betides
perhaps the kingdom of heaven s changed
i hope the children there
wont be newfashioned when i come,
and laugh at me, and stare
i hope the father in the skies
will lift his little girl,
oldfashioned, naughty, everything,
over the stile of pearl
xxi
a tempest
an awful tempest mashed the air,
the clouds were gaunt and few
a black, as of a spectres cloak,
hid heaven and earth from view
the creatures chuckled on the roofs
and whistled in the air,
and shook their fists and gnashed their teeth
and swung their frenzied hair
the morning lit, the birds arose
the monsters faded eyes
turned slowly to his native coast,
and peace was paradise
xxii
the sea
an everywhere of silver,
with ropes of sand
to keep it from effacing
the track called land
xxiii
in the garden
a bird came down the walk
he did not know i saw
he bit an angleworm in halves
and ate the fellow, raw
and then he drank a dew
from a convenient grass,
and then hopped sidewise to the wall
to let a beetle pass
he glanced with rapid eyes
that hurried all abroad,
they looked like frightened beads, i thought
he stirred his velvet head
like one in danger cautious,
i offered him a crumb,
and he unrolled his feathers
and rowed him softer home
than oars divide the ocean,
too silver for a seam,
or butterflies, off banks of noon,
leap, plashless, as they swim
xxiv
the snake
a narrow fellow in the grass
occasionally rides
you may have met him,  did you not,
his notice sudden is
the grass divides as with a comb,
a spotted shaft is seen
and then it closes at your feet
and opens further on
he likes a boggy acre,
a floor too cool for corn
yet when a child, and barefoot,
i more than once, at morn,
have passed, i thought, a whiplash
unbraiding in the sun,
when, stooping to secure it,
it wrinkled, and was gone
several of natures people
i know, and they know me
i feel for them a transport
of cordiality
but never met this fellow,
attended or alone,
without a tighter breathing,
and zero at the bone
xxv
the mushroom
the mushroom is the elf of plants,
at evening it is not
at morning in a truffled hut
it stops upon a spot
as if it tarried always
and yet its whole career
is shorter than a snakes delay,
and fleeter than a tare
t is vegetations juggler,
the germ of alibi
doth like a bubble antedate,
and like a bubble hie
i feel as if the grass were pleased
to have it intermit
the surreptitious scion
of summers circumspect
had nature any outcast face,
could she a son contemn,
had nature an iscariot,
that mushroom,  it is him
xxvi
the storm
there came a wind like a bugle
it quivered through the grass,
and a green chill upon the heat
so ominous did pass
we barred the windows and the doors
as from an emerald ghost
the dooms electric moccason
that very instant passed
on a strange mob of panting trees,
and fences fled away,
and rivers where the houses ran
the living looked that day
the bell within the steeple wild
the flying tidings whirled
how much can come
and much can go,
and yet abide the world
xxvii
the spider
a spider sewed at night
without a light
upon an arc of white
if ruff it was of dame
or shroud of gnome,
himself, himself inform
of immortality
his strategy
was physiognomy
xxviii
i know a place where summer strives
with such a practised frost,
she each year leads her daisies back,
recording briefly, lost
but when the south wind stirs the pools
and struggles in the lanes,
her heart misgives her for her vow,
and she pours soft refrains
into the lap of adamant,
and spices, and the dew,
that stiffens quietly to quartz,
upon her amber shoe
xxix
the one that could repeat the summer day
were greater than itself, though he
minutest of mankind might be
and who could reproduce the sun,
at period of going down
the lingering and the stain, i mean
when orient has been outgrown,
and occident becomes unknown,
his name remain
xxx
the wlnds visit
the wind tapped like a tired man,
and like a host, come in,
i boldly answered entered then
my residence within
a rapid, footless guest,
to offer whom a chair
were as impossible as hand
a sofa to the air
no bone had he to bind him,
his speech was like the push
of numerous hummingbirds at once
from a superior bush
his countenance a billow,
his fingers, if he pass,
let go a music, as of tunes
blown tremulous in glass
he visited, still flitting
then, like a timid man,
again he tapped  t was flurriedly
and i became alone
xxxi
nature rarer uses yellow
than another hue
saves she all of that for sunsets,
prodigal of blue,
spending scarlet like a woman,
yellow she affords
only scantly and selectly,
like a lovers words
xxxii
gossip
the leaves, like women, interchange
sagacious confidence
somewhat of nods, and somewhat of
portentous inference,
the parties in both cases
enjoining secrecy,
inviolable compact
to notoriety
xxxiii
simplicity
how happy is the little stone
that rambles in the road alone,
and doesnt care about careers,
and exigencies never fears
whose coat of elemental brown
a passing universe put on
and independent as the sun,
associates or glows alone,
fulfilling absolute decree
in casual simplicity
xxxiv
storm
it sounded as if the streets were running,
and then the streets stood still
eclipse was all we could see at the window,
and awe was all we could feel
by and by the boldest stole out of his covert,
to see if time was there
nature was in her beryl apron,
mixing fresher air
xxxv
the rat
the rat is the concisest tenant
he pays no rent,
repudiates the obligation,
on schemes intent
balking our wit
to sound or circumvent,
hate cannot harm
a foe so reticent
neither decree
prohibits him,
lawful as
equilibrium
xxxvi
frequently the woods are pink,
frequently are brown
frequently the hills undress
behind my native town
oft a head is crested
i was wont to see,
and as oft a cranny
where it used to be
and the earth, they tell me,
on its axis turned,
wonderful rotation
by but twelve performed
xxxvii
a thunderstorm
the wind begun to rock the grass
with threatening tunes and low,
he flung a menace at the earth,
a menace at the sky
the leaves unhooked themselves from trees
and started all abroad
the dust did scoop itself like hands
and throw away the road
the wagons quickened on the streets,
the thunder hurried slow
the lightning showed a yellow beak,
and then a livid claw
the birds put up the bars to nests,
the cattle fled to barns
there came one drop of giant rain,
and then, as if the hands
that held the dams had parted hold,
the waters wrecked the sky,
but overlooked my fathers house,
just quartering a tree
xxxviii
with flowers
south winds jostle them,
bumblebees come,
hover, hesitate,
drink, and are gone
butterflies pause
on their passage cashmere
i, softly plucking,
present them here
xxxix
sunset
where ships of purple gently toss
on seas of daffodil,
fantastic sailors mingle,
and then  the wharf is still
xl
she sweeps with manycolored brooms,
and leaves the shreds behind
oh, housewife in the evening west,
come back, and dust the pond
you dropped a purple ravelling in,
you dropped an amber thread
and now you ve littered all the east
with duds of emerald
and still she plies her spotted brooms,
and still the aprons fly,
till brooms fade softly into stars
and then i come away
xli
like mighty footlights burned the red
at bases of the trees,
the far theatricals of day
exhibiting to these
t was universe that did applaud
while, chiefest of the crowd,
enabled by his royal dress,
myself distinguished god
xlii
problems
bring me the sunset in a cup,
reckon the mornings flagons up,
and say how many dew
tell me how far the morning leaps,
tell me what time the weaver sleeps
who spun the breadths of blue
write me how many notes there be
in the new robins ecstasy
among astonished boughs
how many trips the tortoise makes,
how many cups the bee partakes,
the debauchee of dews
also, who laid the rainbows piers,
also, who leads the docile spheres
by withes of supple blue?
whose fingers string the stalactite,
who counts the wampum of the night,
to see that none is due?
who built this little alban house
and shut the windows down so close
my spirit cannot see?
who ll let me out some gala day,
with implements to fly away,
passing pomposity?
xliii
the juggler of day
blazing in gold and quenching in purple,
leaping like leopards to the sky,
then at the feet of the old horizon
laying her spotted face, to die
stooping as low as the otters window,
touching the roof and tinting the barn,
kissing her bonnet to the meadow,
and the juggler of day is gone
xliv
my cricket
farther in summer than the birds,
pathetic from the grass,
a minor nation celebrates
its unobtrusive mass
no ordinance is seen,
so gradual the grace,
a pensive custom it becomes,
enlarging loneliness
antiquest felt at noon
when august, burning low,
calls forth this spectral canticle,
repose to typify
remit as yet no grace,
no furrow on the glow,
yet a druidic difference
enhances nature now
xlv
as imperceptibly as grief
the summer lapsed away,
too imperceptible, at last,
to seem like perfidy
a quietness distilled,
as twilight long begun,
or nature, spending with herself
sequestered afternoon
the dusk drew earlier in,
the morning foreign shone,
a courteous, yet harrowing grace,
as guest who would be gone
and thus, without a wing,
or service of a keel,
our summer made her light escape
into the beautiful
xlvi
it cant be summer,  that got through
it s early yet for spring
there s that long town of white to cross
before the blackbirds sing
it cant be dying,  its too rouge,
the dead shall go in white
so sunset shuts my question down
with clasps of chrysolite
xlvii
summers obsequies
the gentian weaves her fringes,
the maples loom is red
my departing blossoms
obviate parade
a brief, but patient illness,
an hour to prepare
and one, below this morning,
is where the angels are
it was a short procession,
the bobolink was there,
an aged bee addressed us,
and then we knelt in prayer
we trust that she was willing,
we ask that we may be
summer, sister, seraph,
let us go with thee
in the name of the bee
and of the butterfly
and of the breeze, amen
xlviii
fringed gentian
god made a little gentian
it tried to be a rose
and failed, and all the summer laughed
but just before the snows
there came a purple creature
that ravished all the hill
and summer hid her forehead,
and mockery was still
the frosts were her condition
the tyrian would not come
until the north evoked it
creator shall i bloom?
xlix
november
besides the autumn poets sing,
a few prosaic days
a little this side of the snow
and that side of the haze
a few incisive mornings,
a few ascetic eyes,
gone mr bryants goldenrod,
and mr thomsons sheaves
still is the bustle in the brook,
sealed are the spicy valves
mesmeric fingers softly touch
the eyes of many elves
perhaps a squirrel may remain,
my sentiments to share
grant me, o lord, a sunny mind,
thy windy will to bear
l
the snow
it sifts from leaden sieves,
it powders all the wood,
it fills with alabaster wool
the wrinkles of the road
it makes an even face
of mountain and of plain,
unbroken forehead from the east
unto the east again
it reaches to the fence,
it wraps it, rail by rail,
till it is lost in fleeces
it flings a crystal veil
on stump and stack and stem,
the summers empty room,
acres of seams where harvests were,
recordless, but for them
it ruffles wrists of posts,
as ankles of a queen,
then stills its artisans like ghosts,
denying they have been
li
the blue jay
no brigadier throughout the year
so civic as the jay
a neighbor and a warrior too,
with shrill felicity
pursuing winds that censure us
a february day,
the brother of the universe
was never blown away
the snow and he are intimate
i ve often seen them play
when heaven looked upon us all
with such severity,
i felt apology were due
to an insulted sky,
whose pompous frown was nutriment
to their temerity
the pillow of this daring head
is pungent evergreens
his larder  terse and militant
unknown, refreshing things
his character a tonic,
his future a dispute
unfair an immortality
that leaves this neighbor out
iv time and eternity
i
let down the bars, o death
the tired flocks come in
whose bleating ceases to repeat,
whose wandering is done
thine is the stillest night,
thine the securest fold
too near thou art for seeking thee,
too tender to be told
ii
going to heaven
i dont know when,
pray do not ask me how,
indeed, i m too astonished
to think of answering you
going to heaven
how dim it sounds
and yet it will be done
as sure as flocks go home at night
unto the shepherds arm
perhaps you re going too
who knows?
if you should get there first,
save just a little place for me
close to the two i lost
the smallest robe will fit me,
and just a bit of crown
for you know we do not mind our dress
when we are going home
i m glad i dont believe it,
for it would stop my breath,
and i d like to look a little more
at such a curious earth
i am glad they did believe it
whom i have never found
since the mighty autumn afternoon
i left them in the ground
iii
at least to pray is left, is left
o jesus in the air
i know not which thy chamber is,
i m knocking everywhere
thou stirrest earthquake in the south,
and maelstrom in the sea
say, jesus christ of nazareth,
hast thou no arm for me?
iv
epitaph
step lightly on this narrow spot
the broadest land that grows
is not so ample as the breast
these emerald seams enclose
step lofty for this name is told
as far as cannon dwell,
or flag subsist, or fame export
her deathless syllable
v
morns like these we parted
noons like these she rose,
fluttering first, then firmer,
to her fair repose
never did she lisp it,
and t was not for me
she was mute from transport,
i, from agony
till the evening, nearing,
one the shutters drew
quick a sharper rustling
and this linnet flew
vi
a deathblow is a lifeblow to some
who, till they died, did not alive become
who, had they lived, had died, but when
they died, vitality begun
vii
i read my sentence steadily,
reviewed it with my eyes,
to see that i made no mistake
in its extremest clause,
the date, and manner of the shame
and then the pious form
that god have mercy on the soul
the jury voted him
i made my soul familiar
with her extremity,
that at the last it should not be
a novel agony,
but she and death, acquainted,
meet tranquilly as friends,
salute and pass without a hint
and there the matter ends
viii
i have not told my garden yet,
lest that should conquer me
i have not quite the strength now
to break it to the bee
i will not name it in the street,
for shops would stare, that i,
so shy, so very ignorant,
should have the face to die
the hillsides must not know it,
where i have rambled so,
nor tell the loving forests
the day that i shall go,
nor lisp it at the table,
nor heedless by the way
hint that within the riddle
one will walk today
ix
the battlefield
they dropped like flakes, they dropped like stars,
like petals from a rose,
when suddenly across the june
a wind with fingers goes
they perished in the seamless grass,
no eye could find the place
but god on his repealless list
can summon every face
x
the only ghost i ever saw
was dressed in mechlin,  so
he wore no sandal on his foot,
and stepped like flakes of snow
his gait was soundless, like the bird,
but rapid, like the roe
his fashions quaint, mosaic,
or, haply, mistletoe
his conversation seldom,
his laughter like the breeze
that dies away in dimples
among the pensive trees
our interview was transient,
of me, himself was shy
and god forbid i look behind
since that appalling day
xi
some, too fragile for winter winds,
the thoughtful grave encloses,
tenderly tucking them in from frost
before their feet are cold
never the treasures in her nest
the cautious grave exposes,
building where schoolboy dare not look
and sportsman is not bold
this covert have all the children
early aged, and often cold,
sparrows unnoticed by the father
lambs for whom time had not a fold
xii
as by the dead we love to sit,
become so wondrous dear,
as for the lost we grapple,
though all the rest are here,
in broken mathematics
we estimate our prize,
vast, in its fading ratio,
to our penurious eyes
xiii
memorials
death sets a thing significant
the eye had hurried by,
except a perished creature
entreat us tenderly
to ponder little workmanships
in crayon or in wool,
with this was last her fingers did,
industrious until
the thimble weighed too heavy,
the stitches stopped themselves,
and then t was put among the dust
upon the closet shelves
a book i have, a friend gave,
whose pencil, here and there,
had notched the place that pleased him,
at rest his fingers are
now, when i read, i read not,
for interrupting tears
obliterate the etchings
too costly for repairs
xiv
i went to heaven,
t was a small town,
lit with a ruby,
lathed with down
stiller than the fields
at the full dew,
beautiful as pictures
no man drew
people like the moth,
of mechlin, frames,
duties of gossamer,
and eider names
almost contented
i could be
mong such unique
society
xv
their height in heaven comforts not,
their glory nought to me
t was best imperfect, as it was
i m finite, i cant see
the house of supposition,
the glimmering frontier
that skirts the acres of perhaps,
to me shows insecure
the wealth i had contented me
if t was a meaner size,
then i had counted it until
it pleased my narrow eyes
better than larger values,
however true their show
this timid life of evidence
keeps pleading, i dont know
xvi
there is a shame of nobleness
confronting sudden pelf,
a finer shame of ecstasy
convicted of itself
a best disgrace a brave man feels,
acknowledged of the brave,
one more ye blessed to be told
but this involves the grave
xvii
triumph
triumph may be of several kinds
there s triumph in the room
when that old imperator, death,
by faith is overcome
there s triumph of the finer mind
when truth, affronted long,
advances calm to her supreme,
her god her only throng
a triumph when temptations bribe
is slowly handed back,
one eye upon the heaven renounced
and one upon the rack
severer triumph, by himself
experienced, who can pass
acquitted from that naked bar,
jehovahs countenance
xviii
pompless no life can pass away
the lowliest career
to the same pageant wends its way
as that exalted here
how cordial is the mystery
the hospitable pall
a this way beckons spaciously,
a miracle for all
xix
i noticed people disappeared,
when but a little child,
supposed they visited remote,
or settled regions wild
now know i they both visited
and settled regions wild,
but did because they died,  a fact
withheld the little child
xx
following
i had no cause to be awake,
my best was gone to sleep,
and morn a new politeness took,
and failed to wake them up,
but called the others clear,
and passed their curtains by
sweet morning, when i oversleep,
knock, recollect, for me
i looked at sunrise once,
and then i looked at them,
and wishfulness in me arose
for circumstance the same
t was such an ample peace,
it could not hold a sigh,
t was sabbath with the bells divorced,
t was sunset all the day
so choosing but a gown
and taking but a prayer,
the only raiment i should need,
i struggled, and was there
xxi
if anybodys friend be dead,
it s sharpest of the theme
the thinking how they walked alive,
at such and such a time
their costume, of a sunday,
some manner of the hair,
a prank nobody knew but them,
lost, in the sepulchre
how warm they were on such a day
you almost feel the date,
so short way off it seems and now,
they re centuries from that
how pleased they were at what you said
you try to touch the smile,
and dip your fingers in the frost
when was it, can you tell,
you asked the company to tea,
acquaintance, just a few,
and chatted close with this grand thing
that dont remember you?
past bows and invitations,
past interview, and vow,
past what ourselves can estimate,
that makes the quick of woe
xxii
the journey
our journey had advanced
our feet were almost come
to that odd fork in beings road,
eternity by term
our pace took sudden awe,
our feet reluctant led
before were cities, but between,
the forest of the dead
retreat was out of hope,
behind, a sealed route,
eternitys white flag before,
and god at every gate
xxiii
a country burial
ample make this bed
make this bed with awe
in it wait till judgment break
excellent and fair
be its mattress straight,
be its pillow round
let no sunrise yellow noise
interrupt this ground
xxiv
going
on such a night, or such a night,
would anybody care
if such a little figure
slipped quiet from its chair,
so quiet, oh, how quiet
that nobody might know
but that the little figure
rocked softer, to and fro?
on such a dawn, or such a dawn,
would anybody sigh
that such a little figure
too sound asleep did lie
for chanticleer to wake it,
or stirring house below,
or giddy bird in orchard,
or early task to do?
there was a little figure plump
for every little knoll,
busy needles, and spools of thread,
and trudging feet from school
playmates, and holidays, and nuts,
and visions vast and small
strange that the feet so precious charged
should reach so small a goal
xxv
essential oils are wrung
the attar from the rose
is not expressed by suns alone,
it is the gift of screws
the general rose decays
but this, in ladys drawer,
makes summer when the lady lies
in ceaseless rosemary
xxvi
i lived on dread to those who know
the stimulus there is
in danger, other impetus
is numb and vitalless
as t were a spur upon the soul,
a fear will urge it where
to go without the spectres aid
were challenging despair
xxvii
if i should die,
and you should live,
and time should gurgle on,
and morn should beam,
and noon should burn,
as it has usual done
if birds should build as early,
and bees as bustling go,
one might depart at option
from enterprise below
t is sweet to know that stocks will stand
when we with daisies lie,
that commerce will continue,
and trades as briskly fly
it makes the parting tranquil
and keeps the soul serene,
that gentlemen so sprightly
conduct the pleasing scene
xxviii
at length
her final summer was it,
and yet we guessed it not
if tenderer industriousness
pervaded her, we thought
a further force of life
developed from within,
when death lit all the shortness up,
and made the hurry plain
we wondered at our blindness,
when nothing was to see
but her carrara guidepost,
at our stupidity,
when, duller than our dulness,
the busy darling lay,
so busy was she, finishing,
so leisurely were we
xxix
ghosts
one need not be a chamber to be haunted,
one need not be a house
the brain has corridors surpassing
material place
far safer, of a midnight meeting
external ghost,
than an interior confronting
that whiter host
far safer through an abbey gallop,
the stones achase,
than, moonless, ones own self encounter
in lonesome place
ourself, behind ourself concealed,
should startle most
assassin, hid in our apartment,
be horrors least
the prudent carries a revolver,
he bolts the door,
oerlooking a superior spectre
more near
xxx
vanished
she died,  this was the way she died
and when her breath was done,
took up her simple wardrobe
and started for the sun
her little figure at the gate
the angels must have spied,
since i could never find her
upon the mortal side
xxxi
precedence
wait till the majesty of death
invests so mean a brow
almost a powdered footman
might dare to touch it now
wait till in everlasting robes
this democrat is dressed,
then prate about preferment
and station and the rest
around this quiet courtier
obsequious angels wait
full royal is his retinue,
full purple is his state
a lord might dare to lift the hat
to such a modest clay,
since that my lord, the lord of lords
receives unblushingly
xxxii
gone
went up a year this evening
i recollect it well
amid no bells nor bravos
the bystanders will tell
cheerful, as to the village,
tranquil, as to repose,
chastened, as to the chapel,
this humble tourist rose
did not talk of returning,
alluded to no time
when, were the gales propitious,
we might look for him
was grateful for the roses
in lifes diverse bouquet,
talked softly of new species
to pick another day
beguiling thus the wonder,
the wondrous nearer drew
hands bustled at the moorings
the crowd respectful grew
ascended from our vision
to countenances new
a difference, a daisy,
is all the rest i knew
xxxiii
requiem
taken from men this morning,
carried by men today,
met by the gods with banners
who marshalled her away
one little maid from playmates,
one little mind from school,
there must be guests in eden
all the rooms are full
far as the east from even,
dim as the border star,
courtiers quaint, in kingdoms,
our departed are
xxxiv
what inn is this
where for the night
peculiar traveller comes?
who is the landlord?
where the maids?
behold, what curious rooms
no ruddy fires on the hearth,
no brimming tankards flow
necromancer, landlord,
who are these below?
xxxv
it was not death, for i stood up,
and all the dead lie down
it was not night, for all the bells
put out their tongues, for noon
it was not frost, for on my flesh
i felt siroccos crawl,
nor fire, for just my marble feet
could keep a chancel cool
and yet it tasted like them all
the figures i have seen
set orderly, for burial,
reminded me of mine,
as if my life were shaven
and fitted to a frame,
and could not breathe without a key
and t was like midnight, some,
when everything that ticked has stopped,
and space stares, all around,
or grisly frosts, first autumn morns,
repeal the beating ground
but most like chaos,  stopless, cool,
without a chance or spar,
or even a report of land
to justify despair
xxxvi
till the end
i should not dare to leave my friend,
because  because if he should die
while i was gone, and i  too late
should reach the heart that wanted me
if i should disappoint the eyes
that hunted, hunted so, to see,
and could not bear to shut until
they noticed me  they noticed me
if i should stab the patient faith
so sure i d come  so sure i d come,
it listening, listening, went to sleep
telling my tardy name,
my heart would wish it broke before,
since breaking then, since breaking then,
were useless as next mornings sun,
where midnight frosts had lain
xxxvii
void
great streets of silence led away
to neighborhoods of pause
here was no notice, no dissent,
no universe, no laws
by clocks t was morning, and for night
the bells at distance called
but epoch had no basis here,
for period exhaled
xxxviii
a throe upon the features
a hurry in the breath,
an ecstasy of parting
denominated death,
an anguish at the mention,
which, when to patience grown,
i ve known permission given
to rejoin its own
xxxix
saved
of tribulation these are they
denoted by the white
the spangled gowns, a lesser rank
of victors designate
all these did conquer but the ones
who overcame most times
wear nothing commoner than snow,
no ornament but palms
surrender is a sort unknown
on this superior soil
defeat, an outgrown anguish,
remembered as the mile
our panting ankle barely gained
when night devoured the road
but we stood whispering in the house,
and all we said was saved
xl
i think just how my shape will rise
when i shall be forgiven,
till hair and eyes and timid head
are out of sight, in heaven
i think just how my lips will weigh
with shapeless, quivering prayer
that you, so late, consider me,
the sparrow of your care
i mind me that of anguish sent,
some drifts were moved away
before my simple bosom broke,
and why not this, if they?
and so, until delirious borne
i con that thing,  forgiven,
till with long fright and longer trust
i drop my heart, unshriven
xli
the forgotten grave
after a hundred years
nobody knows the place,
agony, that enacted there,
motionless as peace
weeds triumphant ranged,
strangers strolled and spelled
at the lone orthography
of the elder dead
winds of summer fields
recollect the way,
instinct picking up the key
dropped by memory
xlii
lay this laurel on the one
too intrinsic for renown
laurel veil your deathless tree,
him you chasten, that is he
poems
by emily dickinson
third series
edited by
mabel loomis todd
its all i have to bring today,
this, and my heart beside,
this, and my heart, and all the fields,
and all the meadows wide
be sure you count, should i forget,
some one the sum could tell,
this, and my heart, and all the bees
which in the clover dwell
preface
the intellectual activity of emily dickinson was so great that
a large and characteristic choice is still possible among her
literary material, and this third volume of her verses is put
forth in response to the repeated wish of the admirers of her
peculiar genius much of emily dickinsons prose was rhythmic,
even rhymed, though frequently not set apart in lines
also many verses, written as such, were sent to friends in
letters these were published in , in the volumes of her
letters it has not been necessary, however, to include them in
this series, and all have been omitted, except three or four
exceptionally strong ones, as a book, and with flowers
there is internal evidence that many of the poems were simply
spontaneous flashes of insight, apparently unrelated to outward
circumstance others, however, had an obvious personal origin
for example, the verses i had a guinea golden, which seem to
have been sent to some friend travelling in europe, as a dainty
reminder of letterwriting delinquencies the surroundings in
which any of emily dickinsons verses are known to have been
written usually serve to explain them clearly but in general the
present volume is full of thoughts needing no interpretation to
those who apprehend this scintillating spirit
m l t
amherst, october,
i life
i
real riches
t is little i could care for pearls
who own the ample sea
or brooches, when the emperor
with rubies pelteth me
or gold, who am the prince of mines
or diamonds, when i see
a diadem to fit a dome
continual crowning me
ii
superiority to fate
superiority to fate
is difficult to learn
t is not conferred by any,
but possible to earn
a pittance at a time,
until, to her surprise,
the soul with strict economy
subsists till paradise
iii
hope
hope is a subtle glutton
he feeds upon the fair
and yet, inspected closely,
what abstinence is there
his is the halcyon table
that never seats but one,
and whatsoever is consumed
the same amounts remain
iv
forbidden fruit
i
forbidden fruit a flavor has
that lawful orchards mocks
how luscious lies the pea within
the pod that duty locks
v
forbidden fruit
ii
heaven is what i cannot reach
the apple on the tree,
provided it do hopeless hang,
that heaven is, to me
the color on the cruising cloud,
the interdicted ground
behind the hill, the house behind,
there paradise is found
vi
a word
a word is dead
when it is said,
some say
i say it just
begins to live
that day
vii
to venerate the simple days
which lead the seasons by,
needs but to remember
that from you or me
they may take the trifle
termed mortality
to invest existence with a stately air,
needs but to remember
that the acorn there
is the egg of forests
for the upper air
viii
lifes trades
its such a little thing to weep,
so short a thing to sigh
and yet by trades the size of these
we men and women die
ix
drowning is not so pitiful
as the attempt to rise
three times, t is said, a sinking man
comes up to face the skies,
and then declines forever
to that abhorred abode
where hope and he part company,
for he is grasped of god
the makers cordial visage,
however good to see,
is shunned, we must admit it,
like an adversity
x
how still the bells in steeples stand,
till, swollen with the sky,
they leap upon their silver feet
in frantic melody
xi
if the foolish call them flowers,
need the wiser tell?
if the savans classify them,
it is just as well
those who read the revelations
must not criticise
those who read the same edition
with beclouded eyes
could we stand with that old moses
canaan denied,
scan, like him, the stately landscape
on the other side,
doubtless we should deem superfluous
many sciences
not pursued by learned angels
in scholastic skies
low amid that glad belles lettres
grant that we may stand,
stars, amid profound galaxies,
at that grand right hand
xii
a syllable
could mortal lip divine
the undeveloped freight
of a delivered syllable,
t would crumble with the weight
xiii
parting
my life closed twice before its close
it yet remains to see
if immortality unveil
a third event to me,
so huge, so hopeless to conceive,
as these that twice befell
parting is all we know of heaven,
and all we need of hell
xiv
aspiration
we never know how high we are
till we are called to rise
and then, if we are true to plan,
our statures touch the skies
the heroism we recite
would be a daily thing,
did not ourselves the cubits warp
for fear to be a king
xv
the inevitable
while i was fearing it, it came,
but came with less of fear,
because that fearing it so long
had almost made it dear
there is a fitting a dismay,
a fitting a despair
tis harder knowing it is due,
than knowing it is here
the trying on the utmost,
the morning it is new,
is terribler than wearing it
a whole existence through
xvi
a book
there is no frigate like a book
to take us lands away,
nor any coursers like a page
of prancing poetry
this traverse may the poorest take
without oppress of toll
how frugal is the chariot
that bears a human soul
xvii
who has not found the heaven below
will fail of it above
gods residence is next to mine,
his furniture is love
xviii
a portrait
a face devoid of love or grace,
a hateful, hard, successful face,
a face with which a stone
would feel as thoroughly at ease
as were they old acquaintances,
first time together thrown
xix
i had a guinea golden
i had a guinea golden
i lost it in the sand,
and though the sum was simple,
and pounds were in the land,
still had it such a value
unto my frugal eye,
that when i could not find it
i sat me down to sigh
i had a crimson robin
who sang full many a day,
but when the woods were painted
he, too, did fly away
time brought me other robins,
their ballads were the same,
still for my missing troubadour
i kept the house at hame
i had a star in heaven
one pleiad was its name,
and when i was not heeding
it wandered from the same
and though the skies are crowded,
and all the night ashine,
i do not care about it,
since none of them are mine
my story has a moral
i have a missing friend,
pleiad its name, and robin,
and guinea in the sand,
and when this mournful ditty,
accompanied with tear,
shall meet the eye of traitor
in country far from here,
grant that repentance solemn
may seize upon his mind,
and he no consolation
beneath the sun may find
note  this poem may have had, like many others, a
personal origin it is more than probable that it was
sent to some friend travelling in europe, a dainty
reminder of letterwriting delinquencies
xx
saturday afternoon
from all the jails the boys and girls
ecstatically leap,
beloved, only afternoon
that prison doesnt keep
they storm the earth and stun the air,
a mob of solid bliss
alas that frowns could lie in wait
for such a foe as this
xxi
few get enough,  enough is one
to that ethereal throng
have not each one of us the right
to stealthily belong?
xxii
upon the gallows hung a wretch,
too sullied for the hell
to which the law entitled him
as natures curtain fell
the one who bore him tottered in,
for this was womans son
t was all i had, she stricken gasped
oh, what a livid boon
xxiii
the lost thought
i felt a clearing in my mind
as if my brain had split
i tried to match it, seam by seam,
but could not make them fit
the thought behind i strove to join
unto the thought before,
but sequence ravelled out of reach
like balls upon a floor
xxiv
reticence
the reticent volcano keeps
his never slumbering plan
confided are his projects pink
to no precarious man
if nature will not tell the tale
jehovah told to her,
can human nature not survive
without a listener?
admonished by her buckled lips
let every babbler be
the only secret people keep
is immortality
xxv
with flowers
if recollecting were forgetting,
then i remember not
and if forgetting, recollecting,
how near i had forgot
and if to miss were merry,
and if to mourn were gay,
how very blithe the fingers
that gathered these today
xxvi
the farthest thunder that i heard
was nearer than the sky,
and rumbles still, though torrid noons
have lain their missiles by
the lightning that preceded it
struck no one but myself,
but i would not exchange the bolt
for all the rest of life
indebtedness to oxygen
the chemist may repay,
but not the obligation
to electricity
it founds the homes and decks the days,
and every clamor bright
is but the gleam concomitant
of that waylaying light
the thought is quiet as a flake,
a crash without a sound
how lifes reverberation
its explanation found
xxvii
on the bleakness of my lot
bloom i strove to raise
late, my acre of a rock
yielded grape and maize
soil of flint if steadfast tilled
will reward the hand
seed of palm by lybian sun
fructified in sand
xxviii
contrast
a door just opened on a street
i, lost, was passing by
an instants width of warmth disclosed,
and wealth, and company
the door as sudden shut, and i,
i, lost, was passing by,
lost doubly, but by contrast most,
enlightening misery
xxix
friends
are friends delight or pain?
could bounty but remain
riches were good
but if they only stay
bolder to fly away,
riches are sad
xxx
fire
ashes denote that fire was
respect the grayest pile
for the departed creatures sake
that hovered there awhile
fire exists the first in light,
and then consolidates,
only the chemist can disclose
into what carbonates
xxxi
a man
fate slew him, but he did not drop
she felled  he did not fall
impaled him on her fiercest stakes
he neutralized them all
she stung him, sapped his firm advance,
but, when her worst was done,
and he, unmoved, regarded her,
acknowledged him a man
xxxii
ventures
finite to fail, but infinite to venture
for the one ship that struts the shore
manys the gallant, overwhelmed creature
nodding in navies nevermore
xxxiii
griefs
i measure every grief i meet
with analytic eyes
i wonder if it weighs like mine,
or has an easier size
i wonder if they bore it long,
or did it just begin?
i could not tell the date of mine,
it feels so old a pain
i wonder if it hurts to live,
and if they have to try,
and whether, could they choose between,
they would not rather die
i wonder if when years have piled
some thousands  on the cause
of early hurt, if such a lapse
could give them any pause
or would they go on aching still
through centuries above,
enlightened to a larger pain
by contrast with the love
the grieved are many, i am told
the reason deeper lies,
death is but one and comes but once,
and only nails the eyes
theres grief of want, and grief of cold,
a sort they call despair
theres banishment from native eyes,
in sight of native air
and though i may not guess the kind
correctly, yet to me
a piercing comfort it affords
in passing calvary,
to note the fashions of the cross,
of those that stand alone,
still fascinated to presume
that some are like my own
xxxiv
i have a king who does not speak
so, wondering, thro the hours meek
i trudge the day away,
half glad when it is night and sleep,
if, haply, thro a dream to peep
in parlors shut by day
and if i do, when morning comes,
it is as if a hundred drums
did round my pillow roll,
and shouts fill all my childish sky,
and bells keep saying victory
from steeples in my soul
and if i dont, the little bird
within the orchard is not heard,
and i omit to pray,
father, thy will be done today,
for my will goes the other way,
and it were perjury
xxxv
disenchantment
it dropped so low in my regard
i heard it hit the ground,
and go to pieces on the stones
at bottom of my mind
yet blamed the fate that fractured, less
than i reviled myself
for entertaining plated wares
upon my silver shelf
xxxvi
lost faith
to lose ones faith surpasses
the loss of an estate,
because estates can be
replenished,  faith cannot
inherited with life,
belief but once can be
annihilate a single clause,
and beings beggary
xxxvii
lost joy
i had a daily bliss
i half indifferent viewed,
till sudden i perceived it stir,
it grew as i pursued,
till when, around a crag,
it wasted from my sight,
enlarged beyond my utmost scope,
i learned its sweetness right
xxxviii
i worked for chaff, and earning wheat
was haughty and betrayed
what right had fields to arbitrate
in matters ratified?
i tasted wheat,  and hated chaff,
and thanked the ample friend
wisdom is more becoming viewed
at distance than at hand
xxxix
life, and death, and giants
such as these, are still
minor apparatus, hopper of the mill,
beetle at the candle,
or a fifes small fame,
maintain by accident
that they proclaim
xl
alpine glow
our lives are swiss,
so still, so cool,
till, some odd afternoon,
the alps neglect their curtains,
and we look farther on
italy stands the other side,
while, like a guard between,
the solemn alps,
the siren alps,
forever intervene
xli
remembrance
remembrance has a rear and front,
t is something like a house
it has a garret also
for refuse and the mouse,
besides, the deepest cellar
that ever mason hewed
look to it, by its fathoms
ourselves be not pursued
xlii
to hang our head ostensibly,
and subsequent to find
that such was not the posture
of our immortal mind,
affords the sly presumption
that, in so dense a fuzz,
you, too, take cobweb attitudes
upon a plane of gauze
xliii
the brain
the brain is wider than the sky,
for, put them side by side,
the one the other will include
with ease, and you beside
the brain is deeper than the sea,
for, hold them, blue to blue,
the one the other will absorb,
as sponges, buckets do
the brain is just the weight of god,
for, lift them, pound for pound,
and they will differ, if they do,
as syllable from sound
xliv
the bone that has no marrow
what ultimate for that?
it is not fit for table,
for beggar, or for cat
a bone has obligations,
a being has the same
a marrowless assembly
is culpabler than shame
but how shall finished creatures
a function fresh obtain?
old nicodemus phantom
confronting us again
xlv
the past
the past is such a curious creature,
to look her in the face
a transport may reward us,
or a disgrace
unarmed if any meet her,
i charge him, fly
her rusty ammunition
might yet reply
xlvi
to help our bleaker parts
salubrious hours are given,
which if they do not fit for earth
drill silently for heaven
xlvii
what soft, cherubic creatures
these gentlewomen are
one would as soon assault a plush
or violate a star
such dimity convictions,
a horror so refined
of freckled human nature,
of deity ashamed,
its such a common glory,
a fishermans degree
redemption, brittle lady,
be so, ashamed of thee
xlviii
desire
who never wanted,  maddest joy
remains to him unknown
the banquet of abstemiousness
surpasses that of wine
within its hope, though yet ungrasped
desires perfect goal,
no nearer, lest reality
should disenthrall thy soul
xlix
philosophy
it might be easier
to fail with land in sight,
than gain my blue peninsula
to perish of delight
l
power
you cannot put a fire out
a thing that can ignite
can go, itself, without a fan
upon the slowest night
you cannot fold a flood
and put it in a drawer,
because the winds would find it out,
and tell your cedar floor
li
a modest lot, a fame petite,
a brief campaign of sting and sweet
is plenty is enough
a sailors business is the shore,
a soldiers  balls who asketh more
must seek the neighboring life
lii
is bliss, then, such abyss
i must not put my foot amiss
for fear i spoil my shoe?
id rather suit my foot
than save my boot,
for yet to buy another pair
is possible
at any fair
but bliss is sold just once
the patent lost
none buy it any more
liii
experience
i stepped from plank to plank
so slow and cautiously
the stars about my head i felt,
about my feet the sea
i knew not but the next
would be my final inch,
this gave me that precarious gait
some call experience
liv
thanksgiving day
one day is there of the series
termed thanksgiving day,
celebrated part at table,
part in memory
neither patriarch nor pussy,
i dissect the play
seems it, to my hooded thinking,
reflex holiday
had there been no sharp subtraction
from the early sum,
not an acre or a caption
where was once a room,
not a mention, whose small pebble
wrinkled any bay,
unto such, were such assembly,
t were thanksgiving day
lv
childish griefs
softened by times consummate plush,
how sleek the woe appears
that threatened childhoods citadel
and undermined the years
bisected now by bleaker griefs,
we envy the despair
that devastated childhoods realm,
so easy to repair
ii love
i
consecration
proud of my broken heart since thou didst break it,
proud of the pain i did not feel till thee,
proud of my night since thou with moons dost slake it,
not to partake thy passion, my humility
ii
loves humility
my worthiness is all my doubt,
his merit all my fear,
contrasting which, my qualities
do lowlier appear
lest i should insufficient prove
for his beloved need,
the chiefest apprehension
within my loving creed
so i, the undivine abode
of his elect content,
conform my soul as t were a church
unto her sacrament
iii
love
love is anterior to life,
posterior to death,
initial of creation, and
the exponent of breath
iv
satisfied
one blessing had i, than the rest
so larger to my eyes
that i stopped gauging, satisfied,
for this enchanted size
it was the limit of my dream,
the focus of my prayer,
a perfect, paralyzing bliss
contented as despair
i knew no more of want or cold,
phantasms both become,
for this new value in the soul,
supremest earthly sum
the heaven below the heaven above
obscured with ruddier hue
lifes latitude leant overfull
the judgment perished, too
why joys so scantily disburse,
why paradise defer,
why floods are served to us in bowls,
i speculate no more
v
with a flower
when roses cease to bloom, dear,
and violets are done,
when bumblebees in solemn flight
have passed beyond the sun,
the hand that paused to gather
upon this summers day
will idle lie, in auburn,
then take my flower, pray
vi
song
summer for thee grant i may be
when summer days are flown
thy music still when whippoorwill
and oriole are done
for thee to bloom, ill skip the tomb
and sow my blossoms oer
pray gather me, anemone,
thy flower forevermore
vii
loyalty
split the lark and youll find the music,
bulb after bulb, in silver rolled,
scantily dealt to the summer morning,
saved for your ear when lutes be old
loose the flood, you shall find it patent,
gush after gush, reserved for you
scarlet experiment sceptic thomas,
now, do you doubt that your bird was true?
viii
to lose thee, sweeter than to gain
all other hearts i knew
t is true the drought is destitute,
but then i had the dew
the caspian has its realms of sand,
its other realm of sea
without the sterile perquisite
no caspian could be
ix
poor little heart
did they forget thee?
then dinna care then dinna care
proud little heart
did they forsake thee?
be debonair be debonair
frail little heart
i would not break thee
couldst credit me? couldst credit me?
gay little heart
like morning glory
thoull wilted be thoull wilted be
x
forgotten
there is a word
which bears a sword
can pierce an armed man
it hurls its barbed syllables,
at once is mute again
but where it fell
the saved will tell
on patriotic day,
some epauletted brother
gave his breath away
wherever runs the breathless sun,
wherever roams the day,
there is its noiseless onset,
there is its victory
behold the keenest marksman
the most accomplished shot
times sublimest target
is a soul forgot
xi
ive got an arrow here
loving the hand that sent it,
i the dart revere
fell, they will say, in skirmish
vanquished, my soul will know,
by but a simple arrow
sped by an archers bow
xii
the master
he fumbles at your spirit
as players at the keys
before they drop full music on
he stuns you by degrees,
prepares your brittle substance
for the ethereal blow,
by fainter hammers, further heard,
then nearer, then so slow
your breath has time to straighten,
your brain to bubble cool,
deals one imperial thunderbolt
that scalps your naked soul
xiii
heart, we will forget him
you and i, tonight
you may forget the warmth he gave,
i will forget the light
when you have done, pray tell me,
that i my thoughts may dim
haste lest while youre lagging,
i may remember him
xiv
father, i bring thee not myself,
that were the little load
i bring thee the imperial heart
i had not strength to hold
the heart i cherished in my own
till mine too heavy grew,
yet strangest, heavier since it went,
is it too large for you?
xv
we outgrow love like other things
and put it in the drawer,
till it an antique fashion shows
like costumes grandsires wore
xvi
not with a club the heart is broken,
nor with a stone
a whip, so small you could not see it
ive known
to lash the magic creature
till it fell,
yet that whips name too noble
then to tell
magnanimous of bird
by boy descried,
to sing unto the stone
of which it died
xvii
who?
my friend must be a bird,
because it flies
mortal my friend must be,
because it dies
barbs has it, like a bee
ah, curious friend,
thou puzzlest me
xviii
he touched me, so i live to know
that such a day, permitted so,
i groped upon his breast
it was a boundless place to me,
and silenced, as the awful sea
puts minor streams to rest
and now, im different from before,
as if i breathed superior air,
or brushed a royal gown
my feet, too, that had wandered so,
my gypsy face transfigured now
to tenderer renown
xix
dreams
let me not mar that perfect dream
by an auroral stain,
but so adjust my daily night
that it will come again
xx
numen lumen
i live with him, i see his face
i go no more away
for visitor, or sundown
deaths single privacy,
the only one forestalling mine,
and that by right that he
presents a claim invisible,
no wedlock granted me
i live with him, i hear his voice,
i stand alive today
to witness to the certainty
of immortality
taught me by time,  the lower way,
conviction every day,
that life like this is endless,
be judgment what it may
xxi
longing
i envy seas whereon he rides,
i envy spokes of wheels
of chariots that him convey,
i envy speechless hills
that gaze upon his journey
how easy all can see
what is forbidden utterly
as heaven, unto me
i envy nests of sparrows
that dot his distant eaves,
the wealthy fly upon his pane,
the happy, happy leaves
that just abroad his window
have summers leave to be,
the earrings of pizarro
could not obtain for me
i envy light that wakes him,
and bells that boldly ring
to tell him it is noon abroad,
myself his noon could bring,
yet interdict my blossom
and abrogate my bee,
lest noon in everlasting night
drop gabriel and me
xxii
wedded
a solemn thing it was, i said,
a woman white to be,
and wear, if god should count me fit,
her hallowed mystery
a timid thing to drop a life
into the purple well,
too plummetless that it come back
eternity until
iii nature
i
natures changes
the springtimes pallid landscape
will glow like bright bouquet,
though drifted deep in parian
the village lies today
the lilacs, bending many a year,
with purple load will hang
the bees will not forget the tune
their old forefathers sang
the rose will redden in the bog,
the aster on the hill
her everlasting fashion set,
and covenant gentians frill,
till summer folds her miracle
as women do their gown,
or priests adjust the symbols
when sacrament is done
ii
the tulip
she slept beneath a tree
remembered but by me
i touched her cradle mute
she recognized the foot,
put on her carmine suit,
and see
iii
a light exists in spring
not present on the year
at any other period
when march is scarcely here
a color stands abroad
on solitary hills
that science cannot overtake,
but human nature feels
it waits upon the lawn
it shows the furthest tree
upon the furthest slope we know
it almost speaks to me
then, as horizons step,
or noons report away,
without the formula of sound,
it passes, and we stay
a quality of loss
affecting our content,
as trade had suddenly encroached
upon a sacrament
iv
the waking year
a lady red upon the hill
her annual secret keeps
a lady white within the field
in placid lily sleeps
the tidy breezes with their brooms
sweep vale, and hill, and tree
prithee, my pretty housewives
who may expected be?
the neighbors do not yet suspect
the woods exchange a smile
orchard, and buttercup, and bird
in such a little while
and yet how still the landscape stands,
how nonchalant the wood,
as if the resurrection
were nothing very odd
v
to march
dear march, come in
how glad i am
i looked for you before
put down your hat
you must have walked
how out of breath you are
dear march, how are you?
and the rest?
did you leave nature well?
oh, march, come right upstairs with me,
i have so much to tell
i got your letter, and the birds
the maples never knew
that you were coming,  i declare,
how red their faces grew
but, march, forgive me
and all those hills
you left for me to hue
there was no purple suitable,
you took it all with you
who knocks? that april
lock the door
i will not be pursued
he stayed away a year, to call
when i am occupied
but trifles look so trivial
as soon as you have come,
that blame is just as dear as praise
and praise as mere as blame
vi
march
we like march, his shoes are purple,
he is new and high
makes he mud for dog and peddler,
makes he forest dry
knows the adders tongue his coming,
and begets her spot
stands the sun so close and mighty
that our minds are hot
news is he of all the others
bold it were to die
with the bluebirds buccaneering
on his british sky
vii
dawn
not knowing when the dawn will come
i open every door
or has it feathers like a bird,
or billows like a shore?
viii
a murmur in the trees to note,
not loud enough for wind
a star not far enough to seek,
nor near enough to find
a long, long yellow on the lawn,
a hubbub as of feet
not audible, as ours to us,
but dapperer, more sweet
a hurrying home of little men
to houses unperceived,
all this, and more, if i should tell,
would never be believed
of robins in the trundle bed
how many i espy
whose nightgowns could not hide the wings,
although i heard them try
but then i promised neer to tell
how could i break my word?
so go your way and ill go mine,
no fear youll miss the road
ix
morning is the place for dew,
corn is made at noon,
after dinner light for flowers,
dukes for setting sun
x
to my quick ear the leaves conferred
the bushes they were bells
i could not find a privacy
from natures sentinels
in cave if i presumed to hide,
the walls began to tell
creation seemed a mighty crack
to make me visible
xi
a rose
a sepal, petal, and a thorn
upon a common summers morn,
a flash of dew, a bee or two,
a breeze
a caper in the trees,
and im a rose
xii
high from the earth i heard a bird
he trod upon the trees
as he esteemed them trifles,
and then he spied a breeze,
and situated softly
upon a pile of wind
which in a perturbation
nature had left behind
a joyousgoing fellow
i gathered from his talk,
which both of benediction
and badinage partook,
without apparent burden,
i learned, in leafy wood
he was the faithful father
of a dependent brood
and this untoward transport
his remedy for care,
a contrast to our respites
how different we are
xiii
cobwebs
the spider as an artist
has never been employed
though his surpassing merit
is freely certified
by every broom and bridget
throughout a christian land
neglected son of genius,
i take thee by the hand
xiv
a well
what mystery pervades a well
the water lives so far,
like neighbor from another world
residing in a jar
the grass does not appear afraid
i often wonder he
can stand so close and look so bold
at what is dread to me
related somehow they may be,
the sedge stands next the sea,
where he is floorless, yet of fear
no evidence gives he
but nature is a stranger yet
the ones that cite her most
have never passed her haunted house,
nor simplified her ghost
to pity those that know her not
is helped by the regret
that those who know her, know her less
the nearer her they get
xv
to make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee,
one clover, and a bee,
and revery
the revery alone will do
if bees are few
xvi
the wind
its like the light,
a fashionless delight
its like the bee,
a dateless melody
its like the woods,
private like breeze,
phraseless, yet it stirs
the proudest trees
its like the morning,
best when its done,
the everlasting clocks
chime noon
xvii
a dew sufficed itself
and satisfied a leaf,
and felt, how vast a destiny
how trivial is life
the sun went out to work,
the day went out to play,
but not again that dew was seen
by physiognomy
whether by day abducted,
or emptied by the sun
into the sea, in passing,
eternally unknown
xviii
the woodpecker
his bill an auger is,
his head, a cap and frill
he laboreth at every tree,
a worm his utmost goal
xix
a snake
sweet is the swamp with its secrets,
until we meet a snake
t is then we sigh for houses,
and our departure take
at that enthralling gallop
that only childhood knows
a snake is summers treason,
and guile is where it goes
xx
could i but ride indefinite,
as doth the meadowbee,
and visit only where i liked,
and no man visit me,
and flirt all day with buttercups,
and marry whom i may,
and dwell a little everywhere,
or better, run away
with no police to follow,
or chase me if i do,
till i should jump peninsulas
to get away from you,
i said, but just to be a bee
upon a raft of air,
and row in nowhere all day long,
and anchor off the bar,
what liberty so captives deem
who tight in dungeons are
xxi
the moon
the moon was but a chin of gold
a night or two ago,
and now she turns her perfect face
upon the world below
her forehead is of amplest blond
her cheek like beryl stone
her eye unto the summer dew
the likest i have known
her lips of amber never part
but what must be the smile
upon her friend she could bestow
were such her silver will
and what a privilege to be
but the remotest star
for certainly her way might pass
beside your twinkling door
her bonnet is the firmament,
the universe her shoe,
the stars the trinkets at her belt,
her dimities of blue
xxii
the bat
the bat is dun with wrinkled wings
like fallow article,
and not a song pervades his lips,
or none perceptible
his small umbrella, quaintly halved,
describing in the air
an arc alike inscrutable,
elate philosopher
deputed from what firmament
of what astute abode,
empowered with what malevolence
auspiciously withheld
to his adroit creator
ascribe no less the praise
beneficent, believe me,
his eccentricities
xxiii
the balloon
youve seen balloons set, havent you?
so stately they ascend
it is as swans discarded you
for duties diamond
their liquid feet go softly out
upon a sea of blond
they spurn the air as t were too mean
for creatures so renowned
their ribbons just beyond the eye,
they struggle some for breath,
and yet the crowd applauds below
they would not encore death
the gilded creature strains and spins,
trips frantic in a tree,
tears open her imperial veins
and tumbles in the sea
the crowd retire with an oath
the dust in streets goes down,
and clerks in countingrooms observe,
t was only a balloon
xxiv
evening
the cricket sang,
and set the sun,
and workmen finished, one by one,
their seam the day upon
the low grass loaded with the dew,
the twilight stood as strangers do
with hat in hand, polite and new,
to stay as if, or go
a vastness, as a neighbor, came,
a wisdom without face or name,
a peace, as hemispheres at home,
and so the night became
xxv
cocoon
drab habitation of whom?
tabernacle or tomb,
or dome of worm,
or porch of gnome,
or some elfs catacomb?
xxvi
sunset
a sloop of amber slips away
upon an ether sea,
and wrecks in peace a purple tar,
the son of ecstasy
xxvii
aurora
of bronze and blaze
the north, tonight
so adequate its forms,
so preconcerted with itself,
so distant to alarms,
an unconcern so sovereign
to universe, or me,
it paints my simple spirit
with tints of majesty,
till i take vaster attitudes,
and strut upon my stem,
disdaining men and oxygen,
for arrogance of them
my splendors are menagerie
but their competeless show
will entertain the centuries
when i am, long ago,
an island in dishonored grass,
whom none but daisies know
xxviii
the coming of night
how the old mountains drip with sunset,
and the brake of dun
how the hemlocks are tipped in tinsel
by the wizard sun
how the old steeples hand the scarlet,
till the ball is full,
have i the lip of the flamingo
that i dare to tell?
then, how the fire ebbs like billows,
touching all the grass
with a departing, sapphire feature,
as if a duchess pass
how a small dusk crawls on the village
till the houses blot
and the odd flambeaux no men carry
glimmer on the spot
now it is night in nest and kennel,
and where was the wood,
just a dome of abyss is nodding
into solitude
these are the visions baffled guido
titian never told
domenichino dropped the pencil,
powerless to unfold
xxix
aftermath
the murmuring of bees has ceased
but murmuring of some
posterior, prophetic,
has simultaneous come,
the lower metres of the year,
when natures laugh is done,
the revelations of the book
whose genesis is june
iv time and eternity
i
this world is not conclusion
a sequel stands beyond,
invisible, as music,
but positive, as sound
it beckons and it baffles
philosophies dont know,
and through a riddle, at the last,
sagacity must go
to guess it puzzles scholars
to gain it, men have shown
contempt of generations,
and crucifixion known
ii
we learn in the retreating
how vast an one
was recently among us
a perished sun
endears in the departure
how doubly more
than all the golden presence
it was before
iii
they say that time assuages,
time never did assuage
an actual suffering strengthens,
as sinews do, with age
time is a test of trouble,
but not a remedy
if such it prove, it prove too
there was no malady
iv
we cover thee, sweet face
not that we tire of thee,
but that thyself fatigue of us
remember, as thou flee,
we follow thee until
thou notice us no more,
and then, reluctant, turn away
to con thee oer and oer,
and blame the scanty love
we were content to show,
augmented, sweet, a hundred fold
if thou wouldst take it now
v
ending
that is solemn we have ended,
be it but a play,
or a glee among the garrets,
or a holiday,
or a leaving home or later,
parting with a world
we have understood, for better
still it be unfurled
vi
the stimulus, beyond the grave
his countenance to see,
supports me like imperial drams
afforded royally
vii
given in marriage unto thee,
oh, thou celestial host
bride of the father and the son,
bride of the holy ghost
other betrothal shall dissolve,
wedlock of will decay
only the keeper of this seal
conquers mortality
viii
that such have died enables us
the tranquiller to die
that such have lived, certificate
for immortality
ix
they wont frown always,  some sweet day
when i forget to tease,
theyll recollect how cold i looked,
and how i just said please
then they will hasten to the door
to call the little child,
who cannot thank them, for the ice
that on her lisping piled
x
immortality
it is an honorable thought,
and makes one lift ones hat,
as one encountered gentlefolk
upon a daily street,
that weve immortal place,
though pyramids decay,
and kingdoms, like the orchard,
flit russetly away
xi
the distance that the dead have gone
does not at first appear
their coming back seems possible
for many an ardent year
and then, that we have followed them
we more than half suspect,
so intimate have we become
with their dear retrospect
xii
how dare the robins sing,
when men and women hear
who since they went to their account
have settled with the year
paid all that life had earned
in one consummate bill,
and now, what life or death can do
is immaterial
insulting is the sun
to him whose mortal light,
beguiled of immortality,
bequeaths him to the night
in deference to him
extinct be every hum,
whose garden wrestles with the dew,
at daybreak overcome
xiii
death
death is like the insect
menacing the tree,
competent to kill it,
but decoyed may be
bait it with the balsam,
seek it with the knife,
baffle, if it cost you
everything in life
then, if it have burrowed
out of reach of skill,
ring the tree and leave it,
t is the vermins will
xiv
unwarned
t is sunrise, little maid, hast thou
no station in the day?
t was not thy wont to hinder so,
retrieve thine industry
t is noon, my little maid, alas
and art thou sleeping yet?
the lily waiting to be wed,
the bee, dost thou forget?
my little maid, t is night alas,
that night should be to thee
instead of morning hadst thou broached
thy little plan to me,
dissuade thee if i could not, sweet,
i might have aided thee
xv
each that we lose takes part of us
a crescent still abides,
which like the moon, some turbid night,
is summoned by the tides
xvi
not any higher stands the grave
for heroes than for men
not any nearer for the child
than numb threescore and ten
this latest leisure equal lulls
the beggar and his queen
propitiate this democrat
by summers gracious mien
xvii
asleep
as far from pity as complaint,
as cool to speech as stone,
as numb to revelation
as if my trade were bone
as far from time as history,
as near yourself today
as children to the rainbows scarf,
or sunsets yellow play
to eyelids in the sepulchre
how still the dancer lies,
while colors revelations break,
and blaze the butterflies
xviii
the spirit
t is whiter than an indian pipe,
t is dimmer than a lace
no stature has it, like a fog,
when you approach the place
not any voice denotes it here,
or intimates it there
a spirit, how doth it accost?
what customs hath the air?
this limitless hyperbole
each one of us shall be
t is drama, if hypothesis
it be not tragedy
xix
the monument
she laid her docile crescent down,
and this mechanic stone
still states, to dates that have forgot,
the news that she is gone
so constant to its stolid trust,
the shaft that never knew,
it shames the constancy that fled
before its emblem flew
xx
bless god, he went as soldiers,
his musket on his breast
grant, god, he charge the bravest
of all the martial blest
please god, might i behold him
in epauletted white,
i should not fear the foe then,
i should not fear the fight
xxi
immortal is an ample word
when what we need is by,
but when it leaves us for a time,
t is a necessity
of heaven above the firmest proof
we fundamental know,
except for its marauding hand,
it had been heaven below
xxii
where every bird is bold to go,
and bees abashless play,
the foreigner before he knocks
must thrust the tears away
xxiii
the grave my little cottage is,
where, keeping house for thee,
i make my parlor orderly,
and lay the marble tea,
for two divided, briefly,
a cycle, it may be,
till everlasting life unite
in strong society
xxiv
this was in the white of the year,
that was in the green,
drifts were as difficult then to think
as daisies now to be seen
looking back is best that is left,
or if it be before,
retrospection is prospects half,
sometimes almost more
xxv
sweet hours have perished here
this is a mighty room
within its precincts hopes have played,
now shadows in the tomb
xxvi
me come my dazzled face
in such a shining place
me hear my foreign ear
the sounds of welcome near
the saints shall meet
our bashful feet
my holiday shall be
that they remember me
my paradise, the fame
that they pronounce my name
xxvii
invisible
from us she wandered now a year,
her tarrying unknown
if wilderness prevent her feet,
or that ethereal zone
no eye hath seen and lived,
we ignorant must be
we only know what time of year
we took the mystery
xxviii
i wish i knew that womans name,
so, when she comes this way,
to hold my life, and hold my ears,
for fear i hear her say
shes sorry i am dead, again,
just when the grave and i
have sobbed ourselves almost to sleep,
our only lullaby
xxix
trying to forget
bereaved of all, i went abroad,
no less bereaved to be
upon a new peninsula,
the grave preceded me,
obtained my lodgings ere myself,
and when i sought my bed,
the grave it was, reposed upon
the pillow for my head
i waked, to find it first awake,
i rose,  it followed me
i tried to drop it in the crowd,
to lose it in the sea,
in cups of artificial drowse
to sleep its shape away,
the grave was finished, but the spade
remained in memory
xxx
i felt a funeral in my brain,
and mourners, to and fro,
kept treading, treading, till it seemed
that sense was breaking through
and when they all were seated,
a service like a drum
kept beating, beating, till i thought
my mind was going numb
and then i heard them lift a box,
and creak across my soul
with those same boots of lead, again
then space began to toll
as all the heavens were a bell,
and being but an ear,
and i and silence some strange race,
wrecked, solitary, here
xxxi
i meant to find her when i came
death had the same design
but the success was his, it seems,
and the discomfit mine
i meant to tell her how i longed
for just this single time
but death had told her so the first,
and she had hearkened him
to wander now is my abode
to rest,  to rest would be
a privilege of hurricane
to memory and me
xxxii
waiting
i sing to use the waiting,
my bonnet but to tie,
and shut the door unto my house
no more to do have i,
till, his best step approaching,
we journey to the day,
and tell each other how we sang
to keep the dark away
xxxiii
a sickness of this world it most occasions
when best men die
a wishfulness their far condition
to occupy
a chief indifference, as foreign
a world must be
themselves forsake contented,
for deity
xxxiv
superfluous were the sun
when excellence is dead
he were superfluous every day,
for every day is said
that syllable whose faith
just saves it from despair,
and whose ill meet you hesitates
if love inquire, where?
upon his dateless fame
our periods may lie,
as stars that drop anonymous
from an abundant sky
xxxv
so proud she was to die
it made us all ashamed
that what we cherished, so unknown
to her desire seemed
so satisfied to go
where none of us should be,
immediately, that anguish stooped
almost to jealousy
xxxvi
farewell
tie the strings to my life, my lord,
then i am ready to go
just a look at the horses
rapid that will do
put me in on the firmest side,
so i shall never fall
for we must ride to the judgment,
and its partly down hill
but never i mind the bridges,
and never i mind the sea
held fast in everlasting race
by my own choice and thee
goodby to the life i used to live,
and the world i used to know
and kiss the hills for me, just once
now i am ready to go
xxxvii
the dying need but little, dear,
a glass of waters all,
a flowers unobtrusive face
to punctuate the wall,
a fan, perhaps, a friends regret,
and certainly that one
no color in the rainbow
perceives when you are gone
xxxviii
dead
theres something quieter than sleep
within this inner room
it wears a sprig upon its breast,
and will not tell its name
some touch it and some kiss it,
some chafe its idle hand
it has a simple gravity
i do not understand
while simplehearted neighbors
chat of the early dead,
we, prone to periphrasis,
remark that birds have fled
xxxix
the soul should always stand ajar,
that if the heaven inquire,
he will not be obliged to wait,
or shy of troubling her
depart, before the host has slid
the bolt upon the door,
to seek for the accomplished guest,
her visitor no more
xl
three weeks passed since i had seen her,
some disease had vexed
t was with text and village singing
i beheld her next,
and a company  our pleasure
to discourse alone
gracious now to me as any,
gracious unto none
borne, without dissent of either,
to the parish night
of the separated people
which are out of sight?
xli
i breathed enough to learn the trick,
and now, removed from air,
i simulate the breath so well,
that one, to be quite sure
the lungs are stirless, must descend
among the cunning cells,
and touch the pantomime himself
how cool the bellows feels
xlii
i wonder if the sepulchre
is not a lonesome way,
when men and boys, and larks and june
go down the fields to hay
xliii
joy in death
if tolling bell i ask the cause
a soul has gone to god,
im answered in a lonesome tone
is heaven then so sad?
that bells should joyful ring to tell
a soul had gone to heaven,
would seem to me the proper way
a good news should be given
xliv
if i may have it when its dead
i will contented be
if just as soon as breath is out
it shall belong to me,
until they lock it in the grave,
t is bliss i cannot weigh,
for though they lock thee in the grave,
myself can hold the key
think of it, lover i and thee
permitted face to face to be
after a life, a death well say,
for death was that, and this is thee
xlv
before the ice is in the pools,
before the skaters go,
or any cheek at nightfall
is tarnished by the snow,
before the fields have finished,
before the christmas tree,
wonder upon wonder
will arrive to me
what we touch the hems of
on a summers day
what is only walking
just a bridge away
that which sings so, speaks so,
when theres no one here,
will the frock i wept in
answer me to wear?
xlvi
dying
i heard a fly buzz when i died
the stillness round my form
was like the stillness in the air
between the heaves of storm
the eyes beside had wrung them dry,
and breaths were gathering sure
for that last onset, when the king
be witnessed in his power
i willed my keepsakes, signed away
what portion of me i
could make assignable,  and then
there interposed a fly,
with blue, uncertain, stumbling buzz,
between the light and me
and then the windows failed, and then
i could not see to see
xlvii
adrift a little boat adrift
and night is coming down
will no one guide a little boat
unto the nearest town?
so sailors say, on yesterday,
just as the dusk was brown,
one little boat gave up its strife,
and gurgled down and down
but angels say, on yesterday,
just as the dawn was red,
one little boat oerspent with gales
retrimmed its masts, redecked its sails
exultant, onward sped
xlviii
theres been a death in the opposite house
as lately as today
i know it by the numb look
such houses have alway
the neighbors rustle in and out,
the doctor drives away
a window opens like a pod,
abrupt, mechanically
somebody flings a mattress out,
the children hurry by
they wonder if it died on that,
i used to when a boy
the minister goes stiffly in
as if the house were his,
and he owned all the mourners now,
and little boys besides
and then the milliner, and the man
of the appalling trade,
to take the measure of the house
therell be that dark parade
of tassels and of coaches soon
its easy as a sign,
the intuition of the news
in just a country town
xlix
we never know we go,  when we are going
we jest and shut the door
fate following behind us bolts it,
and we accost no more
l
the souls storm
it struck me every day
the lightning was as new
as if the cloud that instant slit
and let the fire through
it burned me in the night,
it blistered in my dream
it sickened fresh upon my sight
with every mornings beam
i thought that storm was brief,
the maddest, quickest by
but nature lost the date of this,
and left it in the sky

water is taught by thirst
land, by the oceans passed
transport, by throe
peace, by its battles told
love, by memorial mould
birds, by the snow
lii
thirst
we thirst at first,  t is natures act
and later, when we die,
a little water supplicate
of fingers going by
it intimates the finer want,
whose adequate supply
is that great water in the west
termed immortality

a clock stopped  not the mantels
genevas farthest skill
cant put the puppet bowing
that just now dangled still
an awe came on the trinket
the figures hunched with pain,
then quivered out of decimals
into degreeless noon
it will not stir for doctors,
this pendulum of snow
the shopman importunes it,
while cool, concernless no
nods from the gilded pointers,
nods from the seconds slim,
decades of arrogance between
the dial life and him

charlotte brontes grave
all overgrown by cunning moss,
all interspersed with weed,
the little cage of currer bell,
in quiet haworth laid
this bird, observing others,
when frosts too sharp became,
retire to other latitudes,
quietly did the same,
but differed in returning
since yorkshire hills are green,
yet not in all the nests i meet
can nightingale be seen
gathered from many wanderings,
gethsemane can tell
through what transporting anguish
she reached the asphodel
soft fall the sounds of eden
upon her puzzled ear
oh, what an afternoon for heaven,
when bronte entered there

far from love the heavenly father
leads the chosen child
oftener through realm of briar

sleeping
a long, long sleep, a famous sleep
that makes no show for dawn
by stretch of limb or stir of lid,

was ever idleness like this?
within a hut of stone

nor once look up for noon?
lviii
retrospect
t was just this time last year i died
i know i heard the corn,
when i was carried by the farms,
it had the tassels on
i thought how yellow it would look
when richard went to mill
and then i wanted to get out,
but something held my will
i thought just how red apples wedged
the stubbles joints between
and carts went stooping round the fields
to take the pumpkins in
i wondered which would miss me least,
and when thanksgiving came,
if fatherd multiply the plates
to make an even sum
and if my stocking hung too high,
would it blur the christmas glee,
that not a santa claus could reach
the altitude of me?
but this sort grieved myself, and so
i thought how it would be
when just this time, some perfect year,
themselves should come to me
lix
eternity
on this wondrous sea,
sailing silently,
ho pilot, ho
knowest thou the shore
where no breakers roar,
where the storm is oer?
in the silent west
many sails at rest,
their anchors fast
thither i pilot thee,
land, ho eternity
ashore at last
i do not love you as if you were saltrose, or topaz,
or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off
i love you as certain dark things are to be loved,
in secret, between the shadow and the soul
i love you as the plant that never blooms
but carries in itself the light of hidden flowers
thanks to your love a certain solid fragrance,
risen from the earth, lives darkly in my body
i love you without knowing how, or when, or from where
i love you straightforwardly, without complexities or pride
so i love you because i know no other way
than this where i does not exist, nor you,
so close that your hand on my chest is my hand,
so close that your eyes close as i fall asleep
i want you to know
one thing
you know how this is
if i look
at the crystal moon, at the red branch
of the slow autumn at my window,
if i touch
near the fire
the impalpable ash
or the wrinkled body of the log,
everything carries me to you,
as if everything that exists,
aromas, light, metals,
were little boats
that sail
toward those isles of yours that wait for me
well, now,
if little by little you stop loving me
i shall stop loving you little by little
if suddenly
you forget me
do not look for me,
for i shall already have forgotten you
if you think it long and mad,
the wind of banners
that passes through my life,
and you decide
to leave me at the shore
of the heart where i have roots,
remember
that on that day,
at that hour,
i shall lift my arms
and my roots will set off
to seek another land
but
if each day,
each hour,
you feel that you are destined for me
with implacable sweetness,
if each day a flower
climbs up to your lips to seek me,
ah my love, ah my own,
in me all that fire is repeated,
in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten,
my love feeds on your love, beloved,
and as long as you live it will be in your arms
without leaving mine
i crave your mouth, your voice, your hair
silent and starving, i prowl through the streets
bread does not nourish me, dawn disrupts me, all day
i hunt for the liquid measure of your steps
i hunger for your sleek laugh,
your hands the color of a savage harvest,
hunger for the pale stones of your fingernails,
i want to eat your skin like a whole almond
i want to eat the sunbeam flaring in your lovely body,
the sovereign nose of your arrogant face,
i want to eat the fleeting shade of your lashes,
and i pace around hungry, sniffing the twilight,
hunting for you, for your hot heart,
like a puma in the barrens of quitratue
every day you play with the light of the universe
subtle visitor, you arrive in the flower and the water,
you are more than this white head that i hold tightly
as a bunch of flowers, every day, between my hands
you are like nobody since i love you
let me spread you out among yellow garlands
who writes your name in letters of smoke among the stars of the south?
oh let me remember you as you were before you existed
suddenly the wind howls and bangs at my shut window
the sky is a net crammed with shadowy fish
here all the winds let go sooner or later, all of them
the rain takes off her clothes
the birds go by, fleeing
the wind  the wind
i alone can contend against the power of men
the storm whirls dark leaves
and turns loose all the boats that were moored last night to the sky
you are here  oh, you do not run away
you will answer me to the last cry
curl round me as though you were frightened
even so, a strange shadow once ran through your eyes
now, now too, little one, you bring me honeysuckle,
and even your breasts smell of it
while the sad wind goes slaughtering butterflies
i love you, and my happiness bites the plum of your mouth
how you must have suffered getting accustomed to me,
my savage, solitary soul, my name that sends them all running
so many times we have seen the morning star burn, kissing our eyes,
and over our heads the grey light unwinds in turning fans
my words rained over you, stroking you
a long time i have loved the sunned motherofpearl of your body
until i even believe that you own the universe
i will bring you happy flowers from the mountains, bluebells, dark hazels, and rustic baskets of kisses
i want to do with you what spring does with the cherry trees
body of a woman, white hills, white thighs,
you look like a world, lying in surrender
my rough peasants body digs in you
and makes the son leap from the depth of the earth
i was lone like a tunnel the birds fled from me,
and nigh swamped me with its crushing invasion
to survive myself i forged you like a weapon,
like an arrow in my bow, a stone in my sling
but the hour of vengeance falls, and i love you
body of skin, of moss, of eager and firm milk
oh the goblets of the breast oh the eyes of absence
oh the roses of the pubis oh your voice, slow and sad
body of my woman, i will persist in your grace
my thirst, my boundless desire, my shifting road
dark riverbeds where the eternal thirst flows
and weariness follows, and the infinite ache
drunk as drunk on turpentine
from your open kisses,
your wet body wedged
between my wet body and the strake
of our boat that is made of flowers,
feasted, we guide it  our fingers
like tallows adorned with yellow metal
over the skys hot rim,
the days last breath in our sails
pinned by the sun between solstice
and equinox, drowsy and tangled together
we drifted for months and woke
with the bitter taste of land on our lips,
eyelids all sticky, and we longed for lime
and the sound of a rope
lowering a bucket down its well then,
we came by night to the fortunate isles,
and lay like fish
under the net of our kisses
i like for you to be still
it is as though you are absent
and you hear me from far away
and my voice does not touch you
it seems as though your eyes had flown away
and it seems that a kiss had sealed your mouth
as all things are filled with my soul
you emerge from the things
filled with my soul
you are like my soul
a butterfly of dream
and you are like the word melancholy
i like for you to be still
and you seem far away
it sounds as though you are lamenting
a butterfly cooing like a dove
and you hear me from far away
and my voice does not reach you
let me come to be still in your silence
and let me talk to you with your silence
that is bright as a lamp
simple, as a ring
you are like the night
with its stillness and constellations
your silence is that of a star
as remote and candid
i like for you to be still
it is as though you are absent
distant and full of sorrow
so you wouldve died
one word then, one smile is enough
and im happy
happy that its not true
i do not love you except because i love you
i go from loving to not loving you,
from waiting to not waiting for you
my heart moves from cold to fire
i love you only because its you the one i love
i hate you deeply, and hating you
bend to you, and the measure of my changing love for you
is that i do not see you but love you blindly
maybe january light will consume
my heart with its cruel
ray, stealing my key to true calm
in this part of the story i am the one who
dies, the only one, and i will die of love because i love you,
because i love you, love, in fire and blood
my love, if you die and i dont,
lets not give grief an even greater field
no expanse is greater than where we live
dust in the wheat, sand in the deserts,
time, wandering water, the vague wind
swept us like sailing seeds
we might not have found one another in time
this meadow where we find ourselves,
o little infinity we give it back
but love, this love has not ended
just as it never had a birth, it has
no death it is like a long river,
only changing lands, and changing lips
when i cannot look at your face
i look at your feet
your feet of arched bone,
your hard little feet
i know that they support you,
and that your sweet weight
rises upon them
your waist and your breasts,
the doubled purple
of your nipples,
the sockets of your eyes
that have just flown away,
your wide fruit mouth,
your red tresses,
my little tower
but i love your feet
only because they walked
upon the earth and upon
the wind and upon the waters,
until they found me
i am not jealous
of what came before me
come with a man
on your shoulders,
come with a hundred men in your hair,
come with a thousand men between your breasts and your feet,
come like a river
full of drowned men
which flows down to the wild sea,
to the eternal surf, to time
bring them all
to where i am waiting for you
we shall always be alone,
we shall always be you and i
alone on earth
to start our life
i can write the saddest poem of all tonight
write, for instance the night is full of stars,
and the stars, blue, shiver in the distance
the night wind whirls in the sky and sings
i can write the saddest poem of all tonight
i loved her, and sometimes she loved me too
on nights like this, i held her in my arms
i kissed her so many times under the infinite sky
she loved me, sometimes i loved her
how could i not have loved her large, still eyes?
i can write the saddest poem of all tonight
to think i dont have her to feel that ive lost her
to hear the immense night, more immense without her
and the poem falls to the soul as dew to grass
what does it matter that my love couldnt keep her
the night is full of stars and she is not with me
thats all far away, someone sings far away
my soul is lost without her
as if to bring her near, my eyes search for her
my heart searches for her and she is not with me
the same night that whitens the same trees
we, we who were, we are the same no longer
i no longer love her, true, but how much i loved her
my voice searched the wind to touch her ear
someone elses she will be someone elses as she once
belonged to my kisses
her voice, her light body her infinite eyes
i no longer love her, true, but perhaps i love her
love is so short and oblivion so long
because on nights like this i held her in my arms,
my soul is lost without her
although this may be the last pain she causes me,
and this may be the last poem i write for her
dont go far off, not even for a day
dont go far off, not even for a day,
because i dont know how to say it  a day is long
and i will be waiting for you, as in
an empty station when the trains are
parked off somewhere else, asleep
dont leave me, even for an hour, because then
the little drops of anguish will all run together,
the smoke that roams looking for a home will drift
into me, choking my lost heart
oh, may your silhouette never dissolve
on the beach, may your eyelids never flutter
into the empty distance dont leave me for
a second, my dearest, because in that moment youll
have gone so far ill wander mazily
over all the earth, asking, will you
come back? will you leave me here, dying?
naked you are simple as one of your hands
smooth, earthy, small, transparent, round
youve moonlines, apple pathways
naked you are slender as a naked grain of wheat
naked you are blue as a night in cuba
youve vines and stars in your hair
naked you are spacious and yellow
as summer in a golden church
naked you are tiny as one of your nails
curved, subtle, rosy, till the day is born
and you withdraw to the underground world
as if down a long tunnel of clothing and of chores
your clear light dims, gets dressed, drops its leaves,
and becomes a naked hand again
tonight i can write the saddest lines
write, for example, the night is starry
and the stars are blue and shiver in the distance
the night wind revolves in the sky and sings
tonight i can write the saddest lines
i loved her, and sometimes she loved me too
through nights like this one i held her in my arms
i kissed her again and again under the endless sky
she loved me, sometimes i loved her too
how could one not have loved her great still eyes
tonight i can write the saddest lines
to think that i do not have her to feel that i have lost her
to hear the immense night, still more immense without her
and the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture
what does it matter that my love could not keep her
the night is starry and she is not with me
this is all in the distance someone is singing in the distance
my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her
my sight tries to find her as though to bring her closer
my heart looks for her, and she is not with me
the same night whitening the same trees
we, of that time, are no longer the same
i no longer love her, thats certain, but how i loved her
my voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing
anothers she will be anothers as she was before my kisses
her voice, her bright body her infinite eyes
i no longer love her, thats certain, but maybe i love her
love is so short, forgetting is so long
because through nights like this one i held her in my arms
my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her
though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer
and these the last verses that i write for her
whats wrong with you, with us,
whats happening to us?
ah our love is a harsh cord
that binds us wounding us
and if we want
to leave our wound,
to separate,
it makes a new knot for us and condemns us
to drain our blood and burn together
whats wrong with you? i look at you
and i find nothing in you but two eyes
like all eyes, a mouth
lost among a thousand mouths that i have kissed, more beautiful,
a body just like those that have slipped
beneath my body without leaving any memory
and how empty you went through the world
like a wheatcolored jar
without air, without sound, without substance
i vainly sought in you
depth for my arms
that dig, without cease, beneath the earth
beneath your skin, beneath your eyes,
nothing,
beneath your double breast scarcely
raised
a current of crystalline order
that does not know why it flows singing
why, why, why,
my love, why?
ah vastness of pines, murmur of waves breaking,
slow play of lights, solitary bell,
twilight falling in your eyes, toy doll,
earthshell, in whom the earth sings
in you the rivers sing and my soul flees in them
as you desire, and you send it where you will
aim my road on your bow of hope
and in a frenzy i will flee my flock of arrows
on all sides i see your waist of fog,
and your silence hunts down my afflicted hours
my kisses anchor, and my moist desire nests
in your arms of transparent stone
ah your mysterious voice that love tolls and darkens
in the resonant and dying evening
thus in the deep hours i have seen, over the fields,
the ears of wheat tolling in the mouth of the wind
you are the daughter of the sea, oreganos first cousin
swimmer, your body is pure as the water
cook, your blood is quick as the soil
everything you do is full of flowers, rich with the earth
your eyes go out toward the water, and the waves rise
your hands go out to the earth and the seeds swell
you know the deep essence of water and the earth,
conjoined in you like a formula for clay
naiad cut your body into turquoise pieces,
they will bloom resurrected in the kitchen
this is how you become everything that lives
and so at last, you sleep, in the circle of my arms
that push back the shadows so that you can rest
vegetables, seaweed, herbs the foam of your dreams
i dont love you as if you were the saltrose, topaz
or arrow of carnations that propagate fire
i love you as certain dark things are loved,
secretly, between the shadow and the soul
i love you as the plant that doesnt bloom and carries
hidden within itself the light of those flowers,
and thanks to your love, darkly in my body
lives the dense fragrance that rises from the earth
i love you without knowing how, or when, or from where,
i love you simply, without problems or pride
i love you in this way because i dont know any other way of loving
but this, in which there is no i or you,
so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand,
so intimate that when i fall asleep it is your eyes that close
the light wraps you in its mortal flame
abstracted pale mourner, standing that way
against the old propellers of the twighlight
that revolves around you
speechless, my friend,
alone in the loneliness of this hour of the dead
and filled with the lives of fire,
pure heir of the ruined day
a bough of fruit falls from the sun on your dark garment
the great roots of night
grow suddenly from your soul,
and the things that hide in you come out again
so that a blue and palled people
your newly born, takes nourishment
oh magnificent and fecund and magnetic slave
of the circle that moves in turn through black and gold
rise, lead and possess a creation
so rich in life that its flowers perish
and it is full of sadness
dont go far off, not even for a day, because
because  i dont know how to say it a day is long
and i will be waiting for you, as in an empty station
when the trains are parked off somewhere else, asleep
dont leave me, even for an hour, because
then the little drops of anguish will all run together,
the smoke that roams looking for a home will drift
into me, choking my lost heart
oh, may your silhouette never dissolve on the beach
may your eyelids never flutter into the empty distance
dont leave me for a second, my dearest,
because in that moment youll have gone so far
ill wander mazily over all the earth, asking,
will you come back? will you leave me here, dying?
so that you will hear me
my words
sometimes grow thin
as the tracks of the gulls on the beaches
necklace, drunken bell
for your hands smooth as grapes
and i watch my words from a long way off
they are more yours than mine
they climb on my old suffering like ivy
it climbs the same way on damp walls
you are to blame for this cruel sport
they are fleeing from my dark lair
you fill everything, you fill everything
before you they peopled the solitude that you occupy,
and they are more used to my sadness than you are
now i want them to say what i want to say to you
to make you hear as i want you to hear me
the wind of anguish still hauls on them as usual
sometimes hurricanes of dreams still knock them over
you listen to other voices in my painful voice
lament of old mouths, blood of old supplications
love me, companion dont forsake me follow me
follow me, companion, on this wave of anguish
but my words become stained with your love
you occupy everything, you occupy everything
i am making them into an endless necklace
for your white hands, smooth as grapes
so that you will hear me
my words
sometimes grow thin
as the tracks of the gulls on the beaches
necklace, drunken bell
for your hands smooth as grapes
and i watch my words from a long way off
they are more yours than mine
they climb on my old suffering like ivy
it climbs the same way on damp walls
you are to blame for this cruel sport
they are fleeing from my dark lair
you fill everything, you fill everything
before you they peopled the solitude that you occupy,
and they are more used to my sadness than you are
now i want them to say what i want to say to you
to make you hear as i want you to hear me
the wind of anguish still hauls on them as usual
sometimes hurricanes of dreams still knock them over
you listen to other voices in my painful voice
lament of old mouths, blood of old supplications
love me, companion dont forsake me follow me
follow me, companion, on this wave of anguish
but my words become stained with your love
you occupy everything, you occupy everything
i am making them into an endless necklace
for your white hands, smooth as grapes
it was the twilight of the iguana
from the rainbowarch of the battlements,
his long tongue like a lance
sank down in the green leaves,
and a swarm of ants, monks with feet chanting,
crawled off into the jungle,
the guanaco, thin as oxygen
in the wide peaks of cloud,
went along, wearing his shoes of gold,
while the llama opened his honest eyes
on the breakable neatness
of a world full of dew
the monkeys braided a sexual
thread that went on and on
along the shores of dawn,
demolishing walls of pollen
and startling the butterflies of muzo
into flying violets
it was the night of the alligators,
the pure night, crawling
with snouts emrging from ooze,
and out the sleepy marshes
the confused noise of scaly plates
returned to the ground where they began
the jaguar brushed the leaves
with a luminous absence,
the puma runs through the branches
like a forest fire,
while the jungles drunken eyes
burn from inside him
the badgers scratch the rivers
feet, scenting the nest
whost throbbing delicacy
they attack with red teeth
and deep in the huge waters
the enormous anaconda lies
like the circle around the earth,
covered with ceremonies of mud,
devouring, religious
leaning into the afternoons,
i cast my sad nets towards your oceanic eyes
there, in the highest blaze my solitude lengthens and flames
its arms turning like a drowning mans
i send out red signals across your absent eyes
that wave like the sea, or the beach by a lighthouse
you keep only darkness my distant female
from your regard sometimes, the coast of dread emerges
leaning into the afternoons,
i fling my sad nets to that sea that is thrashed
by your oceanic eyes
the birds of night peck at the first stars
that flash like my soul when i love you
the night, gallops on its shadowy mare
shedding blue tassels over the land
leaning into the afternoons,
i cast my sad nets towards your oceanic eyes
there, in the highest blaze my solitude lengthens and flames
its arms turning like a drowning mans
i send out red signals across your absent eyes
that wave like the sea, or the beach by a lighthouse
you keep only darkness my distant female
from your regard sometimes, the coast of dread emerges
leaning into the afternoons,
i fling my sad nets to that sea that is thrashed
by your oceanic eyes
the birds of night peck at the first stars
that flash like my soul when i love you
the night, gallops on its shadowy mare
shedding blue tassels over the land
leaning into the afternoons,
i cast my sad nets towards your oceanic eyes
there, in the highest blaze my solitude lengthens and flames
its arms turning like a drowning mans
i send out red signals across your absent eyes
that wave like the sea, or the beach by a lighthouse
you keep only darkness my distant female
from your regard sometimes, the coast of dread emerges
leaning into the afternoons,
i fling my sad nets to that sea that is thrashed
by your oceanic eyes
the birds of night peck at the first stars
that flash like my soul when i love you
the night, gallops on its shadowy mare
shedding blue tassels over the land
the artichoke
of delicate heart
erect
in its battledress, builds
its minimal cupola
keeps
stark
in its scallop of
scales
around it,
demoniac vegetables
bristle their thicknesses,
devise
tendrils and belfries,
the bulbs agitations
while under the subsoil
the carrot
sleeps sound in its
rusty mustaches
runner and filaments
bleach in the vineyards,
whereon rise the vines
the sedulous cabbage
arranges its petticoats
oregano
sweetens a world
and the artichoke
dulcetly there in a gardenplot,
armed for a skirmish,
goes proud
in its pomegranate
burnishes
till, on a day,
each by the other,
the artichoke moves
to its dream
of a market place
in the big willow
hoppers
a battle formation
most warlike
of defilades
with men
in the market stalls,
white shirts
in the soupgreens,
artichoke field marshals,
closeorder conclaves,
commands, detonations,
and voices,
a crashing of crate staves
and
maria
come
down
with her hamper
to
make trial
of an artichoke
she reflects, she examines,
she candles them up to the light like an egg,
never flinching
she bargains,
she tumbles her prize
in a market bag
among shoes and a
cabbage head,
a bottle
of vinegar is back
in her kitchen
the artichoke drowns in a pot
so you have it
a vegetable, armed,
a profession
call it an artichoke
whose end
is millennial
we taste of that
sweetness,
dismembering scale after scale
we eat of a halcyon paste
it is green at the artichoke heart
ode to a lemon
out of lemon flowers
loosed
on the moonlight, loves
lashed and insatiable
essences,
sodden with fragrance,
the lemon trees yellow
emerges,
the lemons
move down
from the trees planetarium
delicate merchandise
the harbors are big with it
bazaars
for the light and the
barbarous gold
we open
the halves
of a miracle,
and a clotting of acids
brims
into the starry
divisions
creations
original juices,
irreducible, changeless,
alive
so the freshness lives on
in a lemon,
in the sweetsmelling house of the rind,
the proportions, arcane and acerb
cutting the lemon
the knife
leaves a little cathedral
alcoves unguessed by the eye
that open acidulous glass
to the light topazes
riding the droplets,
altars,
aromatic facades
so, while the hand
holds the cut of the lemon,
half a world
on a trencher,
the gold of the universe
wells
to your touch
a cup yellow
with miracles,
a breast and a nipple
perfuming the earth
a flashing made fruitage,
the diminutive fire of a planet

a dented spider like a snow drop white
on a white healall, holding up a moth
like a white piece of lifeless satin cloth
saw ever curious eye so strange a sight?
portent in little, assorted death and blight
like the ingredients of a witches broth?
the beady spider, the flower like a froth,
and the moth carried like a paper kite
what had that flower to do with being white,
the blue prunella every childs delight
what brought the kindred spider to that height?
make we no thesis of the millers plight
what but design of darkness and of night?
design, design do i use the word aright?
anonymous submission
a boundless moment
he halted in the wind, and  what was that
far in the maples, pale, but not a ghost?
he stood there bringing march against his thought,
and yet too ready to believe the most
oh, thats the paradiseinbloom, i said
and truly it was fair enough for flowers
had we but in us to assume in march
such white luxuriance of may for ours
we stood a moment so in a strange world,
myself as one his own pretense deceives
and then i said the truth and we moved on
a young beech clinging to its last years leaves
a brook in the city
the farmhouse lingers, though averse to square
with the new city street it has to wear
a number in but what about the brook
that held the house as in an elbowcrook?
i ask as one who knew the brook, its strength
and impulse, having dipped a finger length
and made it leap my knuckle, having tossed
a flower to try its currents where they crossed
the meadow grass could be cemented down
from growing under pavements of a town
the apple trees be sent to hearthstone flame
is water wood to serve a brook the same?
how else dispose of an immortal force
no longer needed? staunch it at its source
with cinder loads dumped down? the brook was thrown
deep in a sewer dungeon under stone
in fetid darkness still to live and run
and all for nothing it had ever done
except forget to go in fear perhaps
no one would know except for ancient maps
that such a brook ran water but i wonder
if from its being kept forever under,
the thoughts may not have risen that so keep
this newbuilt city from both work and sleep
a cliff dwelling
there sandy seems the golden sky
and golden seems the sandy plain
no habitation meets the eye
unless in the horizon rim,
some halfway up the limestone wall,
that spot of black is not a stain
or shadow, but a cavern hole,
where someone used to climb and crawl
to rest from his besetting fears
i see the callus on his soul
the disappearing last of him
and of his race starvation slim,
oh years ago  ten thousand years
a considerable speck
microscopic
a speck that would have been beneath my sight
on any but a paper sheet so white
set off across what i had written there
and i had idly poised my pen in air
to stop it with a period of ink
when something strange about it made me think,
this was no dust speck by my breathing blown,
but unmistakably a living mite
with inclinations it could call its own
it paused as with suspicion of my pen,
and then came racing wildly on again
to where my manuscript was not yet dry
then paused again and either drank or smelt
with loathing, for again it turned to fly
plainly with an intelligence i dealt
it seemed too tiny to have room for feet,
yet must have had a set of them complete
to express how much it didnt want to die
it ran with terror and with cunning crept
it faltered i could see it hesitate
then in the middle of the open sheet
cower down in desperation to accept
whatever i accorded it of fate
i have none of the tendererthanthou
collectivistic regimenting love
with which the modern world is being swept
but this poor microscopic item now
since it was nothing i knew evil of
i let it lie there till i hope it slept
i have a mind myself and recognize
mind when i meet with it in any guise
no one can know how glad i am to find
on any sheet the least display of mind
a dream pang
i had withdrawn in forest, and my song
was swallowed up in leaves that blew alway
and to the forest edge you came one day
this was my dream and looked and pondered long,
but did not enter, though the wish was strong
you shook your pensive head as who should say,
i dare nottoo far in his footsteps stray
he must seek me would he undo the wrong
not far, but near, i stood and saw it all
behind low boughs the trees let down outside
and the sweet pang it cost me not to call
and tell you that i saw does still abide
but tis not true that thus i dwelt aloof,
for the wood wakes, and you are here for proof
a late walk
when i go up through the mowing field,
the headless aftermath,
smoothlaid like thatch with the heavy dew,
half closes the garden path
and when i come to the garden ground,
the whir of sober birds
up from the tangle of withered weeds
is sadder than any words
a tree beside the wall stands bare,
but a leaf that lingered brown,
disturbed, i doubt not, by my thought,
comes softly rattling down
i end not far from my going forth
by picking the faded blue
of the last remaining aster flower
to carry again to you
a linestorm song
the linestorm clouds fly tattered and swift,
the road is forlorn all day,
where a myriad snowy quartz stones lift,
and the hoofprints vanish away
the roadside flowers, too wet for the bee,
expend their bloom in vain
come over the hills and far with me,
and be my love in the rain
the birds have less to say for themselves
in the woodworlds torn despair
than now these numberless years the elves,
although they are no less there
all song of the woods is crushed like some
wild, easily shattered rose
come, be my love in the wet woods come,
where the boughs rain when it blows
there is the gale to urge behind
and bruit our singing down,
and the shallow waters aflutter with wind
from which to gather your gown
what matter if we go clear to the west,
and come not through dryshod?
for wilding brooch shall wet your breast
the rainfresh goldenrod
oh, never this whelming east wind swells
but it seems like the seas return
to the ancient lands where it left the shells
before the age of the fern
and it seems like the time when after doubt
our love came back amain
oh, come forth into the storm and rout
and be my love in the rain
a minor bird
i have wished a bird would fly away,
and not sing by my house all day
have clapped my hands at him from the door
when it seemed as if i could bear no more
the fault must partly have been in me
the bird was not to blame for his key
and of course there must be something wrong
in wanting to silence any song
a patch of old snow
theres a patch of old snow in a corner
that i should have guessed
was a blowaway paper the rain
had brought to rest
it is speckled with grime as if
small print overspread it,
the news of a day ive forgotten
if i ever read it
a prayer in spring
oh, give us pleasure in the flowers today
and give us not to think so far away
as the uncertain harvest keep us here
all simply in the springing of the year
oh, give us pleasure in the orchard white,
like nothing else by day, like ghosts by night
and make us happy in the happy bees,
the swarm dilating round the perfect trees
and make us happy in the darting bird
that suddenly above the bees is heard,
the meteor that thrusts in with needle bill,
and off a blossom in mid air stands still
for this is love and nothing else is love,
the which it is reserved for god above
to sanctify to what far ends he will,
but which it only needs that we fulfil
a question
a voice said, look me in the stars
and tell me truly, men of earth,
if all the soulandbody scars
were not too much to pay for birth
a servant to servants
i didnt make you know how glad i was
to have you come and camp here on our land
i promised myself to get down some day
and see the way you lived, but i dont know
with a houseful of hungry men to feed
i guess youd find it seems to me
i cant express my feelings any more
than i can raise my voice or want to lift
my hand oh, i can lift it when i have to
did ever you feel so? i hope you never
its got so i dont even know for sure
whether i am glad, sorry, or anything
theres nothing but a voicelike left inside
that seems to tell me how i ought to feel,
and would feel if i wasnt all gone wrong
you take the lake i look and look at it
i see its a fair, pretty sheet of water
i stand and make myself repeat out loud
the advantages it has, so long and narrow,
like a deep piece of some old running river
cut short off at both ends it lies five miles
straight away through the mountain notch
from the sink window where i wash the plates,
and all our storms come up toward the house,
drawing the slow waves whiter and whiter and whiter
it took my mind off doughnuts and soda biscuit
to step outdoors and take the water dazzle
a sunny morning, or take the rising wind
about my face and body and through my wrapper,
when a storm threatened from the dragons den,
and a cold chill shivered across the lake
i see its a fair, pretty sheet of water,
our willoughby how did you hear of it?
i expect, though, everyones heard of it
in a book about ferns? listen to that
you let things more like feathers regulate
your going and coming and you like it here?
i can see how you might but i dont know
it would be different if more people came,
for then there would be business as it is,
the cottages len built, sometimes we rent them,
sometimes we dont weve a good piece of shore
that ought to be worth something, and may yet
but i dont count on it as much as len
he looks on the bright side of everything,
including me he thinks ill be all right
with doctoring but its not medicine
lowe is the only doctors dared to say so
its rest i wantthere, i have said it out
from cooking meals for hungry hired men
and washing dishes after themfrom doing
things over and over that just wont stay done
by good rights i ought not to have so much
put on me, but there seems no other way
len says one steady pull more ought to do it
he says the best way out is always through
and i agree to that, or in so far
as that i can see no way out but through
leastways for meand then theyll be convinced
its not that len dont want the best for me
it was his plan our moving over in
beside the lake from where that day i showed you
we used to liveten miles from anywhere
we didnt change without some sacrifice,
but len went at it to make up the loss
his works a mans, of course, from sun to sun,
but he works when he works as hard as i do
though theres small profit in comparisons
women and men will make them all the same
but work aint all len undertakes too much
hes into everything in town this year
its highways, and hes got too many men
around him to look after that make waste
they take advantage of him shamefully,
and proud, too, of themselves for doing so
we have four here to board, great goodfornothings,
sprawling about the kitchen with their talk
while i fry their bacon much they care
no more put out in what they do or say
than if i wasnt in the room at all
coming and going all the time, they are
i dont learn what their names are, let alone
their characters, or whether they are safe
to have inside the house with doors unlocked
im not afraid of them, though, if theyre not
afraid of me theres two can play at that
i have my fancies it runs in the family
my fathers brother wasnt right they kept him
locked up for years back there at the old farm
ive been away onceyes, ive been away
the state asylum i was prejudiced
i wouldnt have sent anyone of mine there
you know the old ideathe only asylum
was the poorhouse, and those who could afford,
rather than send their folks to such a place,
kept them at home and it does seem more human
but its not so the place is the asylum
there they have every means proper to do with,
and you arent darkening other peoples lives
worse than no good to them, and they no good
to you in your condition you cant know
affection or the want of it in that state
ive heard too much of the oldfashioned way
my fathers brother, he went mad quite young
some thought he had been bitten by a dog,
because his violence took on the form
of carrying his pillow in his teeth
but its more likely he was crossed in love,
or so the story goes it was some girl
anyway all he talked about was love
they soon saw he would do someone a mischief
if he want kept strict watch of, and it ended
in fathers building him a sort of cage,
or room within a room, of hickory poles,
like stanchions in the barn, from floor to ceiling,
a narrow passage all the way around
anything they put in for furniture
hed tear to pieces, even a bed to lie on
so they made the place comfortable with straw,
like a beasts stall, to ease their consciences
of course they had to feed him without dishes
they tried to keep him clothed, but he paraded
with his clothes on his armall of his clothes
cruelit sounds i spose they did the best
they knew and just when he was at the height,
father and mother married, and mother came,
a bride, to help take care of such a creature,
and accommodate her young life to his
that was what marrying father meant to her
she had to lie and hear love things made dreadful
by his shouts in the night hed shout and shout
until the strength was shouted out of him,
and his voice died down slowly from exhaustion
hed pull his bars apart like bow and bowstring,
and let them go and make them twang until
his hands had worn them smooth as any oxbow
and then hed crow as if he thought that childs play
the only fun he had ive heard them say, though,
they found a way to put a stop to it
he was before my timei never saw him
but the pen stayed exactly as it was
there in the upper chamber in the ell,
a sort of catchall full of attic clutter
i often think of the smooth hickory bars
it got so i would sayyou know, half fooling
its time i took my turn upstairs in jail
just as you will till it becomes a habit
no wonder i was glad to get away
mind you, i waited till len said the word
i didnt want the blame if things went wrong
i was glad though, no end, when we moved out,
and i looked to be happy, and i was,
as i said, for a whilebut i dont know
somehow the change wore out like a prescription
and theres more to it than just windowviews
and living by a lake im past such help
unless len took the notion, which he wont,
and i wont ask himits not sure enough
i spose ive got to go the road im going
other folks have to, and why shouldnt i?
i almost think if i could do like you,
drop everything and live out on the ground
but it might be, come night, i shouldnt like it,
or a long rain i should soon get enough,
and be glad of a good roof overhead
ive lain awake thinking of you, ill warrant,
more than you have yourself, some of these nights
the wonder was the tents werent snatched away
from over you as you lay in your beds
i havent courage for a risk like that
bless you, of course, youre keeping me from work,
but the thing of it is, i need to be kept
theres work enough to dotheres always that
but behinds behind the worst that you can do
is set me back a little more behind
i shant catch up in this world, anyway
id rather youd not go unless you must
a soldier
he is that fallen lance that lies as hurled,
that lies unlifted now, come dew, come rust,
but still lies pointed as it plowed the dust
if we who sight along it round the world,
see nothing worthy to have been its mark,
it is because like men we look too near,
forgetting that as fitted to the sphere,
our missiles always make too short an arc
they fall, they rip the grass, they intersect
the curve of earth, and striking, break their own
they make us cringe for metalpoint on stone
but this we know, the obstacle that checked
and tripped the body, shot the spirit on
further than target ever showed or shone
a time to talk
when a friend calls to me from the road
and slows his horse to a meaning walk,
i dont stand still and look around
on all the hills i havent hoed,
and shout from where i am, what is it?
no, not as there is a time to talk
i thrust my hoe in the mellow ground,
bladeend up and five feet tall,
and plod i go up to the stone wall
for a friendly visit
acquainted with the night
i have been one acquainted with the night
i have walked out in rain  and back in rain
i have outwalked the furthest city light
i have looked down the saddest city lane
i have passed by the watchman on his beat
and dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain
i have stood still and stopped the sound of feet
when far away an interrupted cry
came over houses from another street,
but not to call me back or say goodbye
and further still at an unearthly height,
a luminary clock against the sky
proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right
i have been one acquainted with the night
after apple picking
my long twopointed ladders sticking through a tree
toward heaven still
and theres a barrel that i didnt fill
beside it, and there may be two or three
apples i didnt pick upon some bough
but i am done with applepicking now
essence of winter sleep is on the night,
the scent of apples i am drowsing off
i cannot shake the shimmer from my sight
i got from looking through a pane of glass
i skimmed this morning from the watertrough,
and held against the world of hoary grass
it melted, and i let it fall and break
but i was well
upon my way to sleep before it fell,
and i could tell
what form my dreaming was about to take
magnified apples appear and reappear,
stem end and blossom end,
and every fleck of russet showing clear
my instep arch not only keeps the ache,
it keeps the pressure of a ladderround
and i keep hearing from the cellarbin
that rumbling sound
of load on load of apples coming in
for i have had too much
of applepicking i am overtired
of the great harvest i myself desired
there were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch,
cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall,
for all
that struck the earth,
no matter if not bruised, or spiked with stubble,
went surely to the ciderapple heap
as of no worth
one can see what will trouble
this sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is
were he not gone,
the woodchuck could say whether its like his
long sleep, as i describe its coming on,
or just some human sleep
after applepicking
my long twopointed ladders sticking through a tree
toward heaven still,
and theres a barrel that i didnt fill
beside it, and there may be two or three
apples i didnt pick upon some bough
but i am done with applepicking now
essence of winter sleep is on the night,
the scent of apples i am drowsing off
i cannot rub the strangeness from my sight
i got from looking through a pane of glass
i skimmed this morning from the drinking trough
and held against the world of hoary grass
it melted, and i let it fall and break
but i was well
upon my way to sleep before it fell,
and i could tell
what form my dreaming was about to take
magnified apples appear and disappear,
stem end and blossom end,
and every fleck of russet showing clear
my instep arch not only keeps the ache,
it keeps the pressure of a ladderround
i feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend
and i keep hearing from the cellar bin
the rumbling sound
of load on load of apples coming in
for i have had too much
of applepicking i am overtired
of the great harvest i myself desired
there were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch,
cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall
for all
that struck the earth,
no matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble,
went surely to the ciderapple heap
as of no worth
one can see what will trouble
this sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is
were he not gone,
the woodchuck could say whether its like his
long sleep, as i describe its coming on,
or just some human sleep
an old mans winter night
all out of doors looked darkly in at him
through the thin frost, almost in separate stars,
that gathers on the pane in empty rooms
what kept his eyes from giving back the gaze
was the lamp tilted near them in his hand
what kept him from remembering what it was
that brought him to that creaking room was age
he stood with barrels round him  at a loss
and having scared the cellar under him
in clomping there, he scared it once again
in clomping off  and scared the outer night,
which has its sounds, familiar, like the roar
of trees and crack of branches, common things,
but nothing so like beating on a box
a light he was to no one but himself
where now he sat, concerned with he knew what,
a quiet light, and then not even that
he consigned to the moon, such as she was,
so latearising, to the broken moon
as better than the sun in any case
for such a charge, his snow upon the roof,
his icicles along the wall to keep
and slept the log that shifted with a jolt
once in the stove, disturbed him and he shifted,
and eased his heavy breathing, but still slept
one aged man  one man  cant keep a house,
a farm, a countryside, or if he can,
its thus he does it of a winter night
asking for roses
a house that lacks, seemingly, mistress and master,
with doors that none but the wind ever closes,
its floor all littered with glass and with plaster
it stands in a garden of oldfashioned roses
i pass by that way in the gloaming with mary
i wonder, i say, who the owner of those is
oh, no one you know, she answers me airy,
but one we must ask if we want any roses
so we must join hands in the dew coming coldly
there in the hush of the wood that reposes,
and turn and go up to the open door boldly,
and knock to the echoes as beggars for roses
pray, are you within there, mistress whowereyou?
tis mary that speaks and our errand discloses
pray, are you within there? bestir you, bestir you
tis summer again theres two come for roses
a word with you, that of the singer recalling
old herrick a saying that every maid knows is
a flower unplucked is but left to the falling,
and nothing is gained by not gathering roses
we do not loosen our hands intertwining
not caring so very much what she supposes,
there when she comes on us mistily shining
and grants us by silence the boon of her roses
bereft
where had i heard this wind before
change like this to a deeper roar?
what would it take my standing there for,
holding open a restive door,
looking down hill to a frothy shore?
summer was past and the day was past
sombre clouds in the west were massed
out on the porchs sagging floor,
leaves got up in a coil and hissed,
blindly striking at my knee and missed
something sinister in the tone
told me my secret my be known
word i was in the house alone
somehow must have gotten abroad,
word i was in my life alone,
word i had no one left but god
birches
when i see birches bend to left and right
across the lines of straighter darker trees,
i like to think some boys been swinging them
but swinging doesnt bend them down to stay
icestorms do that often you must have seen them
loaded with ice a sunny winter morning
after a rain they click upon themselves
as the breeze rises, and turn manycoloured
as the stir cracks and crazes their enamel
soon the suns warmth makes them shed crystal shells
shattering and avalanching on the snowcrust
such heaps of broken glass to sweep away
youd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen
they are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,
and they seem not to break though once they are bowed
so low for long, they never right themselves
you may see their trunks arching in the woods
years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground,
like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair
before them over their heads to dry in the sun
but i was going to say when truth broke in
with all her matteroffact about the icestorm,
i should prefer to have some boy bend them
as he went out and in to fetch the cows
some boy too far from town to learn baseball,
whose only play was what he found himself,
summer or winter, and could play alone
one by one he subdued his fathers trees
by riding them down over and over again
until he took the stiffness out of them,
and not one but hung limp, not one was left
for him to conquer he learned all there was
to learn about not launching out too soon
and so not carrying the tree away
clear to the ground he always kept his poise
to the top branches, climbing carefully
with the same pains you use to fill a cup
up to the brim, and even above the brim
then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,
kicking his way down through the air to the ground
so was i once myself a swinger of birches
and so i dream of going back to be
its when im weary of considerations,
and life is too much like a pathless wood
where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs
broken across it, and one eye is weeping
from a twigs having lashed across it open
id like to get away from earth awhile
and then come back to it and begin over
may no fate willfully misunderstand me
and half grant what i wish and snatch me away
not to return earths the right place for love
i dont know where its likely to go better
id like to go by climbing a birch tree
and climb black branches up a snowwhite trunk
toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more,
but dipped its top and set me down again
that would be good both going and coming back
one could do worse than be a swinger of birches
bond and free
love has earth to which she clings
with hills and circling arms about
wall within wall to shut fear out
but thought has need of no such things,
for thought has a pair of dauntless wings
on snow and sand and turn, i see
where love has left a printed trace
with straining in the worlds embrace
and such is love and glad to be
but thought has shaken his ankles free
thought cleaves the interstellar gloom
and sits in sirius disc all night,
till day makes him retrace his flight
with smell of burning on every plume,
back past the sun to an earthly room
his gains in heaven are what they are
yet some say love by being thrall
and simply staying possesses all
in several beauty that thought fares far
to find fused in another star
but outer space
but outer space,
at least this far,
for all the fuss
of the populace
stays more popular
than populous
come in
as i came to the edge of the woods,
thrush music  hark
now if it was dusk outside,
inside it was dark
too dark in the woods for a bird
by sleight of wing
to better its perch for the night,
though it still could sing
the last of the light of the sun
that had died in the west
still lived for one song more
in a thrushs breast
far in the pillared dark
thrush music went
almost like a call to come in
to the dark and lament
but no, i was out for stars
i would not come in
i meant not even if asked
and i hadnt been
desert places
snow falling and night falling fast, oh, fast
in a field i looked into going past,
and the ground almost covered smooth in snow,
but a few weeds and stubble showing last
the woods around it have it  it is theirs
all animals are smothered in their lairs
i am too absentspirited to count
the loneliness includes me unawares
and lonely as it is, that loneliness
will be more lonely ere it will be less
a blanker whiteness of benighted snow
with no expression, nothing to express
they cannot scare me with their empty spaces
between stars  on stars where no human race is
i have it in me so much nearer home
to scare myself with my own desert places
design
i found a dimpled spider, fat and white,
on a white healall, holding up a moth
like a white piece of rigid satin cloth
assorted characters of death and blight
mixed ready to begin the morning right,
like the ingredients of a witches broth
a snowdrop spider, a flower like a froth,
and dead wings carried like a paper kite
what had that flower to do with being white,
the wayside blue and innocent healall?
what brought the kindred spider to that height,
then steered the white moth thither in the night?
what but design of darkness to appall?
if design govern in a thing so small
devotion
the heart can think of no devotion
greater than being shore to ocean
holding the curve of one position,
counting an endless repetition
dust of snow
the way a crow
shook down on me
the dust of snow
from a hemlock tree
has given my heart
a change of mood
and saved some part
of a day i had rued
evening in a sugar orchard
from where i lingered in a lull in march
outside the sugarhouse one night for choice,
i called the fireman with a careful voice
and bade him leave the pan and stoke the arch
o fireman, give the fire another stoke,
and send more sparks up chimney with the smoke
i thought a few might tangle, as they did,
among bare maple boughs, and in the rare
hill atmosphere not cease to glow,
and so be added to the moon up there
the moon, though slight, was moon enough to show
on every tree a bucket with a lid,
and on black ground a bearskin rug of snow
the sparks made no attempt to be the moon
they were content to figure in the trees
as leo, orion, and the pleiades
and that was what the boughs were full of soon
fire and ice
some say the world will end in fire,
some say in ice
from what ive tasted of desire
i hold with those who favor fire
but if it had to perish twice,
i think i know enough of hate
to say that for destruction ice
is also great
and would suffice
fireflies in the garden
here come real stars to fill the upper skies,
and here on earth come emulating flies,
that though they never equal stars in size,
and they were never really stars at heart
achieve at times a very starlike start
only, of course, they cant sustain the part
flowergathering
i left you in the morning, and in the morning glow, you walked a way beside me to
make me sad to go do you know me in the gloaming, gaunt and dusty gray with
roaming? are you dumb because you know me not, or dumb because you know? all
for me and not a question for the faded flowers gay that could take me from beside
you for the ages of a day? they are yours, and be the measure of their worth for you
to treasure, the measure of the little while that ive been long away
for once, then something
others taught me with having knelt at wellcurbs
always wrong to the light, so never seeing
deeper down in the well than where the water
gives me back in a shining surface picture
me myself in the summer heaven godlike
looking out of a wreath of fern and cloud puffs
once, when trying with chin against a wellcurb,
i discerned, as i thought, beyond the picture,
through the picture, a something white, uncertain,
something more of the depthsand then i lost it
water came to rebuke the too clear water
one drop fell from a fern, and lo, a ripple
shook whatever it was lay there at bottom,
blurred it, blotted it out what was that whiteness?
truth? a pebble of quartz? for once, then, something
for once, then, something
others taught me with having knelt at wellcurbs
always wrong to the light, so never seeing
deeper down in the well than where the water
gives me back in a shining surface picture
me myself in the summer heaven godlike
looking out of a wreath of fern and cloud puffs
once, when trying with chin against a wellcurb,
i discerned, as i thought, beyond the picture,
through the picture, a something white, uncertain,
something more of the depthsand then i lost it
water came to rebuke the too clear water
one drop fell from a fern, and lo, a ripple
shook whatever it was lay there at bottom,
blurred it, blotted it out what was that whiteness?
truth? a pebble of quartz? for once, then, something
fragmentary blue
why make so much of fragmentary blue
in here and there a bird, or butterfly,
or flower, or wearingstone, or open eye,
when heaven presents in sheets the solid hue?
since earth is earth, perhaps, not heaven as yet
though some savants make earth include the sky
and blue so far above us comes so high,
it only gives our wish for blue a whet
gathering leaves
spades take up leaves
no better than spoons,
and bags full of leaves
are light as balloons
i make a great noise
of rustling all day
like rabbit and deer
running away
but the mountains i raise
elude my embrace,
flowing over my arms
and into my face
i may load and unload
again and again
till i fill the whole shed,
and what have i then?
next to nothing for weight,
and since they grew duller
from contact with earth,
next to nothing for color
next to nothing for use
but a crop is a crop,
and whos to say where
the harvest shall stop?
ghost house
i dwell in a lonely house i know
that vanished many a summer ago,
and left no trace but the cellar walls,
and a cellar in which the daylight falls,
and the purplestemmed wild raspberries grow
oer ruined fences the grapevines shield
the woods come back to the mowing field
the orchard tree has grown one copse
of new wood and old where the woodpecker chops
the footpath down to the well is healed
i dwell with a strangely aching heart
in that vanished abode there far apart
on that disused and forgotten road
that has no dustbath now for the toad
night comes the black bats tumble and dart
the whippoorwill is coming to shout
and hush and cluck and flutter about
i hear him begin far enough away
full many a time to say his say
before he arrives to say it out
it is under the small, dim, summer star
i know not who these mute folk are
who share the unlit place with me
those stones out under the lowlimbed tree
doubtless bear names that the mosses mar
they are tireless folk, but slow and sad,
though two, closekeeping, are lass and lad,
with none among them that ever sings,
and yet, in view of how many things,
as sweet companions as might be had
going for water
the well was dry beside the door,
and so we went with pail and can
across the fields behind the house
to seek the brook if still it ran
not loth to have excuse to go,
because the autumn eve was fair
though chill, because the fields were ours,
and by the brook our woods were there
we ran as if to meet the moon
that slowly dawned behind the trees,
the barren boughs without the leaves,
without the birds, without the breeze
but once within the wood, we paused
like gnomes that hid us from the moon,
ready to run to hiding new
with laughter when she found us soon
each laid on other a staying hand
to listen ere we dared to look,
and in the hush we joined to make
we heard, we knew we heard the brook
a note as from a single place,
a slender tinkling fall that made
now drops that floated on the pool
like pearls, and now a silver blade
goodbye, and keep cold
this saying goodbye on the edge of the dark
and cold to an orchard so young in the bark
reminds me of all that can happen to harm
an orchard away at the end of the farm
all winter, cut off by a hill from the house
i dont want it girdled by rabbit and mouse,
i dont want it dreamily nibbled for browse
by deer, and i dont want it budded by grouse
if certain it wouldnt be idle to call
id summon grouse, rabbit, and deer to the wall
and warn them away with a stick for a gun
i dont want it stirred by the heat of the sun
we made it secure against being, i hope,
by setting it out on a northerly slope
no orchards the worse for the wintriest storm
but one thing about it, it mustnt get warm
how often already youve had to be told,
keep cold, young orchard goodbye and keep cold
dread fifty above more than fifty below
i have to be gone for a season or so
my business awhile is with different trees,
less carefully nourished, less fruitful than these,
and such as is done to their wood with an axe
maples and birches and tamaracks
i wish i could promise to lie in the night
and think of an orchards arboreal plight
when slowly and nobody comes with a light
its heart sinks lower under the sod
but something has to be left to god
hannibal
was there even a cause too lost,
ever a cause that was lost too long,
or that showed with the lapse of time to vain
for the generous tears of youth and song?
home burial
he saw her from the bottom of the stairs
before she saw him she was starting down,
looking back over her shoulder at some fear
she took a doubtful step and then undid it
to raise herself and look again he spoke
advancing toward her what is it you see
from up there always?  for i want to know
she turned and sank upon her skirts at that,
and her face changed from terrified to dull
he said to gain time what is it you see?
mounting until she cowered under him
i will find out now  you must tell me, dear
she, in her place, refused him any help,
with the least stiffening of her neck and silence
she let him look, sure that he wouldnt see,
blind creature and a while he didnt see
but at last he murmured, oh and again, oh
what is it  what? she said
just that i see
you dont, she challenged tell me what it is
the wonder is i didnt see at once
i never noticed it from here before
i must be wonted to it  thats the reason
the little graveyard where my people are
so small the window frames the whole of it
not so much larger than a bedroom, is it?
there are three stones of slate and one of marble,
broadshouldered little slabs there in the sunlight
on the sidehill we havent to mind those
but i understand it is not the stones,
but the childs mound
dont, dont, dont,
dont, she cried
she withdrew, shrinking from beneath his arm
that rested on the banister, and slid downstairs
and turned on him with such a daunting look,
he said twice over before he knew himself
cant a man speak of his own child hes lost?
not you  oh, wheres my hat? oh, i dont need it
i must get out of here i must get air
i dont know rightly whether any man can
amy dont go to someone else this time
listen to me i wont come down the stairs
he sat and fixed his chin between his fists
theres something i should like to ask you, dear
you dont know how to ask it
help me, then
her fingers moved the latch for all reply
my words are nearly always an offense
i dont know how to speak of anything
so as to please you but i might be taught,
i should suppose i cant say i see how
a man must partly give up being a man
with womenfolk we could have some arrangement
by which id bind myself to keep hands off
anything special youre amind to name
though i dont like such things twixt those that love
two that dont love cant live together without them
but two that do cant live together with them
she moved the latch a little dont  dont go
dont carry it to someone else this time
tell me about it if its something human
let me into your grief im not so much
unlike other folks as your standing there
apart would make me out give me my chance
i do think, though, you overdo it a little
what was it brought you up to think it the thing
to take your motherloss of a first child
so inconsolably  in the face of love
youd think his memory might be satisfied
there you go sneering now
im not, im not
you make me angry ill come down to you
god, what a woman and its come to this,
a man cant speak of his own child thats dead
you cant because you dont know how to speak
if you had any feelings, you that dug
with your own hand  how could you?  his little grave
i saw you from that very window there,
making the gravel leap and leap in air,
leap up, like that, like that, and land so lightly
and roll back down the mound beside the hole
i thought, who is that man? i didnt know you
and i crept down the stairs and up the stairs
to look again, and still your spade kept lifting
then you came in i heard your rumbling voice
out in the kitchen, and i dont know why,
but i went near to see with my own eyes
you could sit there with the stains on your shoes
of the fresh earth from your own babys grave
and talk about your everyday concerns
you had stood the spade up against the wall
outside there in the entry, for i saw it
i shall laugh the worst laugh i ever laughed
im cursed god, if i dont believe im cursed
i can repeat the very words you were saying
three foggy mornings and one rainy day
will rot the best birch fence a man can build
think of it, talk like that at such a time
what had how long it takes a birch to rot
to do with what was in the darkened parlour?
you couldnt care the nearest friends can go
with anyone to death, comes so far short
they might as well not try to go at all
no, from the time when one is sick to death,
one is alone, and he dies more alone
friends make pretense of following to the grave,
but before one is in it, their minds are turned
and making the best of their way back to life
and living people, and things they understand
but the worlds evil i wont have grief so
if i can change it oh, i wont, i wont
there, you have said it all and you feel better
you wont go now youre crying close the door
the hearts gone out of it why keep it up?
amyl theres someone coming down the road
you  oh, you think the talk is all i must go
somewhere out of this house how can i make you
if  you  do she was opening the door wider
where do you mean to go? first tell me that
ill follow and bring you back by force i will
hyla brook
by june our brooks run out of song and speed
sought for much after that, it will be found
either to have gone groping underground
and taken with it all the hyla breed
that shouted in the mist a month ago,
like ghost of sleighbells in a ghost of snow
or flourished and come up in jewelweed,
weak foliage that is blown upon and bent
even against the way its waters went
its bed is left a faded paper sheet
of dead leaves stuck together by the heat
a brook to none but who remember long
this as it will be seen is other far
than with brooks taken otherwhere in song
we love the things we love for what they are
in a disused graveyard
the living come with grassy tread
to read the gravestones on the hill
the graveyard draws the living still,
but never anymore the dead
the verses in it say and say
the ones who living come today
to read the stones and go away
tomorrow dead will come to stay
so sure of death the marbles rhyme,
yet cant help marking all the time
how no one dead will seem to come
what is it men are shrinking from?
it would be easy to be clever
and tell the stones men hate to die
and have stopped dying now forever
i think they would believe the lie
in a poem
the sentencing goes blithely on its way
and takes the playfully objected rhyme
as surely as it takes the stroke and time
in having its undeviable say
in hardwood groves
the same leaves over and over again they fall from giving shade above to make one
texture of faded brown and fit the earth like a leather glove before the leaves can
mount again to fill the trees with another shade, they must go down past things
coming up they must go down into the dark decayed they must be pierced by
flowers and put beneath the feet of dancing flowers however it is in some other world
i know that this is way in ours
in neglect
they leave us so to the way we took, as two in whom them were proved mistaken,
that we sit sometimes in the wayside nook, with michievous, vagrant, seraphic look,
and try if we cannot feel forsaken
in white
a dented spider like a snow drop white
on a white healall, holding up a moth
like a white piece of lifeless satin cloth
saw ever curious eye so strange a sight?
portent in little, assorted death and blight
like the ingredients of a witches broth?
the beady spider, the flower like a froth,
and the moth carried like a paper kite
what had that flower to do with being white,
the blue prunella every childs delight
what brought the kindred spider to that height?
make we no thesis of the millers plight
what but design of darkness and of night?
design, design do i use the word aright?
into my own
one of my wishes is that those dark trees,
so old and firm they scarcely show the breeze,
were not, as twere, the merest mask of gloom,
but stretched away unto the edge of doom
i should not be withheld but that some day
into their vastness i should steal away,
fearless of ever finding open land,
or highway where the slow wheel pours the sand
i do not see why i should eer turn back,
or those should not set forth upon my track
to overtake me, who should miss me here
and long to know if still i held them dear
they would not find me changed from him they knew
only more sure of all i though was true
leaves compared with flowers
a trees leaves may be ever so good,
so may its bar, so may its wood
but unless you put the right thing to its root
it never will show much flower or fruit
but i may be one who does not care
ever to have tree bloom or bear
leaves for smooth and bark for rough,
leaves and bark may be tree enough
some giant trees have bloom so small
they might as well have none at all
late in life i have come on fern
now lichens are due to have their turn
i bade men tell me which in brief,
which is fairer, flower or leaf
they did not have the wit to say,
leaves by night and flowers by day
leaves and bar, leaves and bark,
to lean against and hear in the dark
petals i may have once pursued
leaves are all my darker mood
love and a question
a stranger came to the door at eve,
and he spoke the bridegroom fair
he bore a greenwhite stick in his hand,
and, for all burden, care
he asked with the eyes more than the lips
for a shelter for the night,
and he turned and looked at the road afar
without a window light
the bridegroom came forth into the porch
with, let us look at the sky,
and question what of the night to be,
stranger, you and i
the woodbine leaves littered the yard,
the woodbine berries were blue,
autumn, yes, winter was in the wind
stranger, i wish i knew
within, the bride in the dusk alone
bent over the open fire,
her face rosered with the glowing coal
and the thought of the hearts desire
the bridegroom looked at the weary road,
yet saw but her within,
and wished her heart in a case of gold
and pinned with a silver pin
the bridegroom thought it little to give
a dole of bread, a purse,
a heartfelt prayer for the poor of god,
or for the rich a curse
but whether or not a man was asked
to mar the love of two
by harboring woe in the bridal house,
the bridegroom wished he knew
meeting and passing
as i went down the hill along the wall
there was a gate i had leaned at for the view
and had just turned from when i first saw you
as you came up the hill we met but all
we did that day was mingle great and small
footprints in summer dust as if we drew
the figure of our being less that two
but more than one as yet your parasol
pointed the decimal off with one deep thrust
and all the time we talked you seemed to see
something down there to smile at in the dust
oh, it was without prejudice to me
afterward i went past what you had passed
before we met and you what i had passed
mending wall
something there is that doesnt love a wall,
that sends the frozengroundswell under it,
and spills the upper boulders in the sun
and makes gaps even two can pass abreast
the work of hunters is another thing
i have come after them and made repair
where they have left not one stone on a stone,
but they would have the rabbit out of hiding,
to please the yelping dogs the gaps i mean,
no one has seen them made or heard them made,
but at spring mendingtime we find them there
i let my neighbour know beyond the hill
and on a day we meet to walk the line
and set the wall between us once again
we keep the wall between us as we go
to each the boulders that have fallen to each
and some are loaves and some so nearly balls
we have to use a spell to make them balance
stay where you are until our backs are turned
we wear our fingers rough with handling them
oh, just another kind of outdoor game,
one on a side it comes to little more
there where it is we do not need the wall
he is all pine and i am apple orchard
my apple trees will never get across
and eat the cones under his pines, i tell him
he only says, good fences make good neighbours
spring is the mischief in me, and i wonder
if i could put a notion in his head
why do they make good neighbours? isnt it
where there are cows? but here there are no cows
before i built a wall id ask to know
what i was walling in or walling out,
and to whom i was like to give offence
something there is that doesnt love a wall,
that wants it down i could say elves to him,
but its not elves exactly, and id rather
he said it for himself i see him there
bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top
in each hand, like an oldstone savage armed
he moves in darkness as it seems to me,
not of woods only and the shade of trees
he will not go behind his fathers saying,
and he likes having thought of it so well
he says again, good fences make good neighbours
mowing
there was never a sound beside the wood but one,
and that was my long scythe whispering to the ground
what was it it whispered? i knew not well myself
perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun,
something, perhaps, about the lack of sound
and that was why it whispered and did not speak
it was no dream of the gift of idle hours,
or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf
anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak
to the earnest love that laid the swale in rows,
not without feeblepointed spikes of flowers
pale orchises, and scared a bright green snake
the fact is the sweetest dream that labour knows
my long scythe whispered and left the hay to make
my butterfly
thine emulous fond flowers are dead, too, and the daft sunassaulter, he that
frightened thee so oft, is fled or dead save only me nor is it sad to thee save only
me there is none left to mourn thee in the fields
my november guest
my sorrow, when shes here with me,
thinks these dark days of autumn rain
are beautiful as days can be
she loves the bare, the withered tree
she walks the sodden pasture lane
her pleasure will not let me stay
she talks and i am fain to list
shes glad the birds are gone away,
shes glad her simple worsted grey
is silver now with clinging mist
the desolate, deserted trees,
the faded earth, the heavy sky,
the beauties she so truly sees,
she thinks i have no eye for these,
and vexes me for reason why
not yesterday i learned to know
the love of bare november days
before the coming of the snow,
but it were vain to tell her so,
and they are better for her praise
neither out far nor in deep
the people along the sand
all turn and look one way
they turn their back on the land
they look at the sea all day
as long as it takes to pass
a ship keeps raising its hull
the wetter ground like glass
reflects a standing gull
the land may vary more
but wherever the truth may be
the water comes ashore,
and the people look at the sea
they cannot look out far
they cannot look in deep
btu when was that ever a bar
to any watch they keep?
never again would birds song be the same
he would declare and could himself believe
that the birds there in all the garden round
from having heard the daylong voice of eve
had added to their own an oversound,
her tone of meaning but without the words
admittedly an eloquence so soft
could only have had an influence on birds
when call or laughter carried it aloft
be that as may be, she was in their song
moreover her voice upon their voices crossed
had now persisted in the woods so long
that probably it never would be lost
never again would birds song be the same
and to do that to birds was why she came
not to keep
they sent him back to her the letter came
saying and she could have him and before
she could be sure there was no hidden ill
under the formal writing, he was in her sight,
living they gave him back to her alive
how else? they are not known to send the dead
and not disfigured visibly his face?
his hands? she had to look, and ask,
what was it, dear? and she had given all
and still she had all they had they the lucky
wasnt she glad now? everything seemed won,
and all the rest for them permissible ease
she had to ask, what was it, dear?
enough,
yet not enough a bullet through and through,
high in the breast nothing but what good care
and medicine and rest, and you a week,
can cure me of to go again the same
grim giving to do over for them both
she dared no more than ask him with her eyes
how was it with him for a second trial
and with his eyes he asked her not to ask
they had given him back to her, but not to keep
nothing gold can stay
natures first green is gold,
her hardest hue to hold
her early leafs a flower
but only so an hour
then leaf subsides to leaf,
so eden sank to grief,
so dawn goes down to day
nothing gold can stay
now close the windows
now close the windows and hush all the fields
if the trees must, let them silently toss
no bird is singing now, and if there is,
be it my loss
it will be long ere the marshes resume,
i will be long ere the earliest bird
so close the windows and not hear the wind,
but see all windstirred
october
o hushed october morning mild, thy leaves have ripened to the fall tomorrows wind,
if it be wild, should waste them all the crows above the forest call tomorrow they
may form and go o hushed october morning mild, begin the hours of this day slow
make the day seem to us less brief hearts not averse to being beguiled, beguile us in
the way you know release one leaf at break of day at noon release another leaf one
from our trees, one far away retard the sun with gentle mist enchant the land with
amethyst slow, slow for the grapes sake, if the were all, whose elaves already are
burnt with frost, whose clustered fruit must else be lost for the grapes sake along
the all
on a tree fallen across the road
to hear us talk
the tree the tempest with a crash of wood
throws down in front of us is not bar
our passage to our journeys end for good,
but just to ask us who we think we are
insisting always on our own way so
she likes to halt us in our runner tracks,
and make us get down in a foot of snow
debating what to do without an ax
and yet she knows obstruction is in vain
we will not be put off the final goal
we have it hidden in us to attain,
not though we have to seize earth by the pole
and, tired of aimless circling in one place,
steer straight off after something into space
on looking up by chance at the constellations
youll wait a long, long time for anything much
to happen in heaven beyond the floats of cloud
and the northern lights that run like tingling nerves
the sun and moon get crossed, but they never touch,
nor strike out fire from each other nor crash out loud
the planets seem to interfere in their curves
but nothing ever happens, no harm is done
we may as well go patiently on with our life,
and look elsewhere than to stars and moon and sun
for the shocks and changes we need to keep us sane
it is true the longest drout will end in rain,
the longest peace in china will end in strife
still it wouldnt reward the watcher to stay awake
in hopes of seeing the calm of heaven break
on his particular time and personal sight
that calm seems certainly safe to last tonight
once by the pacific
the shattered water made a misty din
great waves looked over others coming in,
and thought of doing something to the shore
that water never did to land before
the clouds were low and hairy in the skies,
like locks blown forward in the gleam of eyes
you could not tell, and yet it looked as if
the shore was lucky in being backed by cliff,
the cliff in being backed by continent
it looked as if a night of dark intent
was coming, and not only a night, an age
someone had better be prepared for rage
there would be more than oceanwater broken
before gods last put out the light was spoken
one step backward taken
not only sands and gravels
were once more on their travels,
but gulping muddy gallons
great boulders off their balance
bumped heads together dully
and started down the gully
whole capes caked off in slices
i felt my standpoint shaken
in the universal crisis
but with one step backward taken
i saved myself from going
a world torn loose went by me
then the rain stopped and the blowing,
and the sun came out to dry me
out, out
the buzzsaw snarled and rattled in the yard
and made dust and dropped stovelength sticks of wood,
sweetscented stuff when the breeze drew across it
and from there those that lifted eyes could count
five mountain ranges one behind the other
under the sunset far into vermont
and the saw snarled and rattled, snarled and rattled,
as it ran light, or had to bear a load
and nothing happened day was all but done
call it a day, i wish they might have said
to please the boy by giving him the half hour
that a boy counts so much when saved from work
his sister stood beside them in her apron
to tell them supper at that word, the saw,
as if to prove saws knew what supper meant,
leaped out at the boys hand, or seemed to leap
he must have given the hand however it was,
neither refused the meeting but the hand
the boys first outcry was a rueful laugh,
as he swung toward them holding up the hand
half in appeal, but half as if to keep
the life from spilling then the boy saw all
since he was old enough to know, big boy
doing a mans work, though a child at heart
he saw all spoiled dont let him cut my hand off
the doctor, when he comes dont let him, sister
so but the hand was gone already
the doctor put him in the dark of ether
he lay and puffed his lips out with his breath
and then  the watcher at his pulse took fright
no one believed they listened at his heart
little  less  nothing  and that ended it
no more to build on there and they, since they
were not the one dead, turned to their affairs
out, out

pan with us
pan came out of the woods one day, his skin and his hair and his eyes were gray,
the gray of the moss of walls were they, and stood in the sun and looked his fill at
wooded valley and wooded hill
plowmen
a plow, they say, to plow the snow
they cannot mean to plant it, no
unless in bitterness to mock
at having cultivated rock
provide, provide
the witch that came the withered hag
to wash the steps with pail and rag,
was once the beauty abishag,
the picture pride of hollywood
too many fall from great and good
for you to doubt the likelihood
die early and avoid the fate
or if predestined to die late,
make up your mind to die in state
make the whole stock exchange your own
if need be occupy a throne,
where nobody can call you crone
some have relied on what they knew
others on simply being true
what worked for them might work for you
no memory of having starred
atones for later disregard,
or keeps the end from being hard
better to go down dignified
with boughten friendship at your side
than none at all provide, provide
putting in the seed
you come to fetch me from my work tonight
when suppers on the table, and well see
if i can leave off burying the white
soft petals fallen from the apple tree
soft petals, yes, but not so barren quite,
mingled with these, smooth bean and wrinkled pea
and go along with you ere you lose sight
of what you came for and become like me,
slave to a springtime passion for the earth
how love burns through the putting in the seed
on through the watching for that early birth
when, just as the soil tarnishes with weed,
the sturdy seedling with arched body comes
shouldering its way and shedding the earth crumbs
rangefinding
the battle rent a cobweb diamondstrung
and cut a flower beside a ground birds nest
before it stained a single human breast
the stricken flower bent double and so hung
and still the bird revisited her young
a butterfly its fall had dispossessed
a moment sought in air his flower of rest,
then lightly stooped to it and fluttering clung
on the bare upland pasture there had spread
oernight twixt mullein stalks a wheel of thread
and straining cables wet with silver dew
a sudden passing bullet shook it dry
the indwelling spider ran to greet the fly,
but finding nothing, sullenly withdrew
reluctance
out through the fields and the woods and over the walls i have wended i have
climbed the hills of view and looked at the world, and descended i have come by the
highway home, and lo, it is ended the leaves are all dead on the group, save those
that the oak is keeping to ravel them one by one and let them go scraping and
creeping out over the crusted snow, when others are sleeping and the dead leaves
lie huddled and still, no longer blown hither and thither the last long aster is gone
the flowers of the witchhazel wither the heart is still aching to seek, but the feel
question whither? ah, when to the heart of man was it ever less than a treason to
go with the drift of things, to yield with a grace to reason, and bow and accept the end
of a love or a season?
revelation
we make ourselves a place apart
behind light words that tease and flout,
but oh, the agitated heart
till someone find us really out
tis pity if the case require
or so we say that in the end
we speak the literal to inspire
the understanding of a friend
but so with all, from babes that play
at hideandseek to god afar,
so all who hide too well away
must speak and tell us where they are
rose pogonias
a saturated meadow,
sunshaped and jewelsmall,
a circle scarcely wider
than the trees around were tall
where winds were quite excluded,
and the air was stifling sweet
with the breath of many flowers,
a temple of the heat
there we bowed us in the burning,
as the suns right worship is,
to pick where none could miss them
a thousand orchises
for though the grass was scattered,
yet every second spear
seemed tipped with wings of color,
that tinged the atmosphere
we raised a simple prayer
before we left the spot,
that in the general mowing
that place might be forgot
or if not all so favored,
obtain such grace of hours,
that none should mow the grass there
while so confused with flowers
spring pools
these pools that, though in forests, still reflect
the total sky almost without defect,
and like the flowers beside them, chill and shiver,
will like the flowers beside them soon be gone,
and yet not out by any brook or river,
but up by roots to bring dark foliage on
the trees that have it in their pentup buds
to darken nature and be summer woods
let them think twice before they use their powers
to blot out and drink up and sweep away
these flowery waters and these watery flowers
from snow that melted only yesterday
stars
how countlessly they congregate
oer our tumultuous snow,
which flows in shapes as tall as trees
when wintry winds do blow
as if with keenness for our fate,
our faltering few steps on
to white rest, and a place of rest
invisible at dawn,
and yet with neither love nor hate,
those stars like some snowwhite
minervas snowwhite marble eyes
without the gift of sight
stopping by woods on a snowy evening
whose woods these are i think i know
his house is in the village, though
he will not see me stopping here
to watch his woods fill up with snow
my little horse must think it queer
to stop without a farmhouse near
between the woods and frozen lake
the darkest evening of the year
he gives his harness bells a shake
to ask if there is some mistake
the only other sounds the sweep
of easy wind and downy flake
the woods are lovely, dark, and deep,
but i have promises to keep,
and miles to go before i sleep,
and miles to go before i sleep
the aim was song
before man to blow to right
the wind once blew itself untaught,
and did its loudest day and night
in any rough place where it caught
man came to tell it what was wrong
it hadnt found the place to blow
it blew too hard  the aim was song
and listen  how it ought to go
he took a little in his mouth,
and held it long enough for north
to be converted into south,
and then by measure blew it forth
by measure it was word and note,
the wind the wind had meant to be
a little through the lips and throat
the aim was song  the wind could see
the armful
for every parcel i stoop down to seize
i lose some other off my arms and knees,
and the whole pile is slipping, bottles, buns
extremes too hard to comprehend at once,
yet nothing i should care to leave behind
with all i have to hold with hand and mind
and heart, if need be, i will do my best
to keep their building balanced at my breast
i crouch down to prevent them as they fall
then sit down in the middle of them all
i had to drop the armful in the road
and try to stack them in a better load
the bear
the bear puts both arms around the tree above her
and draws it down as if it were a lover
and its chokecherries lips to kiss goodby,
then lets it snap back upright in the sky
her next step rocks a boulder on the wall
shes making her crosscountry in the fall
her great weight creaks the barbed wire in its staples
as she flings over and off down through the maples,
leaving on one wire tooth a lock of hair
such is the uncaged progress of the bear
the world has room to make a bear feel free
the universe seems cramped to you and me
man acts more like the poor bear in a cage,
that all day fights a nervous inward rage,
his mood rejecting all his mind suggests
he paces back and forth and never rests
the menail click and shuffle of his feet,
the telescope at one end of his beat,
and at the other end the microscope,
two instruments of nearly equal hope,
and in conjunction giving quite a spread
or if he rests from scientific tread,
tis only to sit back and sway his head
through ninetyodd degrees of arc, it seems,
between two metaphysical extremes
he sits back on his fundamental butt
with lifted snout and eyes if any shut
he almost looks religious but hes not,
and back and forth he sways from cheek to cheek,
at one extreme agreeing with one greek
at the other agreeing with another greek
which may be thought, but only so to speak
a baggy figure, equally pathetic
when sedentary and when peripatetic
the cow in appletime
something inspires the only cow of late
to make no more of a wall than an open gate,
and think no more of wallbuilders than fools
her face is flecked with pomace and she drools
a cider syrup having tasted fruit,
she scorns a pasture withering to the root
she runs from tree to tree where lie and sweeten
the windfalls spiked with stubble and wormeaten
she leaves them bitten when she has to fly
she bellows on a knoll against the sky
her udder shrivels and the milk goes dry
the death of the hired man
mary sat musing on the lampflame at the table
waiting for warren when she heard his step,
she ran on tiptoe down the darkened passage
to meet him in the doorway with the news
and put him on his guard silas is back
she pushed him outward with her through the door
and shut it after her be kind, she said
she took the market things from warrens arms
and set them on the porch, then drew him down
to sit beside her on the wooden steps
when was i ever anything but kind to him?
but ill not have the fellow back, he said
i told him so last haying, didnt i?
if he left then, i said, that ended it
what good is he? who else will harbour him
at his age for the little he can do?
what help he is theres no depending on
off he goes always when i need him most
he thinks he ought to earn a little pay,
enough at least to buy tobacco with,
so he wont have to beg and be beholden
all right, i say, i cant afford to pay
any fixed wages, though i wish i could
someone else can then someone else will have to
i shouldnt mind his bettering himself
if that was what it was you can be certain,
when he begins like that, theres someone at him
trying to coax him off with pocketmoney,
in haying time, when any help is scarce
in winter he comes back to us im done
sh not so loud hell hear you, mary said
i want him to hell have to soon or late
hes worn out hes asleep beside the stove
when i came up from rowes i found him here,
huddled against the barndoor fast asleep,
a miserable sight, and frightening, too
you neednt smilei didnt recognise him
i wasnt looking for himand hes changed
wait till you see
where did you say hed been?
he didnt say i dragged him to the house,
and gave him tea and tried to make him smoke
i tried to make him talk about his travels
nothing would do he just kept nodding off
what did he say? did he say anything?
but little
anything? mary, confess
he said hed come to ditch the meadow for me
warren
but did he? i just want to know
of course he did what would you have him say?
surely you wouldnt grudge the poor old man
some humble way to save his selfrespect
he added, if you really care to know,
he meant to clear the upper pasture, too
that sounds like something you have heard before?
warren, i wish you could have heard the way
he jumbled everything i stopped to look
two or three timeshe made me feel so queer
to see if he was talking in his sleep
he ran on harold wilsonyou remember
the boy you had in haying four years since
hes finished school, and teaching in his college
silas declares youll have to get him back
he says they two will make a team for work
between them they will lay this farm as smooth
the way he mixed that in with other things
he thinks young wilson a likely lad, though daft
on educationyou know how they fought
all through july under the blazing sun,
silas up on the cart to build the load,
harold along beside to pitch it on
yes, i took care to keep well out of earshot
well, those days trouble silas like a dream
you wouldnt think they would how some things linger
harolds young college boys assurance piqued him
after so many years he still keeps finding
good arguments he sees he might have used
i sympathise i know just how it feels
to think of the right thing to say too late
harolds associated in his mind with latin
he asked me what i thought of harolds saying
he studied latin like the violin
because he liked itthat an argument
he said he couldnt make the boy believe
he could find water with a hazel prong
which showed how much good school had ever done him
he wanted to go over that but most of all
he thinks if he could have another chance
to teach him how to build a load of hay
i know, thats silas one accomplishment
he bundles every forkful in its place,
and tags and numbers it for future reference,
so he can find and easily dislodge it
in the unloading silas does that well
he takes it out in bunches like big birds nests
you never see him standing on the hay
hes trying to lift, straining to lift himself
he thinks if he could teach him that, hed be
some good perhaps to someone in the world
he hates to see a boy the fool of books
poor silas, so concerned for other folk,
and nothing to look backward to with pride,
and nothing to look forward to with hope,
so now and never any different
part of a moon was falling down the west,
dragging the whole sky with it to the hills
its light poured softly in her lap she saw
and spread her apron to it she put out her hand
among the harplike morningglory strings,
taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves,
as if she played unheard the tenderness
that wrought on him beside her in the night
warren, she said, he has come home to die
you neednt be afraid hell leave you this time
home, he mocked gently
yes, what else but home?
it all depends on what you mean by home
of course hes nothing to us, any more
than was the hound that came a stranger to us
out of the woods, worn out upon the trail
home is the place where, when you have to go there,
they have to take you in
i should have called it
something you somehow havent to deserve
warren leaned out and took a step or two,
picked up a little stick, and brought it back
and broke it in his hand and tossed it by
silas has better claim on us you think
than on his brother? thirteen little miles
as the road winds would bring him to his door
silas has walked that far no doubt today
why didnt he go there? his brothers rich,
a somebodydirector in the bank
he never told us that
we know it though
i think his brother ought to help, of course
ill see to that if there is need he ought of right
to take him in, and might be willing to
he may be better than appearances
but have some pity on silas do you think
if hed had any pride in claiming kin
or anything he looked for from his brother,
hed keep so still about him all this time?
i wonder whats between them
i can tell you
silas is what he iswe wouldnt mind him
but just the kind that kinsfolk cant abide
he never did a thing so very bad
he dont know why he isnt quite as good
as anyone he wont be made ashamed
to please his brother, worthless though he is
i cant think si ever hurt anyone
no, but he hurt my heart the way he lay
and rolled his old head on that sharpedged chairback
he wouldnt let me put him on the lounge
you must go in and see what you can do
i made the bed up for him there tonight
youll be surprised at himhow much hes broken
his working days are done im sure of it
id not be in a hurry to say that
i havent been go, look, see for yourself
but, warren, please remember how it is
hes come to help you ditch the meadow
he has a plan you mustnt laugh at him
he may not speak of it, and then he may
ill sit and see if that small sailing cloud
will hit or miss the moon
it hit the moon
then there were three there, making a dim row,
the moon, the little silver cloud, and she
warren returnedtoo soon, it seemed to her,
slipped to her side, caught up her hand and waited
warren, she questioned
dead, was all he answered
the demiurges laugh
it was far in the sameness of the wood
i was running with joy on the demons trail,
though i knew what i hunted was no true god
it was just as the light was beginning to fail
that i suddenly heardall i needed to hear
it has lasted me many and many a year
the sound was behind me instead of before,
a sleepy sound, but mocking half,
as of one who utterly couldnt care
the demon arose from his wallow to laugh,
brushing the dirt from his eye as he went
and well i knew what the demon meant
i shall not forget how his laugh rang out
i felt as a fool to have been so caught,
and checked my steps to make pretence
it was something among the leaves i sought
though doubtful whether he stayed to see
thereafter i sat me against a tree
the exposed nest
you were forever finding some new play
so when i saw you down on hands and knees
i the meadow, busy with the newcut hay,
trying, i thought, to set it up on end,
i went to show you how to make it stay,
if that was your idea, against the breeze,
and, if you asked me, even help pretend
to make it root again and grow afresh
but twas no makebelieve with you today,
nor was the grass itself your real concern,
though i found your hand full of wilted fern,
steelbright junegrass, and blackening heads of clovers
twas a nest full of young birds on the ground
the cutterbar had just gone champing over
miraculously without tasking flesh
and left defenseless to the heat and light
you wanted to restore them to their right
of something interposed between their sight
and too much world at oncecould means be found
the way the nestfull every time we stirred
stood up to us as to a motherbird
whose coming home has been too long deferred,
made me ask would the motherbird return
and care for them in such a change of scene
and might out meddling make her more afraid
that was a thing we could not wait to learn
we saw the risk we took in doing good,
but dared not spare to do the best we could
though harm should come of it so built the screen
you had begun, and gave them back their shade
all this to prove we cared why is there then
no more to tell? we turned to other things
i havent any memoryhave you?
of ever coming to the place again
to see if the birds lived the first night through,
and so at last to learn to use their wings
the flower boat
the fishermans swapping a yarn for a yarn
under the hand of the village barber,
and her in the angle of house and barn
his deepsea dory has found a harbor
at anchor she rides the sunny sod
as full to the gunnel of flowers growing
as ever she turned her home with cod
from georges bank when winds were blowing
and i judge from that elysian freight
that all they ask is rougher weather,
and dory and master will sail by fate
to seek the happy isles together
the gift outright
the land was ours before we were the lands
she was our land more than a hundred years
before we were her people she was ours
in massachusetts, in virginia,
but we were englands, still colonials,
possessing what we still were unpossessed by,
possessed by what we now no more possessed
something we were withholding made us weak
until we found out that it was ourselves
we were withholding from our land of living,
and forthwith found salvation in surrender
such as we were we gave ourselves outright
the deed of gift was many deeds of war
to the land vaguely realizing westward,
but still unstoried, artless, unenhanced,
such as she was, such as she would become
the gumgatherer
there overtook me and drew me in
to his downhill, earlymorning stride,
and set me five miles on my road
better than if he had had me ride,
a man with a swinging bag forload
and half the bag wound round his hand
we talked like barking above the din
of water we walked along beside
and for my telling him where id been
and where i lived in mountain land
to be coming home the way i was,
he told me a little about himself
he came from higher up in the pass
where the grist of the newbeginning brooks
is blocks split off the mountain mass
and hop eless grist enough it looks
ever to grind to soil for grass
the way it is will do for moss
there he had built his stolen shack
it had to be a stolen shack
because of the fears of fire and logs
that trouble the sleep of lumber folk
visions of half the world burned black
and the sun shrunken yellow in smoke
we know who when they come to town
bring berries under the wagon seat,
or a basket of eggs between their feet
what this man brought in a cotton sack
was gum, the gum of the mountain spruce
he showed me lumps of the scented stuff
like uncut jewels, dull and rough
it comes to market golden brown
but turns to pink between the teeth
i told him this is a pleasant life
to set your breast to the bark of trees
that all your days are dim beneath,
and reaching up with a little knife,
to loose the resin and take it down
and bring it to market when you please
the hill wife
it was too lonely for her there,
and too wild,
and since there were but two of them,
and no child
and work was little in the house,
she was free,
and followed where he furrowed field,
or felled log
she rested on a log and tossed
the fresh chips,
with a song only to herself
on her lips
and once she went to break a bough
of black alder
she strayed so far she scarcely heard
when he called her
and didnt answer  didnt speak
or return
she stood, and then she ran and hid
in the fern
he never found her, though he looked
everywhere,
and he asked at her mothers house
was she there
sudden and swift and light as that
the ties gave,
and he learned of finalities
besides the grave
the linegang
here come the linegang pioneering by,
they throw a forest down less cut than broken
they plant dead trees for living, and the dead
they string together with a living thread
they string an instrument against the sky
wherein words whether beaten out or spoken
will run as hushed as when they were a thought
but in no hush they string it they go past
with shouts afar to pull the cable taught,
to hold it hard until they make it fast,
to ease away  they have it with a laugh,
an oath of towns that set the wild at naught
they bring the telephone and telegraph
the lockless door
it went many years,
but at last came a knock,
and i thought of the door
with no lock to lock
i blew out the light,
i tiptoed the floor,
and raised both hands
in prayer to the door
but the knock came again
my window was wide
i climbed on the sill
and descended outside
back over the sill
i bade a come in
to whoever the knock
at the door may have been
so at a knock
i emptied my cage
to hide in the world
and alter with age
the need of being versed in country things
the house had gone to bring again
to the midnight sky a sunset glow
now the chimney was all of the house that stood,
like a pistil after the petals go
the barn opposed across the way,
that would have joined the house in flame
had it been the will of the wind, was left
to bear forsaken the places name
no more it opened with all one end
for teams that came by the stony road
to drum on the floor with scurrying hoofs
and brush the mow with the summer load
the birds that came to it through the air
at broken windows flew out and in,
their murmur more like the sigh we sigh
from too much dwelling on what has been
yet for them the lilac renewed its leaf,
and the aged elm, though touched with fire
and the dry pump flung up an awkward arm
and the fence post carried a strand of wire
for them there was really nothing sad
but though they rejoiced in the nest they kept,
one had to be versed in country things
not to believe the phoebes wept
the oven bird
there is a singer eveyone has heard,
loud, a midsummer and a midwood bird,
who makes the solid tree trunks sound again
he says that leaves are old and that for flowers
midsummer is to spring as one to ten
he says the early petalfall is past,
when pear and cherry bloom went down in showers
on sunny days a moment overcast
and comes that other fall we name the fall
he says the highway dust is over all
the bird would cease and be as other birds
but that he knows in singing not to sing
the question that he frames in all but words
is what to make of a diminished thing
the pasture
im going out to clean the pasture spring
ill only stop to rake the leaves away
and wait to watch the water clear, i may
i shant be gone long  you come too
im going out to fetch the little calf
thats standing by the mother its so young,
it totters when she licks it with her tongue
i shant be gone long  you come too
the road not taken
two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
and sorry i could not travel both
and be one traveler, long i stood
and looked down one as far as i could
to where it bent in the undergrowth
then took the other, just as fair,
and having perhaps the better claim
because it was grassy and wanted wear,
though as for that the passing there
had worn them really about the same,
and both that morning equally lay
in leaves no step had trodden black
oh, i marked the first for another day
yet knowing how way leads on to way
i doubted if i should ever come back
i shall be telling this with a sigh
somewhere ages and ages hence
two roads diverged in a wood, and i,
i took the one less traveled by,
and that has made all the difference
the rose family
the rose is a rose,
and was always a rose
but the theory now goes
that the apples a rose,
and the pear is, and sos
the plum, i suppose
the dear only knows
what will next prove a rose
you, of course, are a rose
but were always a rose
the secret sits
we dance round in a ring and suppose,
but the secret sits in the middle and knows
the silken tent
she is as in a field of silken tent
at midday when the sunny summer breeze
has dried the dew and all its ropes relent,
so that in guys it gently sways at ease,
and its supporting central cedar pole,
that is its pinnacle to heavenward
and signifies the sureness of the soul,
seems to owe naught to any single cord,
but strictly held by none, is loosely bound
by countless silken ties of love and thought
to every thing on earth the compass round,
and only by ones going slightly taut
in the capriciousness of summer air
is of the slightlest bondage made aware
the soldier
he is that fallen lance that lies as hurled,
that lies unlifted now, come dew, come rust,
but still lies pointed as it ploughed the dust
if we who sight along it round the world,
see nothing worthy to have been its mark,
it is because like men we look too near,
forgetting that as fitted to the sphere,
our missiles always make too short an arc
they fall, they rip the grass, they intersect
the curve of earth, and striking, break their own
they make us cringe for metalpoint on stone
but this we know, the obstacle that checked
and tripped the body, shot the spirit on
further than target ever showed or shone
the sound of trees
i wonder about the trees
why do we wish to bear
forever the noise of these
more than another noise
so close to our dwelling place?
we suffer them by the day
till we lose all measure of pace,
and fixity in our joys,
and acquire a listening air
they are that that talks of going
but never gets away
and that talks no less for knowing,
as it grows wiser and older,
that now it means to stay
my feet tug at the floor
and my head sways to my shoulder
sometimes when i watch trees sway,
from the window or the door
i shall set forth for somewhere,
i shall make the reckless choice
some day when they are in voice
and tossing so as to scare
the white clouds over them on
i shall have less to say,
but i shall be gone
the span of life
the old dog barks backwards without getting up
i can remember when he was a pup
anonymous submission
the star splitter
you know orion always comes up sideways
throwing a leg up over our fence of mountains,
and rising on his hands, he looks in on me
busy outdoors by lanternlight with something
i should have done by daylight, and indeed,
after the ground is frozen, i should have done
before it froze, and a gust flings a handful
of waste leaves at my smoky lantern chimney
to make fun of my way of doing things,
or else fun of orions having caught me
has a man, i should like to ask, no rights
these forces are obliged to pay respect to?
so brad mclaughlin mingled reckless talk
of heavenly stars with huggermugger farming,
till having failed at huggermugger farming
he burned his house down for the fire insurance
and spent the proceeds on a telescope
to satisfy a lifelong curiosity
about our place among the infinities
what do you want with one of those blame things?
i asked him well beforehand dont you get one
dont call it blamed there isnt anything
more blameless in the sense of being less
a weapon in our human fight, he said
ill have one if i sell my farm to buy it
there where he moved the rocks to plow the ground
and plowed between the rocks he couldnt move,
few farms changed hands so rather than spend years
trying to sell his farm and then not selling,
he burned his house down for the fire insurance
and bought the telescope with what it came to
he had been heard to say by several
the best thing that were put here fors to see
the strongest thing thats given us to see withs
a telescope someone in every town
seems to me owes it to the town to keep one
in littleton it might as well be me
after such loose talk it was no surprise
when he did what he did and burned his house down
mean laughter went about the town that day
to let him know we werent the least imposed on,
and he could waitwed see to him tomorrow
but the first thing next morning we reflected
if one by one we counted people out
for the least sin, it wouldnt take us long
to get so we had no one left to live with
for to be social is to be forgiving
our thief, the one who does our stealing from us,
we dont cut off from coming to church suppers,
but what we miss we go to him and ask for
he promptly gives it back, that is if still
uneaten, unworn out, or undisposed of
it wouldnt do to be too hard on brad
about his telescope beyond the age
of being given one for christmas gift,
he had to take the best way he knew how
to find himself in one well, all we said was
he took a strange thing to be roguish over
some sympathy was wasted on the house,
a good oldtimer dating back along
but a house isnt sentient the house
didnt feel anything and if it did,
why not regard it as a sacrifice,
and an oldfashioned sacrifice by fire,
instead of a newfashioned one at auction?
out of a house and so out of a farm
at one stroke of a match, brad had to turn
to earn a living on the concord railroad,
as underticketagent at a station
where his job, when he wasnt selling tickets,
was setting out, up track and down, not plants
as on a farm, but planets, evening stars
that varied in their hue from red to green
he got a good glass for six hundred dollars
his new job gave him leisure for stargazing
often he bid me come and have a look
up the brass barrel, velvet black inside,
at a star quaking in the other end
i recollect a night of broken clouds
and underfoot snow melted down to ice,
and melting further in the wind to mud
bradford and i had out the telescope
we spread our two legs as we spread its three,
pointed our thoughts the way we pointed it,
and standing at our leisure till the day broke,
said some of the best things we ever said
that telescope was christened the starsplitter,
because it didnt do a thing but split
a star in two or three, the way you split
a globule of quicksilver in your hand
with one stroke of your finger in the middle
its a starsplitter if there ever was one,
and ought to do some good if splitting stars
sa thing to be compared with splitting wood
weve looked and looked, but after all where are we?
do we know any better where we are,
and how it stands between the night tonight
and a man with a smoky lantern chimney?
how different from the way it ever stood?
the telephone
when i was just as far as i could walk from here today, there was an hour all still
when leaning with my head again a flower i heard you talk dont say i didnt, for i
heard you say you spoke from that flower on the window sill do you remember what
it was you said? first tell me what it was you thought you heard having found the
flower and driven a bee away, i leaned on my head and holding by the stalk, i listened
and i thought i caught the word what was it? did you call me by my name? or did
you say someone said come  i heard it as i bowed i may have thought as
much, but not aloud well, so i came
the trial by existence
even the bravest that are slain shall not dissemble their surprise on waking to find
valor reign, even as on earth, in paradise and where they sought without the sword
wide fields of asphodel foreer, to find that the utmost reward of daring should be
still to dare
the tuft of flowers
i went to turn the grass once after one
who mowed it in the dew before the sun
the dew was gone that made his blade so keen
before i came to view the levelled scene
i looked for him behind an isle of trees
i listened for his whetstone on the breeze
but he had gone his way, the grass all mown,
and i must be, as he had been,alone,
as all must be, i said within my heart,
whether they work together or apart
but as i said it, swift there passed me by
on noiseless wing a bewildered butterfly,
seeking with memories grown dim over night
some resting flower of yesterdays delight
and once i marked his flight go round and round,
as where some flower lay withering on the ground
and then he flew as far as eye could see,
and then on tremulous wing came back to me
i thought of questions that have no reply,
and would have turned to toss the grass to dry
but he turned first, and led my eye to look
at a tall tuft of flowers beside a brook,
a leaping tongue of bloom the scythe had spared
beside a reedy brook the scythe had bared
i left my place to know them by their name,
finding them butterflyweed when i came
the mower in the dew had loved them thus,
by leaving them to flourish, not for us,
nor yet to draw one thought of ours to him,
but from sheer morning gladness at the brim
the butterfly and i had lit upon,
nevertheless, a message from the dawn,
that made me hear the wakening birds around,
and hear his long scythe whispering to the ground,
and feel a spirit kindred to my own
so that henceforth i worked no more alone
but glad with him, i worked as with his aid,
and weary, sought at noon with him the shade
and dreaming, as it were, held brotherly speech
with one whose thought i had not hoped to reach
men work together, i told him from the heart,
whether they work together or apart
the vanishing red
he is said to have been the last red man
in action and the miller is said to have laughed
if you like to call such a sound a laugh
but he gave no one else a laughers license
for he turned suddenly grave as if to say,
whose business,if i take it on myself,
whose businessbut why talk round the barn?
when its just that i hold with getting a thing done with
you cant get back and see it as he saw it
its too long a story to go into now
youd have to have been there and lived it
they you wouldnt have looked on it as just a matter
of who began it between the two races
some guttural exclamation of surprise
the red man gave in poking about the mill
over the great big thumping shuffling millstone
disgusted the miller physically as coming
from one who had no right to be heard from
come, john, he said, you want to see the wheelpint?
he took him down below a cramping rafter,
and showed him, through a manhole in the floor,
the water in desperate straits like frantic fish,
salmon and sturgeon, lashing with their tails
the he shut down the trap door with a ring in it
that jangled even above the general noise,
and came upstairs aloneand gave that laugh,
and said something to a man with a mealsack
that the man with the mealsack didnt catchthen
oh, yes, he showed john the wheelpit all right
the vantage point
if tires of trees i seek again mankind, well i know where to hie mein the dawn, to a
slope where the cattle keep the lawn there amid loggin juniper reclined, myself
unseen, i see in white defined far off the homes of men, and farther still, the graves
of men on an opposing hill, living or dead, whichever are to mind and if by noon i
have too much of these, i have but to turn on my arm, and lo, the sunburned hillside
sets my face aglow, my breathing shakes the bluet like a breeze, i smell the earth, i
smell the bruisegraved plant, i look into the crater of the ant
the woodpile
out walking in the frozen swamp one gray day,
i paused and said, i will turn back from here
no, i will go on farther  and we shall see
the hard snow held me, save where now and then
one foot went through the view was all in lines
straight up and down of tall slim trees
too much alike to mark or name a place by
so as to say for certain i was here
or somewhere else i was just far from home
a small bird flew before me he was careful
to put a tree between us when he lighted,
and say no word to tell me who he was
who was so foolish as to think what he thought
he thought that i was after him for a feather
the white one in his tail like one who takes
everything said as personal to himself
one flight out sideways would have undeceived him
and then there was a pile of wood for which
i forgot him and let his little fear
carry him off the way i might have gone,
without so much as wishing him goodnight
he went behind it to make his last stand
it was a cord of maple, cut and split
and piled  and measured, four by four by eight
and not another like it could i see
no runner tracks in this years snow looped near it
and it was older sure than this years cutting,
or even last years or the years before
the wood was gray and the bark warping off it
and the pile somewhat sunken clematis
had wound strings round and round it like a bundle
what held it though on one side was a tree
still growing, and on one a stake and prop,
these latter about to fall i thought that only
someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks
could so forget his handiwork on which
he spent himself, the labor of his ax,
and leave it there far from a useful fireplace
to warm the frozen swamp as best it could
with the slow smokeless burning of decay
they were welcome to their belief
grief may have thought it was grief
care may have thought it was care
they were welcome to their belief,
the overimportant pair
no, it took all the snows that clung
to the low roof over his bed,
beginning when he was young,
to induce the one snow on his head
but whenever the roof camme white
the head in the dark below
was a shade less the color of night,
a shade more the color of snow
grief may have thought it was grief
care may have thought it was care
but neither one was the thief
of his raven color of hair

to earthward
love at the lips was touch
as sweet as i could bear
and once that seemed too much
i lived on air
that crossed me from sweet things,
the flow of  was it musk
from hidden grapevine springs
down hill at dusk?
i had the swirl and ache
from sprays of honeysuckle
that when theyre gathered shake
dew on the knuckle
i craved strong sweets, but those
seemed strong when i was young
the petal of the rose
it was that stung
now no joy but lacks salt
that is not dashed with pain
and weariness and fault
i crave the stain
of tears, the aftermark
of almost too much love,
the sweet of bitter bark
and burning clove
when stiff and sore and scarred
i take away my hand
from leaning on it hard
in grass and sand,
the hurt is not enough
i long for weight and strength
to feel the earth as rough
to all my length
to the thawing wind
come with rain o loud southwester bring the singer, bring the nester give the
buried flower a dream make the settled snowbank steam find the brown beneath the
white but whateer you do tonight, bath my window, make it flow, melt it as the ice
will go melt the glass and leave the sticks like a hermits crucifix burst into my
narrow stall swing the picture on the wall run the rattling pages oer scatter poems
on the floor turn the poet out of door
tree at my window
tree at my window, window tree,
my sash is lowered when night comes on
but let there never be curtain drawn
between you and me
vague dream head lifted out of the ground,
and thing next most diffuse to cloud,
not all your light tongues talking aloud
could be profound
but tree, i have seen you taken and tossed,
and if you have seen me when i slept,
you have seen me when i was taken and swept
and all but lost
that day she put our heads together,
fate had her imagination about her,
your head so much concerned with outer,
mine with inner, weather
two look at two
love and forgetting might have carried them
a little further up the mountain side
with night so near, but not much further up
they must have halted soon in any case
with thoughts of a path back, how rough it was
with rock and washout, and unsafe in darkness
when they were halted by a tumbled wall
with barbedwire binding they stood facing this,
spending what onward impulse they still had
in one last look the way they must not go,
on up the failing path, where, if a stone
or earthslide moved at night, it moved itself
no footstep moved it this is all, they sighed,
goodnight to woods but not so there was more
a doe from round a spruce stood looking at them
across the wall, as near the wall as they
she saw them in their field, they her in hers
the difficulty of seeing what stood still,
like some upended boulder split in two,
was in her clouded eyes they saw no fear there
she seemed to think that two thus they were safe
then, as if they were something that, though strange,
she could not trouble her mind with too long,
she sighed and passed unscared along the wall
this, then, is all what more is there to ask?
but no, not yet a snort to bid them wait
a buck from round the spruce stood looking at them
across the wall as near the wall as they
this was an antlered buck of lusty nostril,
not the same doe come back into her place
he viewed them quizzically with jerks of head,
as if to ask, why dont you make some motion?
or give some sign of life? because you cant
i doubt if youre as living as you look
thus till he had them almost feeling dared
to stretch a proffering hand  and a spellbreaking
then he too passed unscared along the wall
two had seen two, whichever side you spoke from
this must be all it was all still they stood,
a great wave from it going over them,
as if the earth in one unlookedfor favour
had made them certain earth returned their love
two tramps in mud time
out of the mud two strangers came
and caught me splitting wood in the yard,
and one of them put me off my aim
by hailing cheerily hit them hard
i knew pretty well why he had dropped behind
and let the other go on a way
i knew pretty well what he had in mind
he wanted to take my job for pay
good blocks of oak it was i split,
as large around as the chopping block
and every piece i squarely hit
fell splinterless as a cloven rock
the blows that a life of selfcontrol
spares to strike for the common good,
that day, giving a loose my soul,
i spent on the unimportant wood
the sun was warm but the wind was chill
you know how it is with an april day
when the sun is out and the wind is still,
youre one month on in the middle of may
but if you so much as dare to speak,
a cloud comes over the sunlit arch,
a wind comes off a frozen peak,
and youre two months back in the middle of march
a bluebird comes tenderly up to alight
and turns to the wind to unruffle a plume,
his song so pitched as not to excite
a single flower as yet to bloom
it is snowing a flake and he half knew
winter was only playing possum
except in color he isnt blue,
but he wouldnt advise a thing to blossom
the water for which we may have to look
in summertime with a witching wand,
in every wheelruts now a brook,
in every print of a hoof a pond
be glad of water, but dont forget
the lurking frost in the earth beneath
that will steal forth after the sun is set
and show on the water its crystal teeth
the time when most i loved my task
the two must make me love it more
by coming with what they came to ask
youd think i never had felt before
the weight of an axhead poised aloft,
the grip of earth on outspread feet,
the life of muscles rocking soft
and smooth and moist in vernal heat
out of the wood two hulking tramps
from sleeping god knows where last night,
but not long since in the lumber camps
they thought all chopping was theirs of right
men of the woods and lumberjacks,
they judged me by their appropriate tool
except as a fellow handled an ax
they had no way of knowing a fool
nothing on either side was said
they knew they had but to stay their stay
and all their logic would fill my head
as that i had no right to play
with what was another mans work for gain
my right might be love but theirs was need
and where the two exist in twain
theirs was the better rightagreed
but yield who will to their separation,
my object in living is to unite
my avocation and my vocation
as my two eyes make one in sight
only where love and need are one,
and the work is play for mortal stakes,
is the deed ever really done
for heaven and the futures sakes
conversation among the ruins
through portico of my elegant house you stalk
with your wild furies, disturbing garlands of fruit
and the fabulous lutes and peacocks, rending the net
of all decorum which holds the whirlwind back
now, rich order of walls is fallen rooks croak
above the appalling ruin in bleak light
of your stormy eye, magic takes flight
like a daunted witch, quitting castle when real days break
fractured pillars frame prospects of rock
while you stand heroic in coat and tie, i sit
composed in grecian tunic and psycheknot,
rooted to your black look, the play turned tragic
with such blight wrought on our bankrupt estate,
what ceremony of words can patch the havoc ?
winter landscape, with rooks
water in the millrace, through a sluice of stone,
plunges headlong into that black pond
where, absurd and outofseason, a single swan
floats chaste as snow, taunting the clouded mind
which hungers to haul the white reflection down
the austere sun descends above the fen,
an orange cyclopseye, scorning to look
longer on this landscape of chagrin
feathered dark in thought, i stalk like a rook,
brooding as the winter night comes on
last summers reeds are all engraved in ice
as is your image in my eye dry frost
glazes the window of my hurt what solace
can be struck from rock to make hearts waste
grow green again ? whod walk in this bleak place ?

there is a panther stalks me down
one day ill have my death of him
his greed has set the woods aflame,
he prowls more lordly than the sun
most soft, most suavely glides that step,
advancing always at my back
from gaunt hemlock, rooks croak havoc
the hunt is on, and sprung the trap
flayed by thorns i trek the rocks,
haggard through the hot white noon
along red network of his veins
what fires run, what craving wakes ?
insatiate, he ransacks the land
condemned by our ancestral fault,
crying blood, let blood be spilt
meat must glut his mouths raw wound
keen the rending teeth and sweet
the singeing fury of his fur
his kisses parch, each paws a briar,
doom consummates that appetite
in the wake of this fierce cat,
kindled like torches for his joy,
charred and ravened women lie,
become his starving bodys bait
now hills hatch menace, spawning shade
midnight cloaks the sultry grove
the black marauder, hauled by love

on fluent haunches, keeps my speed
behind snarled thickets of my eyes
lurks the lithe one in dreams ambush
bright those claws that mar the flesh
and hungry, hungry, those taut thighs
his ardor snares me, lights the trees,
and i run flaring in my skin
what lull, what cool can lap me in
when burns and brands that yellow gaze?
i hurl my heart to halt his pace,
to quench his thirst i squander blood
he eats, and still his need seeks food,
compels a total sacrifice
his voice waylays me, spells a trance,
the gutted forest falls to ash
appalled by secret want, i rush
from such assault of radiance
entering the tower of my fears,
i shut my doors on that dark guilt,
i bolt the door, each door i bolt
blood quickens, gonging in my ears
the panthers tread is on the stairs,
coming up and up the stairs

bucolics
mayday two came to field in such wise
a daisied mead, each said to each,
so were they one so sought they couch,
across barbed stile, through flocked brown cows
no pitchforked farmer, please, she said
may cockcrow guard us safe, said he
by blackthorn thicket, flower spray
they pitched their coats, come to green bed
i
below a fen where water stood
aslant their hill of stinging nettle
then, honorbound, mute grazing cattle
above leafwraithed white air, white cloud
all afternoon these lovers lay
until the sun turned pale from warm,
until sweet wind changed tune, blew harm
cruel nettles stung her ankles raw
rueful, most vexed, that tender skin
should accept so fell a wound,
he stamped and cracked stalks to the ground
which had caused his dear girl pain
now he goes from his rightful road
and, under honor, will depart
while she stands burning, venomgirt,
in wait for sharper smart to fade

tale of a tub
the photographic chamber of the eye
records bare painted walls, while an electric light
flays the chromium nerves of plumbing raw
such poverty assaults the ego caught
naked in the merely actual room,
the stranger in the lavatory mirror
puts on a public grin, repeats our name
but scrupulously reflects the usual terror
just how guilty are we when the ceiling
reveals no cracks that can be decoded ? when washbowl
maintains it has no more holy calling
than physical ablution, and the towel
dryly disclaims that fierce troll faces lurk
in its explicit folds ? or when the window,
blind with steam, will not admit the dark
which shrouds our prospects in ambiguous shadow ?

twenty years ago, the familiar tub
bred an ample batch of omens but now
water faucets spawn no danger each crab
and octopusscrabbling just beyond the view,
waiting for some accidental break
in ritual, to strikeis definitely gone
the authentic sea denies them and will pluck
fantastic flesh down to the honest bone
we take the plunge under water our limbs
waver, faintly green, shuddering away
from the genuine color of skin can our dreams
ever blur the intransigent lines which draw
the shape that shuts us in ? absolute fact
intrudes even when the revolted eye
is closed the tub exists behind our back
its glittering surfaces are blank and true
yet always the ridiculous nude flanks urge
the fabrication of some cloth to cover
such starkness accuracy must not stalk at large
each day demands we create our whole world over,
disguising the constant horror in a coat
of manycolored fictions we mask our past
in the green of eden, pretend futures shining fruit
can sprout from the navel of this present waste
in this particular tub, two knees jut up
like icebergs, while minute brown hairs rise
on arms and legs in a fringe of kelp green soap
navigates the tidal slosh of seas
breaking on legendary beaches in faith
we shall board our imagined ship and wildly sail
among sacred islands of the mad till death
shatters the fabulous stars and makes us real


southern sunrise
color of lemon, mango, peach,
these storybook villas
still dream behind
shutters, their balconies
fine as hand
made lace, or a leafandflower pensketch
tilting with the winds,
on arrowy stems,
pineapplebarked,
a green crescent of palms
sends up its forked
firework of fronds
a quartzclear dawn
inch by bright inch
gilds all our avenue,
and out of the blue drench
of angels bay
rises the round red watermelon sun
channel crossing
on stormstruck deck, wind sirens caterwaul
with each tilt, shock and shudder, our blunt ship
cleaves forward into fury dark as anger,
waves wallop, assaulting the stubborn hull
flayed by spray, we take the challenge up,
grip the rail, squint ahead, and wonder how much longer
such force can last but beyond, the neutral view
shows, rank on rank, the hungry seas advancing
below, rocked havocsick, voyagers lie
retching in bright orange basins a refugee
sprawls, hunched in black, among baggage, wincing
under the strict mask of his agony
i
far from the sweet stench of that perilous air
in which our comrades are betrayed, we freeze
and marvel at the smashing nonchalance
of nature what better way to test taut fiber
than against this onslaught, these casual blasts of ice
that wrestle with us like angels the mere chance
of making harbor through this racketing flux
taunts us to valor blue sailors sang that our journey
would be full of sun, white gulls, and water drenched
with radiance, peacockcolored instead, bleak rocks
jutted early to mark our going, while sky
curded over with clouds and chalk cliffs blanched
in sullen light of the inauspicious day
now, free, by hazards quirk, from the common ill
knocking our brothers down, we strike a stance
most mockheroic, to cloak our waking awe
at this rare rumpus which no man can control
meek and proud both fall stark violence
lays all walls waste private estates are torn,
ransacked in the public eye we forsake
our lone luck now, compelled by bond, by blood,
to keep some unsaid pact perhaps concern
is helpless here, quite extra, yet we must make
the gesture, bend and hold the prone mans head
and so we sail toward cities, streets and homes
of other men, where statues celebrate
brave acts played out in peace, in war all dangers
end green shores appear we assume our names,
our luggage, as docks halt our brief epic no debt
survives arrival we walk the plank with strangers

prospect
among orangetile rooftops
and chimney pots
the fen fog slips,
gray as rats,
while on spotted branch
of the sycamore
two black rooks hunch
and darkly glare,
watching for night,
with absinthe eye
cocked on the lone, late,
passerby
the queens complaint
in ruck and quibble of courtfolk
this giant hulked, i tell you, on her scene
with hands like derricks,
looks fierce and black as rooks
why, all the windows broke when he stalked in
her dainty acres he ramped through
and used her gentle doves with manners rude
i do not know
what fury urged him slay
her antelope who meant him naught but good
she spoke most chiding in his ear
till he some pity took upon her crying
of rich attire
he made her shoulders bare
and solaced her, but quit her at cocks crowing

a hundred heralds she sent out
to summon in her slight all doughty men
whose force might fit
shape of her sleep, her thought
none of that greenhorn lot matched her bright crown
so she is come to this rare pass
whereby she treks in blood through sun and squall
and sings you thus
how sad, alas, it is
to see my people shrunk so small, so small

he hauls to his will early
at his hands staunch hest, birds build

born green we were
to this flawed garden,
but in speckled thickets, warted as a toad,
spitefully skulks our warden,
fixing his snare
which hauls down buck, cock, trout, till all most fair
is tricked to falter in spilt blood
now our whole tasks to hack
some angelshape worth wearing
from his crabbed midden where alls wrought so awry
that no straight inquiring
could unlock
shrewd catch silting our each bright act back
to unmade mud cloaked by sour sky
sweet salts warped stem
of weeds we tackle towards ways rank ending
scorched by red sun
we heft globed flint, racked in veins barbed bindings
brave love, dream
not of staunching such strict flame, but come,
lean to my wound burn on, burn on
song for a summers day
through fen and farmland walking
with my own country love
i saw slow flocked cows move

white hulks on their days cruising
sweet grass sprang for their grazing
the air was bright for looking
most far in blue, aloft,
clouds steered a burnished drift
larks nip and tuck arising
came in for my loves praising
sheen of the noon sun striking
took my heart as if
it were a greentipped leaf
kindled by my loves pleasing
into an ardent blazing
and so, together, talking,
through sundays honeyair
we walked and still walk there
out of the suns bruising
till the night mists came rising

two sisters of persephone
two girls there are within the house
one sits the other, without
daylong a duet of shade and light
plays between these
in her dark wainscoted room
the first works problems on
a mathematical machine
dry ticks mark time
as she calculates each sum
at this barren enterprise
ratshrewd go her squint eyes,
rootpale her meager frame
ibronzed as earth, the second lies,
hearing ticks blown gold
like pollen on bright air lulled
near a bed of poppies,
she sees how their red silk flare
of petaled blood
burns open to suns blade
on that green altar
freely become suns bride, the latter
grows quick with seed
grasscouched in her labors pride,
she bears a king turned bitter
and sallow as any lemon,
the other, wry virgin to the last,
goes graveward with flesh laid waste,
wormhusbanded, yet no woman

vanity fair
through frostthick weather
this witch sidles, fingers crooked, as if
caught in a hazardous medium that might
merely by its continuing
attach her to heaven
at eyes envious corner
crowsfeet copy veining on stained leaf
cold squint steals skys color while bruit
of bells calls holy ones, her tongue
backtalks at the raven
cleaving furred air
over her skulls midden no knife
rivals her whetted look, divining what conceit
waylays simple girls, churchgoing,
and what hearts oven
i
craves most to cook batter
rich in strayings with every amorous oaf,
ready, for a trinket,
to squander owlhours on bracken bedding,
flesh unshriven
against virgin prayer
this sorceress sets mirrors enough
to distract beautys thought
lovesick at first fond song,
each vain girls driven
to believe beyond hearts flare
no fire is, nor in any book proof
sun hoists soul up after lids fall shut
so she wills all to the black king
the worst sloven
vies with best queen over
right to blaze as satans wife
housed in earth, those million brides shriek out
some burn short, some long,
staked in prides coven
is
strumpet song
with white frost gone
and all green dreams not worth much,
after a lean days work
time comes round for that foul slut
mere bruit of her takes our street
until every man,
red, pale or dark,
veers to her slouch
mark, i cry, that mouth
made to do violence on,
that seamed face
askew with blotch, dint, scar

struck by each dour year
walks there not some such one man
as can spare breath
to patch with brand of love this rank grimace
which out from black tarn, ditch and cup
into my most chaste own eyes
looks up

tinker jack and the tidy wives
come lady, bring that pot
gone black of polish
and whatever pan this mending master
should trim back to shape
ill correct each mar
on silver dish,
and shine that kettle of copper
at your fireside
bright as blood
come lady, bring that face
fallen from luster
times soot in bleared eye
can be made to glister
for small charge
no forms gone so awry,
crookback or bandyleg,
but tinker jack can forge
beauty from hag
whatever scath
fierce fires wrought
jack will touch up
and fit for use
what scars been knocked
into cracked heart
jack shall repair

and if there be
young wives still blithe,
still fair,
whose labors not yet smoked
their fine skin sere,
from their white heat
before he part
let jack catch fire
faun
haunched like a faun, he hooed
from grove of moonglint and fenfrost
until all owls in the twigged forest
flapped black to look and brood
on the call this man made
no sound but a drunken coot
lurching home along river bank
stars hung watersunk, so a rank
of double stareyes lit
boughs where those owls sat
an arena of yellow eyes
watched the changing shape he cut,
saw hoof harden from foot, saw sprout
goathorns marked how god rose
and galloped woodward in that guise
street song
by a mad miracle i go intact
among the common rout
thronging sidewalk, street,
and bickering shops
nobody blinks a lid, gapes,
or cries that this raw flesh

reeks of the butchers cleaver,
its heart and guts hung hooked
and bloodied as a cows split frame
parceled out by whitejacketed assassins
oh no, for i strut it clever
as a greenly escaped idiot,
buying wine, bread,
yellowcasqued chrysanthemums
arming myself with the most reasonable items
to ward off, at all cost, suspicions
roused by thorned hands, feet, head,
and that great wound
squandering red
from the flayed side
even as my each mangled nerveend
trills its hurt out
above pitch of pedestrian ear,
so, perhaps i, knelled dumb by your absence,
alone can hear
suns parched scream,
every downfall and crash
of gutted star,
and, more daft than any goose,
this cracked worlds incessant gabble and hiss

letter to a purist
that grandiose colossus who
stood astride
the envious assaults of sea
essaying, wave by wave,
tide by tide,
to undo him, perpetually,
has nothing on you,
o my loxe y
i
o my great idiot, who
with one foot
caught as it were in the mucktrap
of skin and bone,
dithers with the other way out
in preposterous provinces of the madcap
cloudcuckoo,
agawp at the impeccable moon
soliloquy of the solipsist
i?
i walk alone
the midnight street
spins itself from under my feet
when my eyes shut
these dreaming houses all snuff out
through a whim of mine
over gables the moons celestial onion
hangs high
i
make houses shrink
and trees diminish
by going far my looks leash
dangles the puppetpeople
who, unaware how they dwindle,
laugh, kiss, get drunk,
nor guess that if i choose to blink
they die
i
when in good humor,
give grass its green
blazon sky blue, and endow the sun
with gold
yet, in my wintriest moods, i hold
absolute power
to boycott color and forbid any flower
to be
i
know you appear
vivid at my side,
denying you sprang out of my head,
claiming you feel
love fiery enough to prove flesh real,
though its quite clear
all your beauty, all your wit, is a gift, my dear,

dialogue between ghost and priest
in the rectory garden on his evening walk
paced brisk father shawn a cold day, a sodden one it was
in black november after a sliding rain
dew stood in chill sweat on each stalk,
each thorn spiring from wet earth, a blue haze
hung caught in darkwebbed branches like a fabulous heron
hauled sudden from solitude,
hair prickling on his head,
father shawn perceived a ghost
shaping itself from that mist
how now, father shawn crisply addressed the ghost
wavering there, gauzeedged, smelling of woodsmoke,
what manner of business are you on ?
from your blue pallor, id say you inhabited the frozen waste
of hell, and not the fiery part yet to judge by that dazzled look,
that noble mien, perhaps youve late quitted heaven?
in voice furred with frost,
ghost said to priest
neither of those countries do i frequent
earth is my haunt

come, come, father shawn gave an impatient shrug,
i dont ask you to spin some ridiculous fable
of gilded harps or gnawing fire simply tell
after your lifes end, what just epilogue
god ordained to follow up your days is it such trouble
to satisfy the questions of a curious old fool?
in life, love gnawed my skin
to this white bone
what love did then, love does now
gnaws me through
what love, asked father shawn, but too great love
of flawed earthflesh could cause this sorry pass ?
some damned condition you are in
thinking never to have left the world, you grieve
as though alive, shriveling in torment thus
to atone as shade for sin that lured blind man
the day of doom
is not yet come
until that time
a crock of dust is my dear home
fond phantom, cried shocked father shawn,
can there be such stubbornness
a soul grown feverish, clutching its dead bodytree
like a last stormcrossed leaf? best get you gone
to judgment in a higher court of grace
repent, depart, before gods trumpcrack splits the sky
from that pale mist
ghost swore to priest
there sits no higher court
than mans red heart

the glutton
he, hungerstung, hard to slake,
so fitted is for my black luck
with heat such as no man could have
and yet keep kind
that all merits in being meat
seasoned how hed most approve
bloods broth,
filched by his hand,
choice wassail makes, cooked hot,
cupped quick to mouth
though prime parts cram each rich meal,
hell not spare
nor scant his want until
sacked larders gone bonebare
monologue at  am
better that every fiber crack
and fury make head,
blood drenching vivid
couch, carpet, floor
and the snakefigured almanac
vouching you are
a million green counties from here,
than to sit mute, twitching so
under prickling stars,
with stare, with curse
blackening the time
goodbyes were said, trains let go,
and i, great magnanimous fool, thus wrenched from
my one kingdom
i
miss drake proceeds to supper
no novice
in those elaborate rituals
which allay the malice
of knotted table and crooked chair,
the new woman in the ward
wears purple, steps carefully
among her secret combinations of eggshells
and breakable hummingbirds,
footing sallow as a mouse
between the cabbageroses
which are slowly opening their furred petals
to devour and drag her down
into the carpets design
with birdquick eye cocked askew
she can see in the nick of time
how perilous needles grain the floorboards
and outwit their brambled plan
now through her ambushed air,
adazzle with bright shards
of broken glass,
she edges with wary breath,
fending off jag and tooth,
until, turning sideways,
she lifts one webbed foot after the other
into the still, sultry weather
of the patients dining room
recantation
tea leaves ive given up,
and that crooked line
on the queens palm
is no more my concern
on my black pilgrimage
this moonpocked crystal ball
will break before it help
i
rather than croak out
whats to come,
my darling ravens are flown
forswear those freezing tricks of sight
and all else ive taught
against the flower in the blood
not wealth nor wisdom stands
above the simple vein,
the straight mouth
go to your greenhorn youth
before time ends
and do good
with your white hands

t h e shrike
when night comes black
such royal dreams beckon this man
as lift him apart
from his earthwifes side
to wing, sleepfeathered,
the singular air,
while she, envious bride,
cannot follow after, but lies
with her blank brown eyes starved wide,
twisting curses in the tangled sheet
with taloned fingers,
shaking in her skulls cage
the stuffed shape of her flown mate
escaped among moonplumaged strangers
so hungered, she must wait in rage
until birdracketing dawn
when her shrikeface
leans to peck open those locked lids, to eat
crowns, palace, all
that nightlong stole her male,
and with red beak
spike and suck out
last blooddrop of that truant heart


alicante lullaby
in alicante they bowl the barrels
bumblingly over the nubs of the cobbles
past the yellowpaella eateries,
below the ramshackle backalley balconies,
while the cocks and hens
in the roofgardens
scuttle repose with crowns and cackles
kumquatcolored trolleys ding as they trundle
passengers under an indigo fizzle
needling spumily down from the wires
alongside the sibilant harbor the lovers
hear loudspeakers boom
from each neonlit palm
rumbas and sambas no earflaps can muffle
o cacophony, goddess of jazz and of quarrels,
crackthroated mistress of bagpipes and cymbals,
let be your con brios, your capricciosos,
crescendos, cadenzas, prestos and prestissimos,
my head on the pillow
piano, pianissimo
lullayed by susurrous lyres and viols

dream with clamdiggers
this dream budded bright with leaves around the edges,
its clear air winnowed by angels she was come
back to her early seatown home
scathed, stained after tedious pilgrimages
barefoot, she stood, in shock of that returning,
beside a neighbors house
with shingles burnished as glass,
blinds lowered on that hot morning
ib
no change met her garden terrace, all summer
tanged by melting tar,
sloped seaward to plunge in blue fed by white fire,
the whole scene flared welcome to this roamer
high against heaven, gulls went wheeling soundless
over tidalflats where three children played
silent and shining on a green rock bedded in mud,
their fabulous heyday endless
with green rock gliding, a delicate schooner
decked forth in cockleshells,
they sailed till tide foamed round their ankles
and the fair ship sank, its crew knelled home for dinner
plucked back thus sudden to that far innocence,
she, in her shabby travel garb, began
walking eager toward water, when there, one by one,
clamdiggers rose up out of dark slime at her offense
grim as gargoyles from years spent squatting at seas border
in wait amid snarled weed and wrack of wave
to trap this wayward girl at her first move of love,
now with stake and pitchfork they advance, flint eyes fixed on murder

wreath for a bridal
what though green leaves only witness
such pact as is made once only what matter
that owl voice sole yes, while cows utter
low moos of approve let sun surpliced in brightness
stand stock still to laud these mated ones
whose stark act all coming double luck joins
couched daylong in cloisters of stinging nettle
they lie, cutgrass assaulting each separate sense
with savor coupled so, pure paragons of constance,
this pair seek single state from that dual battle
now speak some sacrament to parry scruple
for wedlock wrought within loves proper chapel

call here with flying colors all watchful birds
to people the twigged aisles lead babel tongues
of animals to choir look what thresh of wings
wields guard of honor over these starred with words
let night bless that luckrooted mead of clover
where, bedded like angels, two burn one in fever
from this holy day on, all pollen blown
shall strew broadcast so rare a seed on wind
that every breath, thus teeming, set the land
sprouting fruit, flowers, children most fair in legion
to slay spawn of dragons teeth speaking this promise,
let flesh be knit, and each step hence go famous
epitaph for fire and flower
you might as well haul up
this waves green peak on wire
to prevent fall, or anchor the fluent air
in quartz, as crack your skull to keep
these two most perishable lovers from the touch
that will kindle angels envy, scorch and drop
their fond hearts charred as any match
seek no stony cameraeye to fix
the passing dazzle of each face
in black and white, or put on ice
mouths instant flare for future looks
stars shoot their petals, and suns run to seed,
however you may sweat to hold such darling wrecks
hived like honey in your head
now in the crux of their vows hang your ear,
still as a shell hear what an age of glass
these lovers prophesy to lock embrace
secure in museum diamond for the stare
of astounded generations they wrestle
to conquer cinders kingdom in the stroke of an hour
and hoard faith safe in a fossil
but though theyd rivet sinews in rock
and have every weathercock kiss hang fire
as if to outflame a phoenix, the moments spur
drives nimble blood too quick
for a wish to tether they ride nightlong
in their heartbeats blazing wake until red cock
plucks bare that comets flowering
dawn snuffs out stars spent wick,
even as loves dear fools cry evergreen,
and a languor of wax congeals the vein
no matter how fiercely lit staunch contracts break
and recoil in the altering light the radiant limb
blows ash in each lovers eye the ardent look
blackens flesh to bone and devours them
fiesta melons
in benidorm there are melons,
whole donkeycarts full
of innumerable melons,
ovals and balls,
bright green and thumpable
laced over with stripes
of turtledark green
choose an eggshape, a worldshape,
bowl one homeward to taste
in the whitehot noon
creamsmooth honeydews,
pinkpulped whoppers,
bumprinded cantaloupes
with orange cores

each wedge wears a studding
of blanched seeds or black seeds
to strew like confetti
under the feet of
this market of meloneating
fiestagoers

the goring
arena dust rusted by four bulls blood to a dull redness,
the afternoon at a bad end under the crowds truculence,
the ritual death each time botched among dropped capes, illjudged
stabs,
the strongest will seemed a will toward ceremony obese, dark
faced in his rich yellows, tassels, pompons, braid, the picador
rode out against the fifth bull to brace his pike and slowly bear
down deep into the bent bullneck cumbrous routine, not artwork
instinct for art began with the bulls horn lofting in the mobs
hush a lumped manshape the whole act formal, fluent as a dance
blood faultlessly broached redeemed the sullied air, the earths grossness

the beggars
nightfall, cold eyeneither disheartens
these goatish tragedians who
hawk misfortune like figs and chickens
and, plaintiff against each day, decry
natures partial, haphazard thumb
under white wall and moorish window
griefs honest grimace, debased by time,
caricatures itself and thrives
on the coins of pity at random

a beggar stops among eggs and loaves,
props a legstump upon a crutch,
jiggles his tin cup at the good wives
by lack and loss these beggars encroach
on spirits tenderer than theirs,
sufferingtoughened beyond the fetch
of finest conscience
nightfall obscures
the bays sheer, extravagant blue,
white house and almond grove the beggars
outlast their evilest star, wryly
and with a perfidious verve
baffle the dark, the pitying eye
spider
anansi, black busybody of the folktales,
you scuttle out on impulse
blunt in selfinterest
as a sledge hammer, as a mans bunched fist,
yet of devils the cleverest
to get your carousals told
you spun the cosmic web you squint from center field
last summer i came upon your spanish cousin,
notable robber baron,
behind a goatherds hut
near his small stonehenge above the ants route,
onethird antsize, a leggy spot,
he tripped an ant with a rope
scarcely visible about and about the slope
of his redoubt he ran his nimble filament,
each time round winding that ant
tighter to the cocoon
already veiling the gray spool of stone
i
from which coils, caught ants waved legs in
torpid warning, or lay still
and suffered their livelier fellows to struggle
then briskly scaled his altar tiered with tethered ants,
nodding in a somnolence
appalling to witness,
to the barbarous outlook, from there chose
his next martyr to the gross cause
of concupiscence once more
with black alacrity bound round his prisoner
the antsa file of comers, a file of goers
persevered on a set course
no scruple could disrupt,
obeying orders of instinct till swept
offstage and infamously wrapped
up by a spry black deus
ex machina nor did they seem deterred by this
spinster
now this particular girl
during a ceremonious april walk
with her latest suitor
found herself, of a sudden, intolerably struck
by the birds irregular babel
and the leaves litter
by this tumult afflicted, she
observed her lovers gestures unbalance the air,
his gait stray uneven
through a rank wilderness of fern and flower
she judged petals in disarray,
the whole season, sloven
how she longed for winter then
scrupulously austere in its order
of white and black
ice and rock, each sentiment within border,
i
and hearts frosty discipline
exact as a snowflake
but herea burgeoning
unruly enough to pitch her five queenly wits
into vulgar motley
a treason not to be borne let idiots
reel giddy in bedlam spring
she withdrew neatly
and round her house she set
such a barricade of barb and check
against mutinous weather
as no mere insurgent man could hope to break
with curse, fist, threat
or love, either
rhyme
ive got a stubborn goose whose guts
honeycombed with golden eggs,
yet wont lay one
she, addled in her goosewit, struts
the barnyard like those taloned hags
who ogle men
and crimp their wrinkles in a grin,
jangling their great money bags
while i eat grits
she fattens on the finest grain
now, as i hone my knife, she begs
pardon, and thats
so humbly done, id turn this keen
steel on myself before profit
by such a rogues
act, buthow those feathers shine
exit from a smoking slit
her ruby dregs

departure
the figs on the fig tree in the yard are green
green, also, the grapes on the green vine
shading the brickred porch tiles
the moneys run out
how nature, sensing this, compounds her bitters
ungifted, ungrieved, our leavetaking
the sun shines on unripe corn
cats play in the stalks
retrospect shall not soften such penury
suns brass, the moons steely patinas,
the leaden slag of the world
but always expose
the scraggy rock spit shielding the towns blue bay
against which the brunt of outer sea
beats, is brutal endlessly
gullfouled, a stone hut
bares its low lintel to corroding weathers
across the jut of ochreous rock
goats shamble, morose, rankhaired,
to lick the seasalt
maudlin
mudmattressed under the sign of the hag
in a clench of blood, the sleeptalking virgin
gibbets with her curse the moons man,
faggotbearing jack in his crackless egg
hatched with a claret hogshead to swig
he kings it, navelknit to no groan,
but at the price of a pinstitched skin
fishtailed girls purchase each white leg

day of mist day of tarnish
with hands
unserviceable, i wait
for the milk van
the oneeared cat
laps its gray paw
and the coal fire burns
outside, the little hedge leaves are
become quite yellow
a milkfilm blurs
the empty bottles on the windowsill
no glory descends
two water drops poise
on the arched green
stem of my neighbors rose bush
o bent bow of thorns
the cat unsheathes its claws
the world turns

today i will not
disenchant my twelve blackgowned examiners
or bunch my fist

landowners
from my rented attic with no earth
to call my own except the airmotes,
i malign the leaden perspective
of identical gray brick houses,
orange rooftiles, orange chimney pots,
and see that first house, as if between
mirrors, engendering a spectral
corridor of inane replicas,
flimsily peopled
but landowners
own their cabbage roots, a space of stars,
indigenous peace such substance makes
my eyeful of reflections a ghosts
eyeful, which, envious, would define
death as striking root on one landtract

saying somethings addled in a woman who accommodates
that many cats
rum and redfaced as a watermelon, her voice
long gone to wheeze and seed, ella mason

with cream and chickengut feasting the palates
of finical cats
village stories go that in olden days
ella flounced about, minxthin and haughty,
a fashionable beauty,
slaying the dandies with her emerald eyes
now, run to fat, shes a spinster whose door shuts
on all but cats
once we children sneaked over to spy miss mason
napping in her kitchen paved with saucers
on antimacassars
tabletop, cupboard shelf, cats lounged brazen,
one grufftimbred purr rolling from furred throats
such stentorian cats
with poke and giggle, ready to skedaddle,
we peered agog through the cobwebbed door
straight into yellow glare
of guardian cats crouched round their idol,
while ella drowsed whiskered with sleek face, sly wits
sphinxqueen of cats
look there she goes, catlady mason
we snickered as she shambled down somerset terrace
to market for her dearies,
more mammoth and blowsy with every season
miss ellas got loony from keeping in cahoots
with eleven cats
but now turned kinder with time, we mark miss mason
blinking greeneyed and solitary
at girls who marry
demure ones, lithe ones, needing no lesson
that vain jades sulk single down bridal nights,
accurst as wildcats

crystal gazer
gerd sits spindleshanked in her dark tent,
lean face gone tawn with seasons,
skin worn down to the knucklebones
at her tough trade without times taint
the burnished ball hangs fire in her hands, a lens
fusing times three horizons
two enter to tap her sight, a green pair
fresh leaved out in vows come tell
how we shall do together,
well or ill gerd slants a look at each most dear,
each to the other fit fiber for stern weather
slowly she spins the ball
i see two stalwart apple trees
coupled by branches intertwined
and, springing all about,
staunch saplings to this house, thriving days
will bring crops increase, and harvest fruit
follow on kind wind
no hardship then ? he asks well take
whatever trials to come, so say true
his bride echoes his word at that,
gerd whirls the ball ablaze rough storm, she grants, may wreak
some havoc on tender limb, and yet
strengthen that orchard thereby
their small price paid, these wedded ones
walk forth into sunmoneyed air, quickened
to savor their span of flourishing
aloof, squatting mummywise, gerd scans
that clairvoyant quartz which once, at her own wishing,
exacted her first simple sight for this strict second
then, a freegadding hoyden, gerd had craved
to govern more sight than given to a woman
by wits alone to foresee her lovers faith
and their future lot, she braved
church curse to ken that crooked oath
whereby one hires a demon
a flash like doomcrack rent nights black
gods work stood anchored in that glare
focusing all times daysuns in one
so beggar gerd might aim her look
at gorgonprospects with power to strike to stone
hearts of those who pierced times core
i
what gerd saw then engraved her mind
plaguepitted as the moon each bud
shriveling to cinders at its source,
each love blazing blind to its gutted end
and, fixed in the crystal center, grinning fierce
earths evergreen deaths head

november graveyard
the scene stands stubborn skinflint trees
hoard last years leaves, wont mourn, wear sackcloth, or turn
to elegiac dryads, and dour grass
guards the hardhearted emerald of its grassiness
however the grandiloquent mind may scorn
such poverty no dead mens cries
flower forgetmenots between the stones
paving this grave ground heres honest rot
to unpick the heart, pare bone
free of the fictive vein when one stark skeleton
bulks real, all saints tongues fall quiet
flies watch no resurrections in the sun
at the essential landscape stare, stare
till your eyes foist a vision dazzling on the wind
whatever lost ghosts flare,
damned, howling in their shrouds across the moor
rave on the leash of the starving mind
which peoples the bare room, the blank, untenanted air

black rook in rainy w e a t h e r
on the stiff twig up there
hunches a wet black rook
arranging and rearranging its feathers in the rain
i do not expect a miracle
or an accident
i
to set the sight on fire
in my eye, nor seek
any more in the desultory weather some design,
but let spotted leaves fall as they fall,
without ceremony, or portent
although, i admit, i desire,
occasionally, some backtalk
from the mute sky, i cant honestly complain
a certain minor light may still
lean incandescent
out of kitchen table or chair
as if a celestial burning took
possession of the most obtuse objects now and then
thus hallowing an interval
otherwise inconsequent
by bestowing largesse, honor,
one might say love at any rate, i now walk
wary for it could happen
even in this dull, ruinous landscape skeptical,
yet politic ignorant
of whatever angel may choose to flare
suddenly at my elbow i only know that a rook
ordering its black feathers can so shine
as to seize my senses, haul
my eyelids up, and grant
a brief respite from fear
of total neutrality with luck,
trekking stubborn through this season
of fatigue, i shall
patch together a content
of sorts miracles occur,
if you care to call those spasmodic
tricks of radiance miracles the waits begun again,
the long wait for the angel,
for that rare, random descent

the snowman on the moor
stalemated their armies stood, with tottering banners
she flung from a room
still ringing with bruit of insults and dishonors
and in fury left him
glowering at the coalfire come find me her last taunt
he did not come
but sat on, guarding his grim battlement
by the doorstep
her winterbeheaded daisies, marrowless, gaunt,
warned her to keep
indoors with politic goodwill, not haste
into a landscape
of stark windharrowed hills and weltering mist
but from the house
she stalked intractable as a driven ghost
across moor snows
pocked by rookclaw and rabbittrack she must yet win
him to his knees
let him send police and hounds to bring her in
nursing her rage
through bare whistling heather, over stiles of black stone,

to the worlds white edge
she came, and called hell to subdue an unruly man
and join her siege
it was no fireblurting forktailed demon
volcanoed hot
from marble snowheap of moor to ride that woman
with spur and knout
down from prides size instead, a grislythewed,
austere, corpsewhite
giant heaved into the distance, stonehatcheted,
skyhigh, and snow
floured his whirling beard, and at his tread
ambushed birds by
dozens dropped dead in the hedges o she felt
no love in his eye,
worsesaw dangling from that spikestudded belt
ladies sheaved skulls
mournfully the dry tongues clacked their guilt
our wit made fools
of kings, unmanned kings sons our masteries
amused court halls
for that brag, we barnacle these iron thighs
throned in the thick
of a blizzard, the giant roared up with his chittering trophies
from brunt of axecrack
she shied sideways a white fizz and the giant, pursuing,
crumbled to smoke
humbled then, and crying,
the girl bent homeward, brimful of gentle talk
and mild obeying

mayflower
throughout black winter the red haws withstood
assault of snowflawed winds from the dour skies
and, bright as blooddrops, proved no brave branch dies
if roots firmfixed and resolution good
now, as green sap ascends the steepled wood,
each hedge with such white bloom astounds our eyes
as sprang from josephs rod, and testifies
how best beautys born of hardihood
so when staunch island stock chose forfeiture
of the homeland hearth to plough their pilgrim way
across atlantic furrows, dark, unsure
remembering the white, triumphant spray
on hawthorn boughs, with goodwill to endure
they named their ship after the flower of may
sow
god knows how our neighbor managed to breed
his great sow
whatever his shrewd secret, he kept it hid
in the same way
he kept the sowimpounded from public stare,
prize ribbon and pig show
but one dusk our questions commended us to a tour
through his lanternlit
maze of barns to the lintel of the sunk sty door
to gape at it
this was no roseandlarkspurred china suckling
with a penny slot
for thrifty children, nor dolt pig ripe for heckling,
about to be
glorified for prime flesh and golden crackling

in a parsley halo
nor even one of the common barnyard sows,
miresmirched, blowzy,
maunching thistle and knotweed on her snoutcruise
bloat tun of milk
on the move, hedged by a litter of featfoot ninnies
shrilling her hulk
to halt for a swig at the pink teats no this vast
brobdingnag bulk
of a sow lounged bellybedded on that black compost,
fatrutted eyes
dreamfilmed what a vision of ancient hoghood must
thus wholly engross
the great grandam our marvel blazoned a knight,
helmed, in cuirass,
unhorsed and shredded in the grove of combat
by a grislybristled
boar, fabulous enough to straddle that sows heat
but our farmer whistled,
then, with a jocular fist thwacked the barrel nape,
and the greencopsecastled
pig hove, letting legend like dried mud drop,
slowly, grunt
on grunt, up in the flickering light to shape
a monument
prodigious in gluttonies as that hog whose want
made lean lent
of kitchen slops and, stomaching no constraint,
proceeded to swill
the seven troughed seas and every earthquaking continent

the everlasting monday
thou shalt have an everlasting
monday and stand in the moon
the moons man stands in his shell,
bent under a bundle
of sticks the light falls chalk and cold
upon our bedspread
his teeth are chattering among the leprous
peaks and craters of those extinct volcanoes
he also against black frost
would pick sticks, would not rest
until his own lit room outshone
sundays ghost of sun
now works his hell of mondays in the moons
fireless, seven chill seas chained to his ankle
hardcastle crags
flintlike, her feet struck
such a racket of echoes from the steely street,
tacking in moonblued crooks from the black
stonebuilt town, that she heard the quick air ignite
its tinder and shake
a firework of echoes from wall
to wall of the dark, dwarfed cottages
but the echoes died at her back as the walls
gave way to fields and the incessant seethe of grasses
riding in the full
of the moon, manes to the wind,
tireless, tied, as a moonbound sea
moves on its root though a mistwraith wound
up from the fissured valley and hung shoulderhigh
ahead, it fattened

to no familyfeatured ghost,
nor did any word body with a name
the blank mood she walked in once past
the dreampeopled village, her eyes entertained no dream,
and the sandmans dust
lost lustre under her footsoles
the long wind, paring her person down
to a pinch of flame, blew its burdened whistle
in the whorl of her ear, and like a scoopedout pumpkin crown
her head cupped the babel
all the night gave her, in return
for the paltry gift of her bulk and the beat
of her heart, was the humped indifferent iron
of its hills, and its pastures bordered by black stone set
on black stone barns
guarded broods and litters
behind shut doors the dairy herds
knelt in the meadow mute as boulders
sheep drowsed stoneward in their tussocks of wool, and birds,
twigsleeping, wore
granite ruffs, their shadows
the guise of leaves the whole landscape
loomed absolute as the antique world was
once, in its earliest sway of lymph and sap,
unaltered by eyes,
enough to snuff the quick
of her small heat out, but before the weight
of stones and hills of stones could break
her down to mere quartz grit in that stony light
she turned back

the thin people
they are always with us, the thin people
meager of dimension as the gray people
on a moviescreen they
are unreal, we say
it was only in a movie, it was only
in a war making evil headlines when we
were small that they famished and
grew so lean and would not round
out their stalky limbs again though peace
plumped the bellies of the mice
under the meanest table
it was during the long hungerbattle
they found their talent to persevere
in thinness, to come, later,
into our bad dreams, their menace
not guns, not abuses,
but a thin silence
wrapped in flearidden donkey skins,
empty of complaint, forever
drinking vinegar from tin cups they wore
the insufferable nimbus of the lotdrawn
scapegoat but so thin,
so weedy a race could not remain in dreams,
could not remain outlandish victims
in the contracted country of the head
any more than the old woman in her mud hut could

keep from cutting fat meat
out of the side of the generous moon when it
set foot nightly in her yard
until her knife had pared
the moon to a rind of little light
now the thin people do not obliterate
themselves as the dawn
grayness blues, reddens, and the outline
of the world comes clear and fills with color
they persist in the sunlit room the wallpaper
frieze of cabbageroses and cornflowers pales
under their thinlipped smiles,
their withering kingship
how they prop each other up
we own no wildernesses rich and deep enough
for stronghold against their stiff
battalions see, how the tree boles flatten
and lose their good browns
if the thin people simply stand in the forest,
making the world go thin as a wasps nest
and grayer not even moving their bones

on the difficulty of conjuring up
a dryad
ravening through the persistent bricabrac
of blunt pencils, rosesprigged coffee cup,
postage stamps, stacked books clamor and yawp,

neighborhood cockcrowall natures prodigal backtalk,
the vaunting mind
snubs impromptu spiels of wind
and wrestles to impose
its own order on what is
with my fantasy alone, brags the importunate head,
arrogant among rooktongued spaces,
sheep greens, finned falls, i shall compose a crisis
to stun sky black out, drive gibbering mad
trout, cock, ram,
that bulk so calm
on my jealous stare,
selfsufficient as they are
but no hocuspocus of green angels
damasks with dazzle the threadbare eye
my trouble, doctor, is i see a tree,
and that damn scrupulous tree wont practice wiles
to beguile sight
eg, by cant of light
concoct a daphne
my tree stays tree
however i wrench obstinate bark and trunk
to my sweet will, no luminous shape
steps out radiant in limb, eye, lip,
to hoodwink the honest earth which pointblank
spurns such fiction
as nymphs cold vision
will have no counterfeit
palmed off on it
no doubt now in dreampropertied fall some mooneyed,
starlucky sleightofhand man watches
my jilting lady squander coin, gold leaf stock ditches,
and the opulent air go studded with seed,
while this beggared brain
hatches no fortune,
but from leaf, from grass,
thieves what it has

on the plethora of dryads
hearing a white saint rave
about a quintessential beauty
visible only to the paragon heart,
i tried my sight on an appletree
that for eccentric knob and wart
had all my love
without meat or drink i sat
starving my fantasy down
to discover that metaphysical tree which hid
from my worldling look its brilliant vein
far deeper in gross wood
than axe could cut
but before i might blind sense
to see with the spotless soul,
each particular quirk so ravished me
every pock and stain bulked more beautiful
than flesh of any body
flawed by loves prints
battle however i would
to break through that patchwork
of leaves bicker and whisk in babel tongues,
streak and mottle of tawn bark,
no visionary lightnings
pierced my dense lid
instead, a wanton fit
dragged each dazzled sense apart
surfeiting eye, ear, taste, touch, smell
now, snared by this miraculous art,
i ride earths burning carrousel
day in, day out,
and such grit corrupts my eyes
i must watch sluttish dryads twitch

their multifarious silks in the holy grove
until no chaste tree but suffers blotch
under flux of those seductive
reds, greens, blues
the other two
all summer we moved in a villa brimful of echoes,
cool as the pearled interior of a conch
bells, hooves, of the highstepping black goats woke us
around our bed the baronial furniture
foundered through levels of light seagreen and strange
not one leaf wrinkled in the clearing air
we dreamed how we were perfect, and we were
against bare, whitewashed walls, the furniture
anchored itself, griffinlegged and darkly grained
two of us in a place meant for ten more
our footsteps multiplied in the shadowy chambers,
our voices fathomed a profounder sound
the walnut banquet table, the twelve chairs
mirrored the intricate gestures of two others
heavy as statuary, shapes not ours
performed a dumbshow in the polished wood,
that cabinet without windows or doors
he lifts an arm to bring her close, but she
shies from his touch his is an iron mood
seeing her freeze, he turns his face away
they poise and grieve as in some old tragedy
moonblanched and implacable, he and she
would not be eased, released our each example
of tenderness dove through their purgatory
like a planet, a stone, swallowed in a great darkness,
leaving no sparky track, setting up no ripple
nightly we left them in their desert place
lights out, they dogged us, sleepless and envious

we dreamed their arguments, their stricken voices
we might embrace, but those two never did,
come, so unlike us, to a stiff impasse,
burdened in such a way we seemed the lighter
ourselves the haunters, and they, flesh and blood
as if, above loves ruinage, we were
the heaven those two dreamed of, in despair
the lady and the earthenware head
fired in sanguine clay, the model head
fit nowhere brickdustcomplected, eye under a dense lid,
on the long bookshelf it stood
stolidly propping thick volumes of prose spiteset
ape of her look best rid
hearthstone at once of the outrageous head
still, she felt loath to junk it
no place, it seemed, for the effigy to fare
free from all molesting rough boys,
spying a pate to spare
glowering sullen and pompous from an ashheap,
might well seize this prize,
maltreat the hostage head in shocking wise,
and waken the sly nerve up
that knits to each original its coarse copy a dark tarn
she thought of then, thicksilted, with weeds obscured,
to serve her exacting turn
but out of the watery aspic, laureled by fins,
the simulacrum leered,
lewdly beckoning, and her courage wavered
she blenched, as one who drowns,
and resolved more ceremoniously to lodge
the mimic headin a crotched willow, green
vaulted by foliage
let belltongued birds descant in blackest feather
on the rendering, grain by grain,

of that uncouth shape to simple sod again
through drear and dulcet weather
yet, shrined on her shelf, the grisly visage endured,
despite her wrung hands, her tears, her praying vanish
steadfast and evilstarred,
it ogled through rockfault, windflaw and fisted wave
an antique haghead, too tough for knife to finish,
refusing to diminish
by one jot its basilisklook of love

all the dead dears
in the archaeological museum in cambridge is a stone
coffin of the fourth century ad containing the skeletons
of a woman, a mouse and a shrew the anklebone of the
woman has been slightly gnawn
rigged pokerstiff on her back
with a granite grin
this antique museumcased lady
lies, companioned by the gimcrack
relics of a mouse and a shrew
that battened for a day on her anklebone
these three, unmasked now, bear
dry witness
to the gross eating game
wed wink at if we didnt hear
stars grinding, crumb by crumb,
our own grist down to its bony face
how they grip us through thin and thick,
these barnacle dead
this lady heres no kin
of mine, yet kin she is shell suck
blood and whistle my marrow clean
to prove it as i think now of her head,
from the mercurybacked glass
mother, grandmother, greatgrandmother
reach hag hands to haul me in,

and an image looms under the fishpond surface
where the daft father went down
with orange duckfeet winnowing his hair
all the long gone darlings they
get back, though, soon,
soon be it by wakes, weddings,
childbirths or a family barbecue
any touch, taste, tangs
fit for those outlaws to ride home on,
and to sanctuary usurping the armchair
between tick
and tack of the clock, until we go,
each skulledandcrossboned gulliver
riddled with ghosts, to lie
deadlocked with them, taking root as cradles rock
natural history
that lofty monarch, monarch mind,
blueblooded in coarse country reigned
though he bedded in ermine, gorged on roast,
pure philosophy his love engrossed
while subjects hungered, emptypursed,
with stars, with angels, he conversed
till, sick of their rulers godling airs,
in one body those earthborn commoners
rose up and put royal nerves to the rack
king egghead saw his domain crack,
his crown usurped by the low brow
of the base, barbarous prince ow
two views of withens
above whorled, spindling gorse,
sheepfootflattened grasses,
stone wall and ridgepole rise
i
prowlike through blurs
of fog in that hinterland few
hikers get to
home of uncatchable
sage hen and spry rabbit,
where second wind, hip boot
help over hill
and hill, and through peaty water
i found bare moor,
a colorless weather,
and the house of eros
lowlintelled, no palace
you, luckier,
report white pillars, a blue sky,
the ghosts, kindly
the great carbuncle
we came over the moortop
through air streaming and greenlit,
stone farms foundering in it,
valleys of grass altering
in a light neither of dawn
nor nightfall, our hands, faces
lucent as porcelain, the earths
claim and weight gone out of them
some such transfiguring moved
the eight pilgrims towards its source
toward that great jewel shown often,
never given hidden, yet
simultaneously seen
on moortop, at seabottom,
knowable only by light
other than noon, than moon, stars
the onceknown way becoming

wholly other, and ourselves
estranged, changed, suspended where
angels are rumored, clearly
floating, among the floating
tables and chairs gravitys
lost in the lift and drift of
an easier element
than earth, and there is nothing
so fine we cannot do it
but nearing means distancing
at the common homecoming
light withdraws chairs, tables drop
down the body weighs like stone
words for a nursery
rosebud, knot of worms,
heir of the first five
shapers, i open
five moony crescents
for eyes to light me
toward what i can grab,
milkspout, big finger
so many ladders
giving a leg up
to these limber hooks
i learn, good circus
dog that i am, how
to move, serve, steer food,
index the arrow,
thumbhead, blunt helper,
my masters fetcher,
whipper of itches,
no pocket dozer,
i shut on the key
of this bluegreen toy

fiveantlered, branching
touchy antenna,
i nose out the lay
of thistle and silk,
cold pole and hot plate
old historian,
my page this desert
crossed by three causeways,
leathery, treeless,
with five whorled landspits
brownbacked, whitebellied
as a flatfish, i
swim the sea of do,
the left my lackey,
my backward image
penbearer, scrubnurse,
the captains batman,
by heart here i hold
coin, button, trigger
and his loves body
illserved hell be when
age manhandles me
a crab to nap on
chairarms and tables,
five wickless candles
to wag at the dark
and worseserved when death
makes off with this rose,
five worms in a box
to feed the thin crows

t h e disquieting muses
mother, mother, what illbred aunt
or what disfigured and unsightly
cousin did you so unwisely keep
unasked to my christening, that she
sent these ladies in her stead

with heads like darningeggs to nod
and nod and nod at foot and head
and at the left side of my crib ?
mother, who made to order stories
of mixie blackshort the heroic bear,
mother, whose witches always, always
got baked into gingerbread, i wonder
whether you saw them, whether you said
words to rid me of those three ladies
nodding by night around my bed,
mouthless, eyeless, with stitched bald head
in the hurricane, when fathers twelve
study windows bellied in
like bubbles about to break, you fed
my brother and me cookies and ovaltine
and helped the two of us to choir
thor is angry boom boom boom
thor is angry we dont care
but those ladies broke the panes
when on tiptoe the schoolgirls danced,
blinking flashlights like fireflies
and singing the glowworm song, i could
not lift a foot in the twinkledress
but, heavyfooted, stood aside
in the shadow cast by my dismalheaded
godmothers, and you cried and cried
and the shadow stretched, the lights went out
mother, you sent me to piano lessons
and praised my arabesques and trills
although each teacher found my touch
oddly wooden in spite of scales
and the hours of practicing, my ear
tonedeaf and yes, unteachable
i learned, i learned, i learned elsewhere,
from muses unhired by you, dear mother
i woke one day to see you, mother,
floating above me in bluest air

on a green balloon bright with a million
flowers and bluebirds that never were
never, never, found anywhere
but the little planet bobbed away
like a soapbubble as you called come here
and i faced my traveling companions
day now, night now, at head, side, feet,
they stand their vigil in gowns of stone,
faces blank as the day i was born,
their shadows long in the setting sun
that never brightens or goes down
and this is the kingdom you bore me to,
mother, mother but no frown of mine
will betray the company i keep

night shift
it was not a heart, beating,
that muted boom, that clangor
far off, not blood in the ears
drumming up any fever
to impose on the evening
the noise came from outside
a metal detonating
native, evidently, to
these stilled suburbs nobody
startled at it, though the sound
shook the ground with its pounding
it took root at my coming
till the thudding source, exposed,
confounded inept guesswork
framed in windows of main streets
silver factory, immense
hammers hoisted, wheels turning,
stalled, let fall their vertical

tonnage of metal and wood
stunned the marrow men in white
undershirts circled, tending
without stop those greased machines,
tending, without stop, the blunt
indefatigable fact

ouija
it is a chilly god, a god of shades,
rises to the glass from his black fathoms
at the window, those unborn, those undone
assemble with the frail paleness of moths,
an envious phosphorescence in their wings
vermilions, bronzes, colors of the sun
in the coal fire will not wholly console them
imagine their deep hunger, deep as the dark
for the bloodheat that would ruddle or reclaim
the glass mouth sucks bloodheat from my forefinger
the old god dribbles, in return, his words
the old god, too, writes aureate poetry
in tarnished modes, maundering among the wastes,
fair chronicler of every foul declension
age, and ages of prose, have uncoiled
his talking whirlwind, abated his excessive temper
when words, like locusts, drummed the darkening air
and left the cobs to rattle, bitten clean
skies once wearing a blue, divine hauteur
ravel above us, mistily descend,
thickening with motes, to a marriage with the mire
he hymns the rotten queen with saffron hair
who has saltier aphrodisiacs
than virgins tears that bawdy queen of death,
her wormy couriers are at his bones
still he hymns juice of her, hot nectarine
i see him, hornyskinned and tough, construe
what flinty pebbles the ploughblade upturns
as ponderable tokens of her love
j
he, godly, doddering, spells
no succinct gabriel from the letters here
but floridly, his amorous nostalgias

on the decline of oracles
my father kept a vaulted conch
by two bronze bookends of ships in sail,
and as i listened its cold teeth seethed
with voices of that ambiguous sea
old bocklin missed, who held a shell
to hear the sea he could not hear
what the seashell spoke to his inner ear
he knew, but no peasants know
my father died, and when he died
he willed his books and shell away
the books burned up, sea took the shell,
but i, i keep the voices he
set in my ear, and in my eye
the sight of those blue, unseen waves
for which the ghost of bocklin grieves
the peasants feast and multiply
eclipsing the spitted ox i see
neither brazen swan nor burning star,
heraldry of a starker age,
but three men entering the yard,
and those men coming up the stair
profitless, their gossiping images
invade the cloistral eye like pages
from a gross comic strip, and toward
the happening of this happening
the earth turns now in half an hour
i shall go down the shabby stair and meet,
coming up, those three worth
less than present, pastthis future
worthless such vision to eyes gone dull
that once descried troys towers fall,
saw evil break out of the north


snakecharmer
as the gods began one world, and man another,
so the snakecharmer begins a snaky sphere
with mooneye, mouthpipe he pipes pipes green pipes water
pipes water green until green waters waver
with reedy lengths and necks and undulatings
and as his notes twine green, the green river
shapes its images around his songs
he pipes a place to stand on, but no rocks,
no floor a wave of flickering grass tongues
supports his foot he pipes a world of snakes,
of sways and coilings, from the snakerooted bottom
of his mind and now nothing but snakes
is visible the snakescales have become
leaf, become eyelid snakebodies, bough, breast
of tree and human and he within this snakedom
rules the writhings which make manifest
his snakehood and his might with pliant tunes
from his thin pipe out of this green nest
as out of edens navel twist the lines
of snaky generations let there be snakes
and snakes there were, are, will betill yawns
consume this piper and he tires of music
and pipes the world back to the simple fabric
of snakewarp, snakeweft pipes the cloth of snakes
to a melting of green waters, till no snake
shows its head, and those green waters back to
water, to green, to nothing like a snake
puts up his pipe, and lids his moony eye


a lesson in vengeance
in the dour ages
of drafty cells and draftier castles,
of dragons breathing without the frame of fables,
saint and king unfisted obstructions knuckles
by no miracle or majestic means,
but by such abuses
as smack of spite and the overscrupulous
twisting of thumbscrews one soul tied in sinews,
one white horse drowned, and all the unconquered pinnacles
of gods city and babylons
must wait, while here susos
hand hones his tacks and needles,
scourging to sores his own red sluices
for the relish of heaven, relentless, dousing with prickles
of horsehair and lice his horny loins
while there irate cyrus
squanders a summer and the brawn of his heroes
to rebuke the horseswallowing river gyndes
he split it into three hundred and sixty trickles
a girl could wade without wetting her shins
still, latterday sages,
smiling at this behavior, subjugating their enemies
neatly, nicely, by disbelief or bridges,
never grip, as their grandsires did, that devil who chuckles
from grain of the marrow and the riverbed grains


virgin in a tree
how this tart fable instructs
and mocks heres the parody of that moral mousetrap
set in the proverbs stitched on samplers
approving chased girls who get them to a tree
and put on barks nunblack
habit which deflects
all amorous arrows for to sheathe the virgin shape
in a scabbard of wood baffles pursuers,
whether goatthighed or godhaloed ever since that first daphne
switched her incomparable back
for a baytree hide, respects
twined to her hard limbs like ivy the puritan lip
cries celebrate syrinx whose demurs
won her the frogcolored skin, pale pith and watery
bed of a reed look
pineneedle armor protects
pitys from pans assault and though age drop
their leafy crowns, their fame soars,
eclipsing eva, cleo and helen of troy
for which of those would speak
for a fashion that constricts
white bodies in a wooden girdle, root to top
unfaced, unformed, the nippleflowers
shrouded to suckle darkness ? only they
who keep cool and holy make

a sanctum to attract
green virgins, consecrating limb and lip
to chastitys service like prophets, like preachers,
they descant on the serene and seraphic beauty
of virgins for virginitys sake
be certain some such pacts
been struck to keep all glory in the grip
of ugly spinsters and barren sirs
as you etch on the inner window of your eye
this virgin on her rack
she, ripe and unplucked, s
lain splayed too long in the tortuous boughs overripe
now, dourfaced, her fingers
stiff as twigs, her body woodenly
askew, shell ache and wake
though doomsday bud neglects
given her lips that lemontasting droop
untongued, all beautys bright juice sours
treetwist will ape this gross anatomy
till ironys bough break

perseus
t h e t r i u m p h of wit over suffering
head alone shows you in the prodigious act
of digesting what centuries alone digest
the mammoth, lumbering statuary of sorrow,
indissoluble enough to riddle the guts
of a whale with holes and holes, and bleed him white
into salt seas hercules had a simple time,
rinsing those stables a babys tears would do it
but whod volunteer to gulp the laocoon,
the dying gaul and those innumerable pietas
festering on the dim walls of europes chapels,
museums and sepulchers? you

you
who borrowed feathers for your feet, not lead,
not nails, and a mirror to keep the snaky head
in safe perspective, could outface the gorgongrimace
of human agony a look to numb
limbs not a basiliskblink, nor a double whammy,
but all the accumulated last grunts, groans,
cries and heroic couplets concluding the million
enacted tragedies on these bloodsoaked boards,
and every private twinge a hissing asp
to petrify your eyes, and every village
catastrophe a writhing length of cobra,
and the decline of empires the thick coil of a vast
anaconda
imagine the world
fisted to a foetus head, ravined, seamed
with suffering from conception upwards, and there
you have it in hand grit in the eye or a sore
thumb can make anyone wince, but the whole globe
expressive of grief turns gods, like kings, to rocks
those rocks, cleft and worn, themselves then grow
ponderous and extend despair on earths
dark face
so might rigor mortis come to stiffen
all creation, were it not for a bigger belly
still than swallows joy
you enter now,
armed with feathers to tickle as well as fly,
and a funhouse mirror that turns the tragic muse
to the beheaded head of a sullen doll, one braid,
a bedraggled snake, hanging limp as the absurd mouth
hangs in its lugubrious pout where are
the classic limbs of stubborn antigone ?
the red, royal robes of phedre? the teardazzled
sorrows of malfis gentle duchess ?
gone
in the deep convulsion gripping your face, muscles
and sinews bunched, victorious, as the cosmic
laugh does away with the unstitching, plaguey wounds
of an eternal sufferer

to you
perseus, the palm, and may you poise
and repoise until time stop, the celestial balance
which weighs our madness with our sanity

yadwigha, on a red couch,
a m o n g lilies
a sestina for the douanier
yadwigha, the literalists once wondered how you
came to be lying on this baroque couch
upholstered in red velvet, under the eye
of uncaged tigers and a tropical moon,
set in an intricate wilderness of green
heartshaped leaves, like catalpa leaves, and lilies
of monstrous size, like no wellbred lilies
it seems the consistent critics wanted you
to choose between your world of jungle green
and the fashionable monde of the red couch
with its prim bricabrac, without a moon
to turn you luminous, without the eye
of tigers to be stilled by your dark eye
and body whiter than its frill of lilies
theyd have had yellow silk screening the moon,
leaves and lilies flattened to paper behind you
or, at most, to a millefleurs tapestry but the couch
stood stubborn in its jungle red against green,
red against fifty variants of green,
the couch glared out at the prosaic eye

so rousseau, to explain why the red couch
persisted in the picture with the lilies,
tigers, snakes, and the snakecharmer and you,
and birds of paradise, and the round moon,
described how you fell dreaming at full of moon
on a red velvet couch within your green
tessellated boudoir hearing flutes, you
dreamed yourself away in the moons eye
to a beryl jungle, and dreamed that bright moonlilies
nodded their petaled heads around your couch
and that, rousseau told the critics, was why the couch
accompanied you so they nodded at the couch with the moon
and the snakecharmers song and the gigantic lilies,
marvelingly numbered the many shades of green
but to a friend, in private, rousseau confessed his eye
so possessed by the glowing red of the couch which you,
yadwigha, pose on, that he put you on the couch
to feed his eye with red such red under the moon,
in the midst of all that green and those great lilies

from south station to north

above the oxbow
here in this valley of discreet academies
we have not mountains, but mounts, truncated hillocks
t o the adirondacks, to northern monadnock,
themselves mere rocky hillocks to an everest

still, theyre our best mustering of height by
comparison with the sunken silvergrizzled
back of the connecticut, the riverlevel
flats of hadley farms, theyre lofty enough
elevations to be called something more than hills
green, wholly green, they stand their knobby spine
against our sky they are what we look southward to
up pleasant street at main poising their shapes
between the snuff and red tarpaper apartments,
they mound a summer coolness in our view
to people who live in the bottom of valleys
a rise in the landscape, hummock or hogback, looks
to be meant for climbing a peculiar logic
in going up for the coming down if the post
we start ats the same post we finish by,
but its the clear conversion at the top can hold
us to the oblique road, in spite of a fitful
wish for even ground, and its the last cliff
ledge will dislodge our cramped concept of space, unwall
horizons beyond vision, spill vision
after the horizons, stretching the narrowed eye
to full capacity we climb in hopes
of such seeing up the leafshuttered escarpments,
blindered by green, under a greengrained sky
into the blue tops define themselves as places
where nothing highers to be looked to downward looks

fourway veranda, viewkeeping above
the fallen timbers of its once remarkable
funicular railway, witness to gone

straightforwardly across the springing green

lived under the shadow of hot rooftops
and never saw how coolly we might move for once
a high hush quietens the crickets cry
memoirs of a spinachpicker
they called the place lookout farm
back then, the sun
didnt go down in such a hurry how it
lit things, that lamp of the possible
wet yet
lay over the leaves like a clear cellophane,
a pane of dragonfly wing, when they left me
with a hundred bushel baskets on the edge
of the spinach patch
bunch after bunch of green
upstanding spinachtips wedged in a circle
layer on layer, and you had a basket
irreproachable as any lettuce head,
pure leafage a hundred baskets by days end
sun and sky mirrored the green of the spinach
in the tin pail shaded by yellow paper
wellwater kept cool at the start of the rows
the water had an iron taste, and the air,
even, a tang of metal
day in, day out,
i bent over the plants in my leatherkneed

dungarees, proud as a lady in a sea
of prize roses, culling the fullest florets
my world pyramided with laden baskets
id only to set one foot in wilderness

the ghosts leavetaking
enter the chilly nomans land of about
five oclock in the morning, the nocolor void
where the waking head rubbishes out the draggled lot
of sulfurous dreamscapes and obscure lunar conundrums
which seemed, when dreamed, to mean so profoundly much,
gets ready to face the readymade creation
of chairs and bureaus and sleeptwisted sheets
this is the kingdom of the fading apparition,
the oracular ghost who dwindles on pinlegs
to a knot of laundry, with a classic bunch of sheets
upraised, as a hand, emblematic of farewell
at this joint between two worlds and two entirely
incompatible modes of time, the raw material
of our meatandpotato thoughts assumes the nimbus
of ambrosial revelation and so departs
chair and bureau are the hieroglyphs
of some godly utterance wakened heads ignore
so these posed sheets, before they thin to nothing,
speak in sign language of a lost otherworld,
a world we lose by merely waking up
trailing its telltale tatters only at the outermost
fringe of mundane vision, this ghost goes
hand aloft, goodbye, goodbye, not down
into the rocky gizzard of the earth,
but toward a region where our thick atmosphere

diminishes, and god knows what is there
a point of exclamation marks that sky
in ringing orange like a stellar carrot
its round period, displaced and green,
suspends beside it the first point, the starting
point of eden, next the new moons curve
go, ghost of our mother and father, ghost of us,
and ghost of our dreams children, in those sheets
which signify our origin and end,
to the cloudcuckoo land of color wheels
and pristine alphabets and cows that moo
and moo as they jump over moons as new
as that crisp cusp towards which you voyage now
hail and farewell hello, goodbye o keeper
of the profane grail, the dreaming skull

full fathom five
old man, you surface seldom
then you come in with the tides coming
when seas wash cold, foam
capped  white hair, white beard, farflung,
a dragnet, rising, falling, as waves
crest and trough miles long
extend the radial sheaves
of your spread hair, in which wrinkling skeins
knotted, caught, survives
the old myth of origins
unimaginable you float near
as keeled icemountains
of the north, to be steered clear
of, not fathomed all obscurity
starts with a danger
your dangers are many i
cannot look much but your form suffers
some strange injury

and seems to die so vapors
ravel to clearness on the dawn sea
the muddy rumors
of your burial move me
to halfbelieve your reappearance
proves rumors shallow,
for the archaic trenched lines
of your grained face shed time in runnels
ages beat like rains
on the unbeaten channels
of the ocean such sage humor and
durance are whirlpools
to make away with the ground
work of the earth and the skys ridgepole
waist down, you may wind
one labyrinthine tangle
to root deep among knuckles, shinbones,
skulls inscrutable,
below shoulders not once
seen by any man who kept his head,
you defy questions
you defy other godhood
i walk dry on your kingdoms border
exiled to no good
your shelled bed i remember
father, this thick air is murderous
i would breathe water


lorelei
it is no night to drown in
a full moon, river lapsing
black beneath bland mirrorsheen,
the blue watermists dropping
scrim after scrim like fishnets
though fishermen are sleeping,
the massive castle turrets
doubling themselves in a glass
all stillness yet these shapes float
up toward me, troubling the face
of quiet from the nadir
they rise, their limbs ponderous
with richness, hair heavier
than sculpted marble they sing
of a world more full and clear
than can be sisters, your song
bears a burden too weighty
for the whorled ears listening
here, in a wellsteered country,
under a balanced ruler
deranging by harmony
beyond the mundane order,
your voices lay siege you lodge
on the pitched reefs of nightmare,
promising sure harborage
by day, descant from borders
of hebetude, from the ledge
also of high windows worse
even than your maddening
song, your silence at the source

of your icehearted calling
drunkenness of the great depths
o river, i see drifting
deep in your flux of silver
those great goddesses of peace
stone, stone, ferry me down there
mussel hunter at rock harbor
i came before the water
colorists came to get the
good of the cape light that scours
sand grit to sided crystal
and buffs and sleeks the blunt hulls
of the three fishing smacks beached
on the bank of the rivers
backtracking tail id come for
free fishbait the blue mussels
clumped like bulbs at the grassroot
margin of the tidal pools
dawn tide stood dead low i smelt
mud stench, shell guts, gulls leavings
heard a queer crusty scrabble
cease, and i neared the silenced
edge of a cratered poolbed
the mussels hung dull blue and
conspicuous, yet it seemed
a sly worlds hinges had swung
shut against me all held still
though i counted scant seconds,
enough ages lapsed to win
confidence of safeconduct

in the wary otherworld
eyeing me grass put forth claws
small mud knobs, nudged from under,
displaced their domes as tiny
knights might doff their casques the crabs
inched from their pigmy burrows
and from the trenchdug mud, all
camouflaged in mottled mail
of browns and greens each wore one
claw swollen to a shield large
as itselfno fiddlers arm
grown gargantuan by trade,
but grown grimly, and grimly
borne, for a use beyond my
guessing of it sibilant
massmotived hordes, they sidled
out in a converging stream
toward the poolmouth, perhaps to
meet the thin and sluggish thread
of sea retracing its tide
way up the riverbasin
or to avoid me they moved
obliquely with a drywet
sound, with a glittery wisp
and trickle could they feel mud
pleasurable under claws
as i could between bare toes ?
that question ended iti
stood shut out, for once, for all,
puzzling the passage of their
absolutely alien
order as i might puzzle
at the clear tail of halleys
comet coolly giving my
orbit the goby, made known
by a family name it

knew nothing of so the crabs
went about their business, which
wasnt fiddling, and i filled
a big handkerchief with blue
mussels from what the crabs saw,
if they could see, i was one
twolegged musselpicker
high on the airy thatching
of the dense grasses i found
the husk of a fiddlercrab,
intact, strangely strayed above
his world of mudgreen color
and innards bleached and blown off
somewhere by much sun and wind
there was no telling if hed
died recluse or suicide
or headstrong columbus crab
the crabface, etched and set there,
grimaced as skulls grimace it
had an oriental look,
a samurai death mask done
on a tiger tooth, less for
arts sake than gods far from sea
where redfreckled crabbacks, claws
and whole crabs, dead, their soggy
bellies pallid and upturned,
perform their shambling waltzes
on the waves dissolving turn
and return, losing themselves
bit by bit to their friendly
elementthis relic saved
face, to face the baldfaced sun

moonrise
grubwhite mulberries redden among leaves
ill go out and sit in white like they do,
doing nothing julys juice rounds their nubs
this park is fleshed with idiot petals
white catalpa flowers tower, topple,
cast a round white shadow in their dying
a pigeon rudders down its fantails white
vocation enough opening, shutting
white petals, white fantails, ten white fingers
enough for fingernails to make halfmoons
redden in white palms no labor reddens
white bruises toward color, else collapses
berries redden a body of whiteness
rots, and smells of rot under its headstone
though the body walk out in clean linen
i smell that whiteness here, beneath the stones
where small ants roll their eggs, where grubs fatten
death may whiten in sun or out of it
death whitens in the egg and out of it
i can see no color for this whiteness
white it is a complexion of the mind
i tire, imagining white niagaras
build up from a rock root, as fountains build
against the weighty image of their fall
lucina, bony mother, laboring
among the socketed white stars, your face
of candor pares white flesh to the white bone,
who drag our ancient father at the heel,
whitebearded, weary the berries purple
and bleed the white stomach may ripen yet

frog autumn
summer grows old, coldblooded mother
the insects are scant, skinny
in these palustral homes we only
croak and wither
mornings dissipate in somnolence
the sun brightens tardily
among the pithless reeds flies fail us
the fen sickens
frost drops even the spider clearly
the genius of plenitude
houses himself elsewhere our folk thin
lamentably
in midas country
meadows of gold dust the silver
currents of the connecticut fan
and meander in bland pleatings under
riververge farms where ryeheads whiten
alls polished to a dull luster
in the sulfurous noon we move
with the languor of idols below
the skys great bell glass and briefly engrave
our limbs image on a field of straw
and goldenrod as on gold leaf
it might be heaven, this static
plenitude apples gold on the bough,
goldfinch, goldfish, golden tiger cat stock
still in one gigantic tapestry
and lovers affable, dovelike
but now the waterskiers race,
bracing their knees on unseen towlines

they cleave the rivers greening patinas
the mirror quivers to smithereens
they stunt like clowns in the circus
so we are hauled, though we would stop
on this amber bank where grasses bleach
already the farmers after his crop,
august gives over its midas touch,
wind bares a flintier landscape
incommunicado
the groundhog on the mountain did not run
but fatly scuttled into the splayed fern
and faced me, back to a ledge of dirt, to rattle
her sallow rodent teeth like castanets
against my leaning down, would not exchange
for that wary clatter sound or gesture
of love claws braced, at bay, my currency not hers
such meetings never occur in marchen
where lovemet groundhogs love one in return,
where straight talk is the rule, whether warm or hostile,
which no gruff animal misinterprets
from what grace am i fallen tongues are strange,
signs say nothing the falcon who spoke clear
to canacee cries gibberish to coarsened ears
childs park stones
in sunless air, under pines
green to the point of blackness, some
founding father set these lobed, warped stones
to loom in the leaffiltered gloom
black as the charred knucklebones

of a giant or extinct
animal, come from another
age, another planet surely flanked
by the orange and fuchsia bonfire
of azaleas, sacrosanct
these stones guard a dark repose
and keep their shapes intact while sun
alters shadows of rose and iris
long, short, longin the lit garden
and kindles a daysend blaze
colored to dull the pigment
of the azaleas, yet burnt out
quick as they to follow the lights tint
and intensity by midnight
by noon and throughout the brunt
of various weathers is
to know the still heart of the stcnes
stones that take the whole summer to lose
their dream of the winters cold stones
warming at core only as
frost forms no mans crowbar could
uproot them their beards are ever
green nor do they, once in a hundred
years, go down to drink the river
no thirst disturbs a stones bed

from deepsunk basements
what moved the pale, raptorial owl
then, to squall above the level
of streetlights and wires, its wall to wall

whiteness i remember
whiteness being what i remember
about sam whiteness and the great run
he gave me ive gone nowhere since but
goings been tame deviation white,
not of heraldic stallions offwhite
of the stable horse whose historys
humdrum, unexceptionable, his
tried sobriety hiring him out
to novices and to the timid
yet the dapple toning his white down
to safe gray never grayed his temper
i see him onetracked, stubborn, white horse,
first horse under me, high as the roofs,
his neat trot pitching my tense poise up,
unsettling the steadyrooted green
of country hedgerows and cow pastures
to a giddy jog then for ill will
or to try me he suddenly set
green grass streaming, houses a river
of pale fronts, straw thatchings, the hard road
an anvil, hooves four hammers to jolt
me off into their space of beating,

stirrups undone, and decorum and
wouldnt slow for the hauled reins, his name,
or shouts of walkers crossroad traffic
stalling curbside at his oncoming,
the world subdued to his run of it
i hung on his neck resoluteness
simplified me a rider, riding
hung out over hazard, over hooves
loud on earths bedrock almost thrown, not
thrown fear, wisdom, at one all colors
spinning to still in his one whiteness

fable of the rhododendron stealers
i walked the unwalked garden of rosebeds
in the public park at home felt the want
of a single rose present to imagine
the gardens remainder in full paint
the stone lionhead set in the wall
let drop its spittle of sluggish green
into the stone basin i snipped
an orange bud, pocketed it when
it had opened its orange in my vase,
retrogressed to blowze, i next chose red
argued my conscience clear which robbed
the park of less red than withering did
musk satisfied my nose, red my eye,
the petals nap my fingertips
i considered the poetry i rescued
from blind air, from complete eclipse
yet today, a yellow bud in my hand,
i stalled at sudden noisy crashes
from the laurel thicket no one approached
a spasm took the rhododendron bushes

three girls, engrossed, were wrenching full clusters
of cerise and pink from the rhododendron,
mountaining them on spread newspaper
they brassily picked, slowed by no chagrin,
and wouldnt pause for my straight look
but gave me pause, my rose a charge,
whether nicety stood confounded by love,
or petty thievery by large
the death of mythmaking
two virtues ride, by stallion, by nag,
to grind our knives and scissors
lanternjawed reason, squat common sense,
one courting doctors of all sorts,
one, housewives and shopkeepers
the trees are lopped, the poodles trim,
the laborers nails pared level
since those two civil servants set
their whetstone to the blunted edge
and minced the muddling devil
whose owleyes in the scraggly wood
scared mothers to miscarry,
drove the dogs to cringe and whine,
and turned the farmboys temper wolfish,
the housewifes, desultory
green rock, winthrop bay
no lame excuses can gloss over
bargetar clotted at the tideline, the wrecked pier
i should have known better

fifteen years between me and the bay
profited memory, but did away with the old scenery
and patched this shoddy
makeshift of a view to quit
my promise of an idyll, the blues worn out
its a niggard estate,
inimical now the great green rock
we gave good use as ship and house is black
with tarry muck
and periwinkles, shrunk to common
size the cries of scavenging gulls sound thin
in the traffic of planes
from logan airport opposite
gulls circle gray under shadow of a steelier flight
loss cancels profit
unless you do this tawdry harbor
a service and ignore it, i go a liar
gilding whats eyesore,
or must take loophole and blame time
for the rocks dwarfed lump, for the drabbled scum,
for a churlish welcome

t h e companionable ills
the noseend that twitches, the old imperfections
tolerable now as moles on the face
put up with until chagrin gives place
to a wry complaisance
dug in first as gods spurs
to start the spirit out of the mud
it stabled in longused, became wellloved
bedfellows of the spirits debauch, fond masters

i want, i want
openmouthed, the baby god
immense, bald, though babyheaded,
cried out for the mothers dug
the dry volcanoes cracked and spit,
sand abraded the milkless lip
cried then for the fathers blood
who set wasp, wolf and shark to work,
engineered the gannets beak
dryeyed, the inveterate patriarch
raised his men of skin and bone,
barbs on the crown of gilded wire,
thorns on the bloody rosestem
poems, potatoes
the word, defining, muzzles the drawn line
ousts mistier peers and thrives, murderous,
in establishments which imagined lines
can only haunt sturdy as potatoes,
stones, without conscience, word and line endure,
given an inch not that theyre gross although
afterthought often would have them alter
to delicacy, to poise but that they
shortchange me continuously whether
more or other, they still dissatisfy
unpoemed, unpictured, the potato
bunches its knobby browns on a vastly
superior page the blunt stone also

the times are tidy
unlucky the hero born
in this province of the stuck record
where the most watchful cooks go jobless
and the mayors rotisserie turns
round of its own accord
theres no career in the venture
of riding against the lizard,
himself withered these latterdays
to leafsize from lack of action
historys beaten the hazard
the last crone got burnt up
more than eight decades back
with the lovehot herb, the talking cat,
but the children are better for it,
the cow milks cream an inch thick

the bull of bendylaw
the black bull bellowed before the sea
the sea, till that day orderly,
hove up against bendylaw
the queen in the mulberry arbor stared
stiff as a queen on a playing card
the king fingered his beard
a blue sea, four horny bullfeet,
a bullsnouted sea that wouldnt stay put,
bucked at the garden gate
along boxlined walks in the florid sun
toward the rowdy bellow and back again
the lords and ladies ran
the great bronze gate began to crack,
the sea broke in at every crack,
pellmell, blueblack
the bull surged up, the bull surged down,
not to be stayed by a daisy chain
nor by any learned man
o the kings tidy acre is under the sea,
and the royal rose in the bulls belly,
and the bull on the kings highway

the eyemote
blameless as daylight i stood looking
at a field of horses, necks bent, manes blown,
tails streaming against the green
backdrop of sycamores sun was striking
while chapel pinnacles over the roofs,
holding the horses, the clouds, the leaves
steadily rooted though they were all flowing
away to the left like reeds in a sea
when the splinter flew in and stuck my eye,
needling it dark then i was seeing
a melding of shapes in a hot rain
horses warped on the altering green,
outlandish as doublehumped camels or unicorns,
grazing at the margins of a bad monochrome,
beasts of oasis, a better time
abrading my lid, the small grain burns
red cinder around which i myself,
horses, planets and spires revolve
neither tears nor the easing flush
of eyebaths can unseat the speck
it sticks, and it has stuck a week
i wear the present itch for flesh,
blind to what will be and what was
i dream that i am oedipus
what i want back is what i was
before the bed, before the knife,
before the broochpin and the salve
fixed me in this parenthesis
horses fluent in the wind,
a place, a time gone out of mind

point shirley
from watertower hill to the brick prison
the shingle booms, bickering under
the seas collapse
snowcakes break and welter this year
the gritted wave leaps
the seawall and drops onto a bier
of quahog chips,
leaving a salty mash of ice to whiten
in my grandmothers sand yard she is dead,
whose laundry snapped and froze here, who
kept house against
what the sluttish, rutted sea could do
squall waves once danced
ship timbers in through the cellar window
a threshtailed, lanced
shark littered in the geranium bed
such collusion of mulish elements
she wore her broom straws to the nub
twenty years out
of her hand, the house still hugs in each drab
stucco socket
the purple eggstones from great heads knob
to the filledin gut
the sea in its cold gizzard ground those rounds
nobody wintering now behind
the plankedup windows where she set
her wheat loaves
and apple cakes to cool what is it
survives, grieves
so, over this battered, obstinate spit
of gravel ? the waves
spewed relics clicker masses in the wind,
grey waves the stubnecked eiders ride
a labor of love, and that labor lost
steadily the sea
no
eats at point shirley she died blessed,
and i come by
bones, bones only, pawed and tossed,
a dogfaced sea
the sun sinks under boston, bloody red
i would get from these drypapped stones
the milk your love instilled in them
the black ducks dive
and though your graciousness might stream,
and i contrive,
grandmother, stones are nothing of home
to that spumiest dove
against both bar and tower the black sea runs
goatsucker
old goatherds swear how all night long they hear
the warning whirr and burring of the bird
who wakes with darkness and till dawn works hard
vampiring dry of milk each great goat udder
moon full, moon dark, the chary dairy farmer
dreams that his fattest cattle dwindle, fevered
by clawcuts of the goatsucker, alias devilbird,
its eye, flashlit, a chip of ruby fire
so fablis say the goatsucker moves, masked from mens sight
in an ebony air, on wings of witch cloth,
wellnamed, illfamed a knavish flybynight,
yet it never milked any goat, nor dealt cow death
and shadows onlycavemouth bristle beset
cockchafers and the wan, green luna moth
watercolor of grantchester meadows
there, spring lambs jam the sheepfold in air
stilled, silvered as water in a glass
nothing is big or far
i n
the small shrew chitters from its wilderness
of grassheads and is heard
each thumbsize bird
flits nimblewinged in thickets, and of good color
cloudwrack and owlhollowed willows slanting over
the bland granta double their white and green
world under the sheer water
and ride that flux at anchor, upside down
the punter sinks his pole
in byrons pool
cattails part where the tame cygnets steer
it is a country on a nursery plate
spotted cows revolve their jaws and crop
red clover or gnaw beetroot
bellied on a nimbus of sunglazed buttercup
hedging meadows of benign
arcadian green
the bloodberried hawthorn hides its spines with white
droll, vegetarian, the water rat
saws down a reed and swims from his limber grove,
while the students stroll or sit,
hands laced, in a moony indolence of love
blackgowned, but unaware
how in such mild air
the owl shall stoop from his turret, the rat cry out
ig february igg

a winter ship
at this wharf there are no grand landings to speak of
red and orange barges list and blister
shackled to the dock, outmoded, gaudy,
and apparently indestructible
the sea pulses under a skin of oil

a gull holds his pose on a shanty ridgepole,
riding the tide of the wind, steady
as wood and formal, in a jacket of ashes,
the whole flat harbor anchored in
the round of his yellow eyebutton
a blimp swims up like a daymoon or tin
cigar over his rink of fishes
the prospect is dull as an old etching
they are unloading three barrels of little crabs
the pier pilings seem about to collapse
and with them that rickety edifice
of warehouses, derricks, smokestacks and bridges
in the distance all around us the water slips
and gossips in its loose vernacular,
ferrying the smells of dead cod and tar
farther out, the waves will be mouthing icecakes
a poor month for parksleepers and lovers
even our shadows are blue with cold
we wanted to see the sun come up
and are met, instead, by this iceribbed ship,
bearded and blown, an albatross of frost,
relic of tough weather, every winch and stay
encased in a glassy pellicle
the sun will diminish it soon enough
each wavetip glitters like a knife

aftermath
compelled by calamitys magnet
they loiter and stare as if the house
burntout were theirs, or as if they thought
some scandal might any minute ooze
from a smokechoked closet into light
no deaths, no prodigious injuries
glut these hunters after an old meat,
bloodspoor of the austere tragedies

mother medea in a green smock
moves humbly as any housewife through
her ruined apartments, taking stock
of charred shoes, the sodden upholstery
cheated of the pyre and the rack,
the crowd sucks her last tear and turns away
two views of a cadaver room
i
the day she visited the dissecting room
they had four men laid out, black as burnt turkey,
already half unstrung a vinegary fume
of the death vats clung to them
the whitesmocked boys started working
the head of his cadaver had caved in,
and she could scarcely make out anything
in that rubble of skull plates and old leather
a sallow piece of string held it together
in their jars the snailnosed babies moon and glow
he hands her the cutout heart like a cracked heirloom

in brueghels panorama of smoke and slaughter
two people only are blind to the carrion army
he, afloat in the sea of her blue satin
skirts, sings in the direction
of her bare shoulder, while she bends,
fingering a leaflet of music, over him,
both of them deaf to the fiddle in the hands
of the deathshead shadowing their song
these flemish lovers flourish not for long
yet desolation, stalled in paint, spares the little country
foolish, delicate, in the lower right hand corner


suicide off egg rock
behind him the hotdogs split and drizzled
on the public grills, and the ochreous salt flats,
gas tanks, factory stacksthat landscape
of imperfections his bowels were part of
rippled and pulsed in the glassy updraught
sun struck the water like a damnation
no pit of shadow to crawl into,
and his blood beating the old tattoo
i am, i am, i am children
were squealing where combers broke and the spindrift
raveled windripped from the crest of the wave
a mongrel working his legs to a gallop
hustled a gull flock to flap off the sandspit
he smoldered, as if stonedeaf, blindfold,
his body beached with the seas garbage,
a machine to breathe and beat forever
flies filing in through a dead skates eyehole
buzzed and assailed the vaulted brainchamber
the words in his book wormed off the pages
everything glittered like blank paper
everything shrank in the suns corrosive
ray but egg rock on the blue wastage
he heard when he walked into the water
the forgetful surf creaming on those ledges

the ravaged face
outlandish as a circus, the ravaged face
parades the marketplace, lurid and stricken
by some unutterable chagrin,
maudlin from leaky eye to swollen nose
two pinlegs stagger underneath the mass
grievously purpled, mouth skewered on a groan,
past keeping to the house, past all discretion
myself, myselfobscene, lugubrious
ii
better the flat leer of the idiot,
the stone face of the man who doesnt feel,
the velvet dodges of the hypocrite
better, better, and more acceptable
to timorous children, to the lady on the street
o oedipus o christ you use me ill
ig march
metaphors
im a riddle in nine syllables,
an elephant, a ponderous house,
a melon strolling on two tendrils
o red fruit, ivory, fine timbers
this loafs big with its yeasty rising
moneys newminted in this fat purse
im a means, a stage, a cow in calf
ive eaten a bag of green apples,
boarded the train theres no getting off

electra on azalea path
the day you died i went into the dirt,
into the lightless hibernaculum
where bees, striped black and gold, sleep out the blizzard
like hieratic stones, and the ground is hard
it was good for twenty years, that wintering
as if you had never existed, as if i came
godfathered into the world from my mothers belly
her wide bed wore the stain of divinity
i had nothing to do with guilt or anything
when i wormed back under my mothers heart
small as a doll in my dress of innocence
i lay dreaming your epic, image by image
nobody died or withered on that stage

everything took place in a durable whiteness
the day i woke, i woke on churchyard hill
i found your name, i found your bones and all
enlisted in a cramped necropolis,
your speckled stone askew by an iron fence
in this charity ward, this poorhouse, where the dead
crowd foot to foot, head to head, no flower
breaks the soil this is azalea path
a field of burdock opens to the south
six feet of yellow gravel cover you
the artificial red sage does not stir
in the basket of plastic evergreens they put
at the headstone next to yours, nor does it rot,
although the rains dissolve a bloody dye
the ersatz petals drip, and they drip red
another kind of redness bothers me
the day your slack sail drank my sisters breath
the flat sea purpled like that evil cloth
my mother unrolled at your last homecoming
i borrow the stilts of an old tragedy
the truth is, one late october, at my birthcry
a scorpion stung its head, an illstarred thing
my mother dreamed you face down in the sea
the stony actors poise and pause for breath
i brought my love to bear, and then you died
it was the gangrene ate you to the bone
my mother said you died like any man
how shall i age into that state of mind ?
i am the ghost of an infamous suicide,
my own blue razor rusting in my throat
o pardon the one who knocks for pardon at
your gate, fatheryour houndbitch, daughter, friend
it was my love that did us both to death

the beekeepers daughter
a garden of mouthings purple, scarletspeckled, black
the great corollas dilate, peeling back their silks
their musk encroaches, circle after circle,
a well of scents almost too dense to breathe in
hieratical in your frock coat, maestro of the bees,
you move among the manybreasted hives,
my heart under your foot, sister of a stone
trumpetthroats open to the beaks of birds
the golden rain tree drips its powders down
in these little boudoirs streaked with orange and red
the anthers nod their heads, potent as kings
to father dynasties the air is rich
here is a queenship no mother can contest
a fruit thats death to taste dark flesh, dark parings
in burrows narrow as a finger, solitary bees
keep house among the grasses kneeling down
i set my eye to a holemouth and meet an eye
round, green, disconsolate as a tear
father, bridegroom, in this easter egg
under the coronal of sugar roses
the queen bee marries the winter of your year
the hermit at outermost house
sky and sea, horizonhinged
tablets of blank blue, couldnt,
clapped shut, flatten this man out
the great gods, stonehead, clawfoot,
winded by much rockbumping
and clawthreat, realized that

for what, then, had they endured
dourly the long hots and colds,
those old despots, if he sat
laughshaken on his doorsill,
backbone unbendable as
timbers of his upright hut?
hard gods were there, nothing else
still he thumbed out something else
thumbed no stony, horny pot,
but a certain meaning green
he withstood them, that hermit
rockface, crabclaw verged on green
gulls mulled in the greenest light
man in black
where the three magenta
breakwaters take the shove
and suck of the gray sea
to the left, and the wave
unfists against the dun
barbwired headland of
the deer island prison
with its trim piggeries,
hen huts and cattle green
to the right, and march ice
glazes the rock pools yet,
snuffcolored sand cliffs rise
over a great stone spit
bared by each falling tide,
and you, across those white

stones, strode out in your dead
black coat, black shoes, and your
black hair till there you stood,
fixed vortex on the far
tip, riveting stones, air,
all of it, together
old ladies home
sharded in black, like beetles,
frail as antique earthenware
one breath might shiver to bits,
the old women creep out here
to sun on the rocks or prop
themselves up against the wall
whose stones keep a little heat
needles knit in a birdbeaked
counterpoint to their voices
sons, daughters, daughters and sons,
distant and cold as photos,
grandchildren nobody knows
age wears the best black fabric
rustred or green as lichens
at owlcall the old ghosts flock
to hustle them off the lawn
from beds boxedin like coffins
the bonneted ladies grin
and death, that baldhead buzzard,
stalls in halls where the lamp wick
shortens with each breath drawn

the netmenders
halfway up from the little harbor of sardine boats,
halfway down from groves where the thin, bitter almond pips
fatten in greenpocked pods, the three netmenders sit out,
dressed in black, everybody in mourning for someone
they set their stout chairs back to the road and face the dark
dominoes of their doorways
sun grains their crowcolors,
purples the fig in the leafs shadow, turns the dust pink
on the road named for tomas ortunio, mica
winks like money under the ringed toes of the chickens
the houses are white as seasalt goats lick from the rocks
while their fingers work with the coarse mesh and the fine
their eyes revolve the whole town like a blue and green ball
nobody dies or is born without their knowing it
they talk of bridelace, of lovers spunky as gamecocks
the moon leans, a stone madonna, over the lead sea
and the iron hills that enclose them earthen fingers
twist old words into the webthreads
tonight may the fish
be a harvest of silver in the nets, and the lamps
of our husbands and sons move sure among the low stars
magnolia shoals
up here among the gull cries
we stroll through a maze of pale
redmottled relics, shells, claws
as if it were summer still
that season has turned its back
though the green sea gardens stall,

bow, and recover their look
of the imperishable
gardens in an antique book
or tapestries on a wall,
leaves behind us warp and lapse
the late month withers, as well
below us a white gull keeps
the weedslicked shelf for his own,
hustles other gulls off crabs
rove over his field of stone
mussels cluster blue as grapes
his beak brings the harvest in
the watercolorist grips
his brush in the stringent air
the horizons bare of ships,
the beach and the rocks are bare
he paints a blizzard of gulls,
wings drumming in the winter
october
no
the sleepers
no map traces the street
where those two sleepers are
we have lost track of it
they lie as if under water
in a blue, unchanging light,
the french window ajar
curtained with yellow lace
through the narrow crack
odors of wet earth rise
the snail leaves a silver track

dark thickets hedge the house
we take a backward look
among petals pale as death
and leaves steadfast in shape
they sleep on, mouth to mouth
a white mist is going up
the small green nostrils breathe,
and they turn in their sleep
ousted from that warm bed
we are a dream they dream
their eyelids keep the shade
no harm can come to them
we cast our skins and slide
into another time
yaddo the grand manor
woodsmoke and a distant loudspeaker
filter into this clear
air, and blur
the red tomatos in, the green bean
the cook lugs a pumpkin
from the vine
for pies the fir trees thick with grackles
gold carp loom in the pools
a wasp crawls
over windfalls to sip ciderjuice
guests in the studios
muse, compose
indoors, tiffanys phoenix rises
above the fireplace
two carved sleighs

rest on orange plush near the newel post
wood stoves burn warm as toast
the late guest
wakens, mornings, to a cobalt sky,
a diamondpaned window,
zincwhite snow
medallion
by the gate with star and moon
worked into the peeled orange wood
t h e bronze snake lay in the sun
inert as a shoelace dead
but pliable still, his jaw
unhinged and his grin crooked,
tongue a rosecolored arrow
over my hand i hung him
his little vermilion eye
ignited with a glassed flame
as i turned him in the light
when i split a rock one time
the garnet bits burned like that
dust dulled his back to ochre
the way sun ruins a trout
yet his belly kept its fire
going under the chainmail,
the old jewels smoldering there
in each opaque bellyscale
sunset looked at through milk glass
and i saw white maggots coil

thin as pins in the dark bruise
where his innards bulged as if
he were digesting a mouse
knifelike, he was chaste enough,
pure deathsmetal the yardmans
flung brick perfected his laugh
the manor garden
the fountains are dry and the roses over
incense of death your day approaches
the pears fatten like little buddhas
a blue mist is dragging the lake
you move through the era of fishes,
the smug centuries of the pig
head, toe and finger
come clear of the shadow history
nourishes these broken flutings,
these crowns of acanthus,
and the crow settles her garments
you inherit white heather, a bees wing,
two suicides, the family wolves,
hours of blankness some hard stars
already yellow the heavens
the spider on its own string
crosses the lake the worms
quit their usual habitations
the small birds converge, converge
with their gifts to a difficult borning

u
blue moles
d
theyre out of the darks ragbag, these two
moles dead in the pebbled rut,
shapeless as flung gloves, a few feet apart
blue suede a dog or fox has chewed
one, by himself, seemed pitiable enough,
little victim unearthed by some large creature
from his orbit under the elm root
the second carcass makes a duel of the affair
blind twins bitten by bad nature
the skys far dome is sane and clear
leaves, undoing their yellow caves
between the road and the lake water,
bare no sinister spaces already
the moles look neutral as the stones
their corkscrew noses, their white hands
uplifted, stiffen in a family pose
difficult to imagine how fury struck
dissolved now, smoke of an old war

nightly the battleshouts start up
in the ear of the veteran, and again
i enter the soft pelt of the mole
lights death to them they shrivel in it
they move through their mute rooms while i sleep,
palming the earth aside, grubbers
after the fat children of root and rock
by day, only the topsoil heaves
down there one is alone
outsize hands prepare a path,
they go before opening the veins,
delving for the appendages
of beetles, sweetbreads, shardsto be eaten

over and over and still the heaven
of final surfeit is just as far
from the door as ever what happens between
happens in darkness, vanishes
easy and often as each breath
dark wood, dark water
this wood burns a dark
incense pale moss drips
in elbowscarves, beards
from the archaic
bones of the great trees
blue mists move over
a lake thick with fish
snails scroll the border
of the glazed water
with coils of ramshorn
out in the open
down there the late year
hammers her rare and
various metals
old pewter roots twist
up from the jetbacked
mirror of water
and while the airs clear
hourglass sifts a
drift of goldpieces
bright waterlights are
sliding their quoits one
after the other
down boles of the fir

pollys tree
a dream tree, pollys tree
a thicket of sticks,
each speckled twig
ending in a thinpaned
leaf unlike any
other on it
or in a ghost flower
flat as paper and
of a color
vaporish as frostbreath,
more finical than
any silk fan
the chinese ladies use
to stir robins egg
air the silver
haired seed of the milkweed
comes to roost there, frail
as the halo
rayed round a candle flame,
a willothewisp
nimbus, or puff
of cloudstuff, tipping her
queer candelabrum
palely lit by
snuffruffed dandelions,
white daisy wheels and
a tigerfaced
pansy, it glows o its
no family tree,
pollys tree, nor

a tree of heaven, though
it marry quartzflake,
feather and rose
it sprang from her pillow
whole as a cobweb,
ribbed like a hand,
a dream tree pollys tree
wears a valentine
arc of tearpearled
bleeding hearts on its sleeve
and, crowning it, one
blue larkspur star
the colossus
i shall never get you put together entirely,
pieced, glued, and properly jointed
mulebray, piggrunt and bawdy cackles
proceed from your great lips
its worse than a barnyard
perhaps you consider yourself an oracle,
mouthpiece of the dead, or of some god or other
thirty years now i have labored
to dredge the silt from your throat
i am none the wiser
scaling little ladders with gluepots and pails of lysol
i crawl like an ant in mourning
over the weedy acres of your brow
to mend the immense skullplates and clear
the bald, white tumuli of your eyes
a blue sky out of the oresteia
arches above us o father, all by yourself
you are pithy and historical as the roman forum

i open my lunch on a hill of black cypress
your fluted bones and acanthine hair are littered
in their old anarchy to the horizonline
it would take more than a lightningstroke
t o create such a ruin
nights, i squat in the cornucopia
of your left ear, out of the wind,
counting the red stars and those of plumcolor
the sun rises under the pillar of your tongue
my hours are married to shadow
no longer do i listen for the scrape of a keel
on the blank stones of the landing
private ground
first frost, and i walk among the rosefruit, the marble toes
of the greek beauties you brought
off europes relic heap
t o sweeten your neck of the new york woods
soon each white lady will be boarded up
against the cracking climate
all morning, with smoking breath, the handyman
has been draining the goldfish ponds
they collapse like lungs, the escaped water
threading back, filament by filament, to the pure
platonic table where it lives the baby carp
litter the mud like orangepeel
eleven weeks, and i know your estate so well
i need hardly go out at all
a superhighway seals me off
trading their poisons, the north and south bound cars
flatten the doped snakes to ribbon in here, the grasses
unload their griefs on my shoes,

the woods creak and ache, and the day forgets itself
i bend over this drained basin where the small fish
flex as the mud freezes
they glitter like eyes, and i collect them all
morgue of old logs and old images, the lake
opens and shuts, accepting them among its reflections
poem for a birthday
who
the month of flowerings finished the fruits in,
eaten or rotten i am all mouth
octobers the month for storage
this sheds fusty as a mummys stomach
old tools, handles and rusty tusks
i am at home here among the dead heads
let me sit in a flowerpot,
the spiders wont notice
my heart is a stopped geranium
if only the wind would leave my lungs alone
dogbody noses the petals they bloom upside down
they rattle like hydrangea bushes
moldering heads console me,
nailed to the rafters yesterday
inmates who dont hibernate
cabbageheads wormy purple, silverglaze,
a dressing of mule ears, mothy pelts, but greenhearted,
their veins white as porkfat
o the beauty of usage
the orange pumpkins have no eyes
these halls are full of women who think they are birds

this is a dull school
i am a root, a stone, an owl pellet,
without dreams of any sort
mother, you are the one mouth
i would be a tongue to mother of otherness
eat me wastebasket gaper, shadow of doorway
i said i must remember this, being small
there were such enormous flowers,
purple and red mouths, utterly lovely
the hoops of blackberry stems made me cry
now they light me up like an electric bulb
for weeks i can remember nothing at all
dark house
this is a dark house, very big
i made it myself,
cell by cell from a quiet corner,
chewing at the gray paper,
oozing the glue drops,
whistling, wiggling my ears,
thinking of something else
it has so many cellars,
such eelish delvings
i am round as an owl,
i see by my own light
any day i may litter puppies
or mother a horse my belly moves
i must make more maps
these marrowy tunnels
moleyhanded, i eat my way
allmouth licks up the bushes
and the pots of meat
he lives in an old well,
a stony hole hes to blame
hes a fat sort

pebble smells, turnipy chambers
small nostrils are breathing
little humble loves
footlings, boneless as noses,
it is warm and tolerable
in the bowel of the root
heres a cuddly mother
j  maenad
once i was ordinary
sat by my fathers bean tree
eating the fingers of wisdom
the birds made milk
when it thundered i hid under a flat stone
the mother of mouths didnt love me
the old man shrank to a doll
i am too big to go backward
birdmilk is feathers,
the bean leaves are dumb as hands
this month is fit for little
the dead ripen in the grapeleaves
a red tongue is among us
mother, keep out of my barnyard,
am becoming another
doghead, devourer
feed me the berries of dark
the lids wont shut time
unwinds from the great umbilicus of the sun
its endless glitter
i must swallow it all
lady, who are these others in the moons vat
sleepdrunk, their limbs at odds ?
in this light the blood is black
tell me my name

q the beast
he was bullman earlier,
king of the dish, my lucky animal
breathing was easy in his airy holding
the sun sat in his armpit
nothing went moldy the little invisibles
waited on him hand and foot
the blue sisters sent me to another school
monkey lived under the dunce cap
he kept blowing me kisses
i hardly knew him
he wont be got rid of
mumblepaws, teary and sorry,
fido littlesoul, the bowels familiar
a dustbins enough for him
the darks his bone
call him any name, hell come to it
mudsump, happy styface
ive married a cupboard of rubbish
i bed in a fish puddle
down here the sky is always falling
hogwallows at the window
the star bugs wont save me this month
i housekeep in times gutend
among emmets and mollusks,
duchess of nothing,
hairtusks bride
flute notes from a reedy pond
now coldness comes sifting down, layer after layer,
to our bower at the lily root
overhead the old umbrellas of summer
wither like pithless hands there is little shelter
hourly the eye of the sky enlarges its blank
dominion the stars are no nearer
already frogmouth and fishmouth drink
the liquor of indolence, and all things sink

into a soft caul of forgetfulness
the fugitive colors die
caddis worms drowse in their silk cases,
the lampheaded nymphs are nodding to sleep like statues
puppets, loosed from the strings of the puppetmaster,
wear masks of horn to bed
this is not death, it is something safer
the wingy myths wont tug at us any more
the molts are tongueless that sang from above the water
of golgotha at the tip of a reed,
and how a god flimsy as a babys finger
shall unhusk himself and steer into the air
witch burning
in the marketplace they are piling the dry sticks
a thicket of shadows is a poor coat i inhabit
the wax image of myself, a dolls body
sickness begins here i am a dartboard for witches
only the devil can eat the devil out
in the month of red leaves i climb to a bed of fire
it is easy to blame the dark the mouth of a door,
the cellars belly theyve blown my sparkler out
a blacksharded lady keeps me in a parrot cage
what large eyes the dead have
i am intimate with a hairy spirit
smoke wheels from the beak of this empty jar
if i am a little one, i can do no harm
if i dont move about, ill knock nothing over so i said,
sitting under a potlid, tiny and inert as a rice grain
they are turning the burners up, ring after ring
we are full of starch, my small white fellows we grow
it hurts at first the red tongues will teach the truth
mother of beetles, only unclench your hand
ill fly through the candles mouth like a singeless moth

give me back my shape i am ready to construe the days
i coupled with dust in the shadow of a stone
my ankles brighten brightness ascends my thighs
i am lost, i am lost, in the robes of all this light
the stones
this is the city where men are mended
i lie on a great anvil
the flat blue skycircle
flew off like the hat of a doll
when i fell out of the light i entered
the stomach of indifference, the wordless cupboard
the mother of pestles diminished me
i became a still pebble
the stones of the belly were peaceable,
the headstone quiet, jostled by nothing
only the mouthhole piped out,
importunate cricket
in a quarry of silences
the people of the city heard it
they hunted the stones, taciturn and separate,
the mouthhole crying their locations
drunk as a foetus
i suck at the paps of darkness
the food tubes embrace me sponges kiss my lichens away
the jewelmaster drives his chisel to pry
open one stone eye
this is the afterhell i see the light
a wind unstoppers the chamber
of the ear, old worrier

water mollifies the flint lip,
and daylight lays its sameness on the wall
the grafters are cheerful,
heating the pincers, hoisting the delicate hammers
a current agitates the wires
volt upon volt catgut stitches my fissures
a workman walks by carrying a pink torso
the storerooms are full of hearts
this is the city of spare parts
my swaddled legs and arms smell sweet as rubber
here they can doctor heads, or any limb
on fridays the little children come
to trade their hooks for hands
dead men leave eyes for others
love is the uniform of my bald nurse
love is the bone and sinew of my curse
the vase, reconstructed, houses
the elusive rose
ten fingers shape a bowl for shadows
my mendings itch there is nothing to do
i shall be good as new

the burntout spa
an old beast ended in this place
a monster of wood and rusty teeth
fire smelted his eyes to lumps
of pale blue vitreous stuff, opaque
as resin drops oozed from pine bark

the rafters and struts of his body wear
their char of karakul still i cant tell
how long his carcass has foundered under
the rubbish of summers, the blackleaved falls
now little weeds insinuate
soft suede tongues between his bones
his armorplate, his toppled stones
are an esplanade for crickets
i pick and pry like a doctor or
archaeologist among
iron entrails, enamel bowls,
the coils and pipes that made him run
the small dell eats what ate it once
and yet the ichor of the spring
proceeds clear as it ever did
from the broken throat, the marshy lip
it flows off below the green and white
balustrade of a sagbacked bridge
leaning over, i encounter one
blue and improbable person
framed in a basketwork of cattails
o she is gracious and austere,
seated beneath the toneless water
it is not i, it is not i
no animal spoils on her green doorstep
and we shall never enter there
where the durable ones keep house
the stream that hustles us
neither nourishes nor heals

mushrooms
overnight, very
whitely, discreetly,
very quietly
our toes, our noses
take hold on the loam,
acquire the air
nobody sees us,
stops us, betrays us
the small grains make room
soft fists insist on
heaving the needles,
the leafy bedding,
even the paving
our hammers, our rams,
earless and eyeless,
perfectly voiceless,
widen the crannies,
shoulder through holes we
diet on water,
on crumbs of shadow,
blandmannered, asking
little or nothing
so many of us
so many of us
we are shelves, we are
tables, we are meek,
we are edible,
nudgers and shovers
in spite of ourselves
our kind multiplies

we shall by morning
inherit the earth
our foots in the door

trawling your dark as owls do
mute as a turnip from the fourth
of july to all fools day,
o highriser, my little loaf
vague as fog and looked for like mail
farther off than australia
bentbacked atlas, our traveled prawn
snug as a bud and at home
like a sprat in a pickle jug
a creel of eels, all ripples
jumpy as a mexican bean
right, like a welldone sum
a clean slate, with your own face on

these poems do not live its a sad diagnosis
they grew their toes and fingers well enough,
their little foreheads bulged with concentration
if they missed out on walking about like people
it wasnt for any lack of motherlove
o i cannot understand what happened to them
they are proper in shape and number and every part
they sit so nicely in the pickling fluid
they smile and smile and smile and smile at me
and still the lungs wont fill and the heart wont start
they are not pigs, they are not even fish,
though they have a piggy and a fishy air
it would be better if they were alive, and thats what they were
but they are dead, and their mother near dead with distraction,
and they stupidly stare, and do not speak of her

midnight in the midatlantic on deck
wrapped up in themselves as in thick veiling
and mute as mannequins in a dress shop,
some few passengers keep track

tiny and far, a single ship
lit like a twotiered wedding cake
carries its candles slowly off
now there is nothing much to look at
still nobody will move or speak
the bingo players, the players at love
on a square no bigger than a carpet

hell be rich in a year and he should know

sleep in the mojave desert
out here there are no hearthstones,
hot grains, simply it is dry, dry
and the air dangerous noonday acts queerly
on the minds eye, erecting a line
of poplars in the middle distance, the only
object beside the mad, straight road
one can remember men and houses by

a cool wind should inhabit those leaves
and a dew collect on them, dearer than money,
in the blue hour before sunup
yet they recede, untouchable as tomorrow,
or those glittery fictions of spilt water
that glide ahead of the very thirsty
i think of the lizards airing their tongues
in the crevice of an extremely small shadow
and the toad guarding his hearts droplet
the desert is white as a blind mans eye,
comfortless as salt snake and bird
doze behind the old masks of fury
we swelter like firedogs in the wind
the sun puts its cinder out where we lie
the heatcracked crickets congregate
in their black armorplate and cry
the daymoon lights up like a sorry mother,
and the crickets come creeping into our hair
to fiddle the short night away

two campers in cloud country
rock lake, canada
in this country there is neither measure nor balance
to redress the dominance of rocks and woods,
the passage, say, of these manshaming clouds
no gesture of yours or mine could catch their attention,
no word make them carry water or fire the kindling
like local trolls in the spell of a superior being
well, one wearies of the public gardens one wants a vacatior
where trees and clouds and animals pay no notice
away from the labeled elms, the tame tearoses
igo
it took three days driving north to find a cloud
the polite skies over boston couldnt possibly accommodate
here on the last frontier of the big, brash spirit
the horizons are too far off to be chummy as uncles
the colors assert themselves with a sort of vengeance
each day concludes in a huge splurge of vermilions
and night arrives in one gigantic step
it is comfortable, for a change, to mean so little
these rocks offer no purchase to herbage or people
they are conceiving a dynasty of perfect cold
in a month well wonder what plates and forks are for
i lean to you, numb as a fossil tell me im here
the pilgrims and indians might never have happened
planets pulse in the lake like bright amoebas
the pines blot our voices up in their lightest sighs
around our tent the old simplicities sough
sleepily as lethe, trying to get in
well wake blankbrained as water in the dawn

leaving early
lady, your room is lousy with flowers
when you kick me out, thats what ill remember,
me, sitting here bored as a leopard
in your jungle of winebottle lamps,
velvet pillows the colour of blood pudding
and the white china flying fish from italy
i forget you, hearing the cut flowers
sipping their liquids from assorted pots,
pitchers and coronation goblets
like monday drunkards the milky berries
bow down, a local constellation,
higo
toward their admirers in the tabletop
mobs of eyeballs looking up
are those petals or leaves youve paired them with
those greenstriped ovals of silver tissue ?
the red geraniums i know
friends, friends they stink of armpits
and the involved maladies of autumn,
musky as a lovebed the morning after
my nostrils prickle with nostalgia
henna hags cloth of your cloth
they toe old water thick as fog
the roses in the toby jug
gave up the ghost last night high time
their yellow corsets were ready to split
you snored, and i heard the petals unlatch,
tapping and ticking like nervous fingers
you should have junked them before they died
daybreak discovered the bureau lid
littered with chinese hands now im stared at
by chrysanthemums the size
of holofernes head, dipped in the same
magenta as this fubsy sofa
in the mirror their doubles back them up
listen your tenant mice
are rattling the cracker packets fine flour
muffles their birdfeet they whistle for joy
and you doze on, nose to the wall
this mizzle fits me like a sad jacket
how did we make it up to your attic ?
you handed me gin in a glass bud vase
we slept like stones lady, what am i doing
with a lung full of dust and a tongue of wood,
kneedeep in the cold and swamped by flowers ?

love letter
not easy to state the change you made
if im alive now, then i was dead,
though, like a stone, unbothered by it,
staying put according to habit
you didnt just toe me an inch, no
nor leave me to set my small bald eye
skyward again, without hope, of course,
of apprehending blueness, or stars
that wasnt it i slept, say a snake
masked among black rocks as a black rock
in the white hiatus of winter
like my neighbors, taking no pleasure
in the million perfectlychiseled
cheeks alighting each moment to melt
my cheek of basalt they turned to tears,
angels weeping over dull natures,
but didnt convince me those tears froze
each dead head had a visor of ice
and i slept on like a bent finger
the first thing i saw was sheer air
and the locked drops rising in a dew
limpid as spirits many stones lay
dense and expressionless round about
i didnt know what to make of it
i shone, micascaled, and unfolded
to pour myself out like a fluid
among bird feet and the stems of plants
i wasnt fooled i knew you at once
tree and stone glittered, without shadows
my fingerlength grew lucent as glass
i started to bud like a march twig
an arm and a leg, an arm, a leg
from stone to cloud, so i ascended
now i resemble a sort of god
floating through the air in my soulshift
pure as a pane of ice its a gift

magi
the abstracts hover like dull angels
nothing so vulgar as a nose or an eye
bossing the ethereal blanks of their faceovals
their whiteness bears no relation to laundry,
snow, chalk or suchlike theyre
the real thing, all right the good, the true
salutary and pure as boiled water,
loveless as the multiplication table
while the child smiles into thin air
six months in the world, and she is able
to rock on all fours like a padded hammock
for her, the heavy notion of evil
attending her cot is less than a belly ache,
and love the mother of milk, no theory
they mistake their star, these papery godfolk
they want the crib of some lampheaded plato
let them astound his heart with their merit
what girl ever flourished in such company ?

candles
they are the last romantics, these candles
upside down hearts of light tipping wax fingers,
and the fingers, taken in by their own haloes,
grown milky, almost clear, like the bodies of saints
it is touching, the way theyll ignore
a whole family of prominent objects
simply to plumb the deeps of an eye
in its hollow of shadows, its fringe of reeds,
and the owner past thirty, no beauty at all
daylight would be more judicious,
igo
giving everybody a fair hearing
they should have gone out with balloon flights and the stereopticon
this is no time for the private point of view
when i light them, my nostrils prickle
their pale, tentative yellows
drag up false, edwardian sentiments,
and i remember my maternal grandmother from vienna
as a schoolgirl she gave roses to franz josef
the burghers sweated and wept the children wore white
and my grandfather moped in the tyrol,
imagining himself a headwaiter in america,
floating in a highchurch hush
among ice buckets, frosty napkins
these little globes of light are sweet as pears
kindly with invalids and mawkish women,
they mollify the bald moon
nunsouled, they burn heavenward and never marry
the eyes of the child i nurse are scarcely open
in twenty years i shall be retrograde
as these draughty ephemerids
i watch their spilt tears cloud and dull to pearls
how shall i tell anything at all
to this infant still in a birthdrowse ?
tonight, like a shawl, the mild light enfolds her,
the shadows stoop over like guests at a christening

flick the glass with your fingernail
it will ping like a chinese chime in the slightest air stir
though nobody in there looks up or bothers to answer
the inhabitants are light as cork,
every one of them permanently busy
at their feet, the sea waves bow in single file,
never trespassing in bad temper
stalling in midair,
shortreined, pawing like paradeground horses
overhead, the clouds sit tasseled and fancy
as victorian cushions this family
of valentinefaces might please a collector
they ring true, like good china
elsewhere the landscape is more frank
the light falls without letup, blindingly
a woman is dragging her shadow in a circle
about a bald, hospital saucer
it resembles the moon, or a sheet of blank paper
and appears to have suffered a sort of private blitzkrieg
she lives quietly
with no attachments, like a foetus in a bottle,
the obsolete house, the sea, flattened to a picture
she has one too many dimensions to enter
grief and anger, exorcized,
leave her alone now
the future is a gray seagull
tattling in its catvoice of departure, departure
age and terror, like nurses, attend her,
and a drowned man, complaining of the great cold,
crawls up out of the sea

winter dawn is the color of metal,
the trees stiffen into place like burnt nerves
all night i have dreamed of destruction, annihilations
an assemblyline of cut throats, and you and i
inching off in the gray chevrolet, drinking the green
poison of stilled lawns, the little clapboard gravestones,
noiseless, on rubber wheels, on the way to the sea resort
how the balconies echoed how the sun lit up
the skulls, the unbuckled bones facing the view
space space the bed linen was giving out entirely
cot legs melted in terrible attitudes, and the nurses
each nurse patched her soul to a wound and disappeared
the deathly guests had not been satisfied
with the rooms, or the smiles, or the beautiful rubber plants,
or the sea, hushing their peeled sense like old mother morphia

parliament hill fields
on this bald hill the new year hones its edge
faceless and pale as china
the round sky goes on minding its business
your absence is inconspicuous
nobody can tell what i lack
gulls have threaded the rivers mud bed back

settling and stirring like blown paper
or the hands of an invalid the wan
sun manages to strike such tin glints
from the linked ponds that my eyes wince
and brim the city melts like sugar
a crocodile of small girls
knotting and stopping, illassorted, in blue uniforms,
opens to swallow me im a stone, a stick,
one child drops a barrette of pink plastic
none of them seem to notice
their shrill, gravelly gossips funneled off
now silence after silence offers itself
the wind stops my breath like a bandage
southward, over kentish town, an ashen smudge
swaddles roof and tree
it could be a snowfield or a cloudbank
i suppose its pointless to think of you at all
already your doll grip lets go

the tumulus, even at noon, guards its black shadow

ghost of a leaf, ghost of a bird

brood, rooted in their heaped losses
your cry fades like the cry of a gnat
i lose sight of you on your blind journey,
while the heath grass glitters and the spindling rivulets
unspool and spend themselves my mind runs with them,
pooling in heelprints, fumbling pebble and stem
the day empties its images
like a cup or a room the moons crook whitens,
thin as the skin seaming a scar
now, on the nursery wall,
the blue night plants, the little pale blue hill
in your sisters birthday picture start to glow
the orange pompons, the egyptian papyrus
light up each rabbiteared
blue shrub behind the glass
exhales an indigo nimbus,
a sort of cellophane balloon
the old dregs, the old difficulties take me to wife
gulls stiffen to their chill vigil in the drafty halflight
i enter the lit house

the armadillo dozed in his sandbin
obscene and bald as a pig, the white mice
multiplied to infinity like angels on a pinhead

you checked the diet charts and took me to play
with the boa constrictor in the fellows garden
i pretended i was the tree of knowledge
i entered your bible, i boarded your ark
with the sacred baboon in his wig and wax ears
and the bearfurred, birdeating spider
clambering round its glass box like an eightfingered hand

how our courtship lit the tindery cages
your twohorned rhinoceros opened a mouth

darkness wipes me out like chalk on a blackboard

old sockface, sagged on a darning egg

nodding and rocking and fingering her thin hair

smiling to themselves, they meditate
devoutly as the dutch bulb
forming its twenty petals
the dark still nurses its secret
on the green hill, under the thorn trees,
they listen for the millennium,
the knock of the small, new heart
pinkbuttocked infants attend them
looping wool, doing nothing in particular,
they step among the archetypes
dusk hoods them in maryblue
while far off, the axle of winter
grinds round, bearing down with the straw,

in plaster
i shall never get out of this there are two of me now
this new absolutely white person and the old yellow one,
and the white person is certainly the superior one
she doesnt need food, she is one of the real saints
at the beginning i hated her, she had no personality
she lay in bed with me like a dead body
and i was scared, because she was shaped just the way i was
only much whiter and unbreakable and with no complaints
i couldnt sleep for a week, she was so cold
iqi
i blamed her for everything, but she didnt answer
i couldnt understand her stupid behavior
when i hit her she held still, like a true pacifist
then i realized what she wanted was for me to love her
she began to warm up, and i saw her advantages
without me, she wouldnt exist, so of course she was grateful
i gave her a soul, i bloomed out of her as a rose
blooms out of a vase of not very valuable porcelain,
and it was i who attracted everybodys attention,
not her whiteness and beauty, as i had at first supposed
i patronized her a little, and she lapped it up
you could tell almost at once she had a slave mentality
i didnt mind her waiting on me, and she adored it
in the morning she woke me early, reflecting the sun
from her amazingly white torso, and i couldnt help but notice
her tidiness and her calmness and her patience
she humored my weakness like the best of nurses,
holding my bones in place so they would mend properly
in time our relationship grew more intense
she stopped fitting me so closely and seemed offish
i felt her criticizing me in spite of herself,
as if my habits offended her in some way
she let in the drafts and became more and more absentminded
and my skin itched and flaked away in soft pieces
simply because she looked after me so badly
then i saw what the trouble was she thought she was immortal
she wanted to leave me, she thought she was superior,
and id been keeping her in the dark, and she was resentful
wasting her days waiting on a halfcorpse
and secretly she began to hope id die
then she could cover my mouth and eyes, cover me entirely,
and wear my painted face the way a mummycase
wears the face of a pharaoh, though its made of mud and water
i wasnt in any position to get rid of her
shed supported me for so long i was quite limp
i had even forgotten how to walk or sit,
iiqi
so i was careful not to upset her in any way
or brag ahead of time how id avenge myself
living with her was like living with my own coffin
yet i still depended on her, though i did it regretfully
i used to think we might make a go of it together
after all, it was a kind of marriage, being so close
now i see it must be one or the other of us
she may be a saint, and i may be ugly and hairy,
but shell soon find out that that doesnt matter a bit
im collecting my strength one day i shall manage without her,
and shell perish with emptiness then, and begin to miss me

tulips
the tulips are too excitable, it is winter here
look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowedin
i am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly
as the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands
i am nobody i have nothing to do with explosions
i have given my name and my dayclothes up to the nurses
and my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons
they have propped my head between the pillow and the sheetcuff
like an eye between two white lids that will not shut
stupid pupil, it has to take everything in
the nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,
they pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,
doing things with their hands, one just the same as another,
so it is impossible to tell how many there are
my body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water
tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently
they bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep
now i have lost myself i am sick of baggage
my patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,
my husband and child smiling out of the family photo
their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks
iqi
i hav let things slip, a thirtyyearold cargo boat
stubbornly hanging on to my name and address
they have swabbed me clear of my loving associations
scared and bare on the green plasticpillowed trolley
i watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books
sink out of sight, and the water went over my head
i am a nun now, i have never been so pure
i didnt want any flowers, i only wanted
to lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty
how free it is, you have no idea how free
the peacefulness is so big it dazes you,
and it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets
it is what the dead close on, finally i imagine them
shutting their mouths on it, like a communion tablet
the tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me
even through the gift paper i could hear them breathe
lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby
their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds
they are subtle they seem to float, though they weigh me down,
upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,
a dozen red lead sinkers round my neck
nobody watched me before, now i am watched
the tulips turn to me, and the window behind me
where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,
and i see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cutpaper shadow
between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,
and i have no face, i have wanted to efface myself
the vivid tulips eat my oxygen
before they came the air was calm enough,
coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss
then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise
now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river
snags and eddies round a sunken rustred engine
they concentrate my attention, that was happy
playing and resting without committing itself
igi
the walls, also, seem to be warming themselves
the tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals
they are opening like the mouth of some great african cat,
and i am aware of my heart it opens and closes
its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me
the water i taste is warm and salt, like the sea,
and comes from a country far away as health
march igi
i
i am vertical
but i would rather be horizontal
i am not a tree with my root in the soil
sucking up minerals and motherly love
so that each march i may gleam into leaf,
nor am i the beauty of a garden bed
attracting my share of ahs and spectacularly painted,
unknowing i must soon unpetal
compared with me, a tree is immortal
and a flowerhead not tall, but more startling,
and i want the ones longevity and the others daring
tonight, in the infinitesimal light of the stars,
the trees and flowers have been strewing their cool odors
i walk among them, but none of them are noticing
sometimes i think that when i am sleeping
i must most perfectly resemble them
thoughts gone dim
it is more natural to me, lying down
then the sky and i are in open conversation,
and i shall be useful when i lie down finally
then the trees may touch me for once, and the flowers have time for me

insomniac
the night sky is only a sort of carbon paper,
blueblack, with the muchpoked periods of stars
letting in the light, peephole after peephole
a bonewhite light, like death, behind all things
under the eyes of the stars and the moons rictus
he suffers his desert pillow, sleeplessness
stretching its fine, irritating sand in all directions
over and over the old, granular movie
exposes embarrassmentsthe mizzling days
of childhood and adolescence, sticky with dreams,
parental faces on tall stalks, alternately stern and tearful,
a garden of buggy roses that made him cry
his forehead is bumpy as a sack of rocks
memories jostle each other for faceroom like obsolete film stars
he is immune to pills red, purple, blue
how they lit the tedium of the protracted evening
those sugary planets whose influence won for him
a life baptized in nolife for a while,
and the sweet, drugged waking of a forgetful baby
now the pills are wornout and silly, like classical gods
their poppysleepy colors do him no good
his head is a little interior of gray mirrors
each gesture flees immediately down an alley
of diminishing perspectives, and its significance
drains like water out the hole at the far end
he lives without privacy in a lidless room,
the bald slots of his eyes stiffened wideopen
on the incessant heatlightning flicker of situations
nightlong, in the granite yard, invisible cats
have been howling like women, or damaged instruments
already he can feel daylight, his white disease,
creeping up with her hatful of trivial repetitions
the city is a map of cheerful twitters now,
and everywhere people, eyes micasilver and blank,
are riding to work in rows, as if recently brainwashed

widow
widow the word consumes itself
body, a sheet of newsprint on the fire
levitating a numb minute in the updraft
over the scalding, red topography
that will put her heart out like an only eye
widow the dead syllable, with its shadow
of an echo, exposes the panel in the wall
behind which the secret passage liesstale air,
fusty remembrances, the coiledspring stair
that opens at the top onto nothing at all
widow the bitter spider sits
and sits in the center of her loveless spokes
death is the dress she wears, her hat and collar
the mothface of her husband, moon white and ill,
circles her like a prey shed love to kill
a second time, to have him near again
a paper image to lay against her heart
the way she laid his letters, till they grew warm
and seemed to give her warmth, like a live skin
but it is she who is paper now, warmed by no one
widow that great, vacant estate
the voice of god is full of draftiness,
promising simply the hard stars, the space
of immortal blankness between stars
and no bodies, singing like arrows up to heaven
widow, the compassionate trees bend in,
the trees of loneliness, the trees of mourning
they stand like shadows about the green landscape
or even like black holes cut out of it
a widow resembles them, a shadowthing,
hand folding hand, and nothing in between
a bodiless soul could pass another soul
in this clear air and never notice it
igbi
one soul pass through the other, frail as smoke
and utterly ignorant of the way it took
that is the fear she hasthe fear
his soul may beat and be beating at her dull sense
like blue marys angel, dovelike against a pane
blinded to all but the gray, spiritless room
it looks in on, and must go on looking in on

stars over the dordogne
stars are dropping thick as stones into the twiggy
picket of trees whose silhouette is darker
than the dark of the sky because it is quite starless
the woods are a well the stars drop silently
they seem large, yet they drop, and no gap is visible
nor do they send up fires where they fall
or any signal of distress or anxiousness
they are eaten immediately by the pines
where i am at home, only the sparsest stars
arrive at twilight, and then after some effort
and they are wan, dulled by much travelling
the smaller and more timid never arrive at all
but stay, sitting far out, in their own dust
they are orphans i cannot see them they are lost
but tonight they have discovered this river with no trouble,
they are scrubbed and selfassured as the great planets
the big dipper is my only familiar
i miss orion and cassiopeias chair maybe they are
hanging shyly under the studded horizon
like a childs toosimple mathematical problem
infinite number seems to be the issue up there
or else they are present, and their disguise so bright
i am overlooking them by looking too hard
perhaps it is the season that is not right

igiigi
and what if the sky here is no different,
and it is my eyes that have been sharpening themselves ?
such a luxury of stars would embarrass me
the few i am used to are plain and durable
i think they would not wish for this dressy backcloth
or much company, or the mildness of the south
they are too puritan and solitary for that
when one of them falls it leaves a space,
a sense of absence in its old shining place
and where i lie now, back to my own dark star,
i see those constellations in my head,
unwarmed by the sweet air of this peach orchard
there is too much ease here these stars treat me too well
on this hill, with its view of lit castles, each swung bell
is accounting for its cow i shut my eyes
and drink the small night chill like news of home
the rival
if the moon smiled, she would resemble you
you leave the same impression
of something beautiful, but annihilating
both of you are great light borrowers
her omouth grieves at the world yours is unaffected,
and your first gift is making stone out of everything
i wake to a mausoleum you are here,
ticking your fingers on the marble table, looking for cigarettes,
spiteful as a woman, but not so nervous,
and dying to say something unanswerable
the moon, too, abases her subjects,
but in the daytime she is ridiculous
your dissatisfactions, on the other hand,
arrive through the mailslot with loving regularity,
white and blank, expansive as carbon monoxide
igi
no day is safe from news of you,
walking about in africa maybe, but thinking of me

wuthering heights
the horizons ring me like faggots,
tilted and disparate, and always unstable
touched by a match, they might warm me,
and their fine lines singe
the air to orange
before the distances they pin evaporate,
weighting the pale sky with a solider color
but they only dissolve and dissolve
like a series of promises, as i step forward
there is no life higher than the grasstops
or the hearts of sheep, and the wind
pours by like destiny, bending
everything in one direction
i can feel it trying
to funnel my heat away
if i pay the roots of the heather
too close attention, they will invite me
to whiten my bones among them
the sheep know where they are,
browsing in their dirty woolclouds,
gray as the weather
the black slots of their pupils take me in
it is like being mailed into space,
a thin, silly message
they stand about in grandmotherly disguise,
all wig curls and yellow teeth
and hard, marbly baas
i come to wheel ruts, and water
limpid as the solitudes

igiiqi
that flee through my fingers
hollow doorsteps go from grass to grass
lintel and sill have unhinged themselves
of people the air only
remembers a few odd syllables
it rehearses them moaningly
black stone, black stone
the sky leans on me, me, the one upright
among all horizontals
the grass is beating its head distractedly
it is too delicate
for a life in such company
darkness terrifies it
now, in valleys narrow
and black as purses, the house lights
gleam like small change

blackberrying
nobody in the lane, and nothing, nothing but blackberries,
blackberries on either side, though on the right mainly,
a blackberry alley, going down in hooks, and a sea
somewhere at the end of it, heaving blackberries
big as the ball of my thumb, and dumb as eyes
ebon in the hedges, fat
with bluered juices these they squander on my fingers
i had not asked for such a blood sisterhood they must love me
they accommodate themselves to my milkbottle, flattening their sides
overhead go the choughs in black, cacophonous flocks
bits of burnt paper wheeling in a blown sky
theirs is the only voice, protesting, protesting
i do not think the sea will appear at all
the high, green meadows are glowing, as if lit from within
i come to one bush of berries so ripe it is a bush of flies,
hanging their bluegreen bellies and their wing panes in a chinese screen
iqi
the honeyfeast of the berries has stunned them they believe in heaven
one more hook, and the berries and bushes end
the only thing to come now is the sea
from between two hills a sudden wind funnels at me,
slapping its phantom laundry in my face
these hills are too green and sweet to have tasted salt
i follow the sheep path between them a last hook brings me
to the hills northern face, and the face is orange rock
that looks out on nothing, nothing but a great space
of white and pewter lights, and a din like silversmiths
beating and beating at an intractable metal

finisterre
this was the lands end the last fingers, knuckled and rheumatic,
cramped on nothing black
admonitory cliffs, and the sea exploding
with no bottom, or anything on the other side of it,
whitened by the faces of the drowned
now it is only gloomy, a dump of rocks
leftover soldiers from old, messy wars
the sea cannons into their ear, but they dont budge
other rocks hide their grudges under the water
the cliffs are edged with trefoils, stars and bells
such as fingers might embroider, close to death,
almost too small for the mists to bother with
the mists are part of the ancient paraphernalia
souls, rolled in the doomnoise of the sea
they bruise the rocks out of existence, then resurrect them
they go up without hope, like sighs
i walk among them, and they stuff my mouth with cotton
when they free me, i am beaded with tears
our lady of the shipwrecked is striding toward the horizon,
her marble skirts blown back in two pink wings
iqi
a marble sailor kneels at her foot distractedly, and at his foot
a peasant woman in black
is praying to the monument of the sailor praying
our lady of the shipwrecked is three times life size,
her lips sweet with divinity
she does not hear what the sailor or the peasant is saying
she is in love with the beautiful formlessness of the sea
gullcolored laces flap in the sea drafts
beside the postcard stalls
the peasants anchor them with conches one is told
these are the pretty trinkets the sea hides,
little shells made up into necklaces and toy ladies
they do not come from the bay of the dead down there,
but from another place, tropical and blue,
we have never been to
these are our crepes eat them before they blow cold

the surgeon at  am
the white light is artificial, and hygienic as heaven
the microbes cannot survive it
they are departing in their transparent garments, turned aside
from the scalpels and the rubber hands
the scalded sheet is a snowfield, frozen and peaceful
the body under it is in my hands
as usual there is no face a lump of chinese white
with seven holes thumbed in the soul is another light
i have not seen it it does not fly up
tonight it has receded like a ships light
it is a garden i have to do withtubers and fruits
oozing their jammy substances,
a mat of roots my assistants hook them back
stenches and colors assail me
this is the lungtree
these orchids are splendid they spot and coil like snakes
igi
the heart is a redbellbloom, in distress
i am so small
in comparison to these organs
i worm and hack in a purple wilderness
the blood is a sunset i admire it
i am up to my elbows in it, red and squeaking
still it seeps up, it is not exhausted
so magical a hot spring
i must seal off and let fill
the intricate, blue piping under this pale marble
how i admire the romans
aqueducts, the baths of caracalla, the eagle nose
the body is a roman thing
it has shut its mouth on the stone pill of repose
it is a statue the orderlies are wheeling off
i have perfected it
i am left with an arm or a leg,
a set of teeth, or stones
to rattle in a bottle and take home,
and tissue in slicesa pathological salami
tonight the parts are entombed in an icebox
tomorrow they will swim
in vinegar like saints relics
tomorrow the patient will have a clean, pink plastic limb
over one bed in the ward, a small blue light
announces a new soul the bed is blue
tonight, for this person, blue is a beautiful color
the angels of morphia have borne him up
he floats an inch from the ceiling,
smelling the dawn drafts
i walk among sleepers in gauze sarcophagi
the red night lights are flat moons they are dull with blood
i am the sun, in my white coat,
gray faces, shuttered by drugs, follow me like flowers

last words
i do not want a plain box, i want a sarcophagus
with tigery stripes, and a face on it
round as the moon, to stare up
i want to be looking at them when they come
picking among the dumb minerals, the roots
i see them alreadythe pale, stardistance faces
now they are nothing, they are not even babies
i imagine them without fathers or mothers, like the first gods
they will wonder if i was important
i should sugar and preserve my days like fruit
my mirror is clouding over
a few more breaths, and it will reflect nothing at all
the flowers and the faces whiten to a sheet
i do not trust the spirit it escapes like steam
in dreams, through mouthhole or eyehole i cant stop it
one day it wont come back things arent like that
they stay, their little particular lusters
warmed by much handling they almost purr
when the soles of my feet grow cold,
the blue eye of my turquoise will comfort me
let me have my copper cooking pots, let my rouge pots
bloom about me like night flowers, with a good smell
they will roll me up in bandages, they will store my heart
under my feet in a neat parcel
i shall hardly know myself it will be dark,
and the shine of these small things sweeter than the face of ishtar

the moon and the yew tree
this is the light of the mind, cold and planetary
the trees of the mind are black the light is blue
the grasses unload their griefs on my feet as if i were god,
prickling my ankles and murmuring of their humility
fumy, spiritous mists inhabit this place
igi
separated from my house by a row of headstones
i simply cannot see where there is to get to
the moon is no door it is a face in its own right,
white as a knuckle and terribly upset
it drags the sea after it like a dark crime it is quiet
with the ogape of complete despair i live here
twice on sunday, the bells startle the sky
eight great tongues affirming the resurrection
at the end, they soberly bong out their names
the yew tree points up it has a gothic shape
the eyes lift after it and find the moon
the moon is my mother she is not sweet like mary
her blue garments unloose small bats and owls
how i would like to believe in tenderness
the face of the effigy, gentled by candles,
bending, on me in particular, its mild eyes
i have fallen a long way clouds are flowering
blue and mystical over the face of the stars
inside the church, the saints will be all blue,
floating on their delicate feet over the cold pews,
their hands and faces stiff with holiness
the moon sees nothing of this she is bald and wild
and the message of the yew tree is blacknessblackness and silence

mirror
i am silver and exact i have no preconceptions
whatever i see i swallow immediately
just as it is, unmisted by love or dislike
i am not cruel, only truthful
the eye of a little god, fourcornered
most of the time i meditate on the opposite wall
it is pink, with speckles i have looked at it so long
i think it is a part of my heart but it flickers
faces and darkness separate us over and over
igi
now i am a lake a woman bends over me,
searching my reaches for what she really is
then she turns to those liars, the candles or the moon
i see her back, and reflect it faithfully
she rewards me with tears and an agitation of hands
i am important to her she comes and goes
each morning it is her face that replaces the darkness
in me she has drowned a young girl, and in me an old woman
rises toward her day after day, like a terrible fish

the babysitters
it is ten years, now, since we rowed to childrens island
the sun flamed straight down that noon on the water off marblehead
that summer we wore black glasses to hide our eyes
we were always crying, in our spare rooms, little putupon sisters,
in the two huge, white, handsome houses in swampscott
when the sweetheart from england appeared, with her cream skin and
yardley cosmetics,
i had to sleep in the same room with the baby on a tooshort cot,
and the sevenyearold wouldnt go out unless his jersey stripes
matched the stripes of his socks
o it was richnesseleven rooms and a yacht
with a polished mahogany stair to let into the water
and a cabin boy who could decorate cakes in sixcolored frosting
but i didnt know how to cook, and babies depressed me
nights, i wrote in my diary spitefully, my fingers red
with triangular scorch marks from ironing tiny ruchings and puffed
sleeves
when the sporty wife and her doctor husband went on one of their
cruises
they left me a borrowed maid named ellen, for protection,
and a small dalmatian
in your house, the main house, you were better off
you had a rose garden and a guest cottage and a model apothecary shop
igi
and a cook and a maid, and knew about the key to the bourbon
i remember you playing ja da in a pink pique dress
on the gameroom piano, when the big people were out,
and the maid smoked and shot pool under a greenshaded lamp
the cook had one wall eye and couldnt sleep, she was so nervous
on trial, from ireland, she burned batch after batch of cookies
till she was fired
what has come over us, my sister
on that dayoff the two of us cried so hard to get
we lifted a sugared ham and a pineapple from the grownups icebox
and rented an old green boat i rowed you read
aloud, crosslegged on the stern seat, from the generation of vipers
so we bobbed out to the island it was deserted
a gallery of creaking porches and still interiors,
stopped and awful as a photograph of somebody laughing,
but ten years dead
the bold gulls dove as if they owned it all
we picked up sticks of driftwood and beat them off,
then stepped down the steep beach shelf and into the water
we kicked and talked the thick salt kept us up
see us floating there yet, inseparabletwo cork dolls
what keyhole have we slipped through, what door has shut ?
the shadows of the grasses inched round like hands of a clock,
and from our opposite continents we wave and call
everything has happened

is
new year on dartmoor
this is newness every little tawdry
obstacle glasswrapped and peculiar,
glinting and clinking in a saints falsetto only you
dont know what to make of the sudden slippiness,
the blind, white, awful, inaccessible slant
theres no getting up it by the words you know
no getting up by elephant or wheel or shoe
we have only come to look you are too new
to want the world in a glass hat

three women
a poem for three voices
setting a maternity ward and round about
first voice
i am slow as the world i am very patient,
turning through my time, the suns and stars
regarding me with attention
the moons concern is more personal
she passes and repasses, luminous as a nurse
is she sorry for what will happen ? i do not think so
she is simply astonished at fertility
when i walk out, i am a great event
i do not have to think, or even rehearse
what happens in me will happen without attention
the pheasant stands on the hill
he is arranging his brown feathers
ig
i cannot help smiling at what it is i know
leaves and petals attend me i am ready
second voice
when i first saw it, the small red seep, i did not believe it
i watched the men walk about me in the office they were so flat
there was something about them like cardboard, and now i had caught it,
that flat, flat, flatness from which ideas, destructions,
bulldozers, guillotines, white chambers of shrieks proceed,
endlessly proceedand the cold angels, the abstractions
i sat at my desk in my stockings, my high heels,
and the man i work for laughed have you seen something awful ?
you are so white, suddenly and i said nothing
i saw death in the bare trees, a deprivation
i could not believe it is it so difficult
for the spirit to conceive a face, a mouth ?
the letters proceed from these black keys, and these black keys proceed
from my alphabetical fingers, ordering parts,
parts, bits, cogs, the shining multiples
i am dying as i sit i lose a dimension
trains roar in my ears, departures, departures
the silver track of time empties into the distance,
the white sky empties of its promise, like a cup
these are my feet, these mechanical echoes
tap, tap, tap, steel pegs i am found wanting
this is a disease i carry home, this is a death
again, this is a death is it the air,
the particles of destruction i suck up ? am i a pulse
that wanes and wanes, facing the cold angel ?
is this my lover then ? this death, this death ?
as a child i loved a lichenbitten name
is this the one sin then, this old dead love of death ?
third voice
i remember the minute when i knew for sure
the willows were chilling,
the face in the pool was beautiful, but not mine
it had a consequential look, like everything else,
ig
and all i could see was dangers doves and words,
stars and showers of goldconceptions, conceptions
i remember a white, cold wing
and the great swan, with its terrible look,
coming at me, like a castle, from the top of the river
there is a snake in swans
he glided by his eye had a black meaning
i saw the world in itsmall, mean and black,
every little word hooked to every little word, and act to act
a hot blue day had budded into something
i wasnt ready the white clouds rearing
aside were dragging me in four directions
i wasnt ready
i had no reverence
i thought i could deny the consequence
but it was too late for that it was too late, and the face
went on shaping itself with love, as if i was ready
second voice
it is a world of snow now i am not at home
how white these sheets are the faces have no features
they are bald and impossible, like the faces of my children,
those little sick ones that elude my arms
other children do not touch me they are terrible
they have too many colors, too much life they are not quiet,
quiet, like the little emptinesses i carry
i have had my chances i have tried and tried
i have stitched life into me like a rare organ,
and walked carefully, precariously, like something rare
i have tried not to think too hard i have tried to be natural
i have tried to be blind in love, like other women,
blind in my bed, with my dear blind sweet one,
not looking, through the thick dark, for the face of another
i did not look but still the face was there,
the face of the unborn one that loved its perfections,
the face of the dead one that could only be perfect
in its easy peace, could only keep holy so
ig
and then there were other faces the faces of nations,
governments, parliaments, societies,
the faceless faces of important men
it is these men i mind
they are so jealous of anything that is not flat they are jealous gods
that would have the whole world flat because they are
i see the father conversing with the son
such flatness cannot but be holy
let us make a heaven, they say
let us flatten and launder the grossness from these souls
first voice
i am calm i am calm it is the calm before something awful
the yellow minute before the wind walks, when the leaves
turn up their hands, their pallors it is so quiet here
the sheets, the faces, are white and stopped, like clocks
voices stand back and flatten their visible hieroglyphs
flatten to parchment screens to keep the wind off
they paint such secrets in arabic, chinese
i am dumb and brown i am a seed about to break
the brownness is my dead self, and it is sullen
it does not wish to be more, or different
dusk hoods me in blue now, like a mary
color of distance and forgetfulness
when will it be, the second when time breaks
and eternity engulfs it, and i drown utterly ?
talk to myself, myself only, set apart
swabbed and lurid with disinfectants, sacrificial
waiting lies heavy on my lids it lies like sleep,
like a big sea far off, far off, i feel the first wave tug
its cargo of agony toward me, inescapable, tidal
and i, a shell, echoing on this white beach
face the voices that overwhelm, the terrible element
third voice
i am a mountain now, among mountainy women
the doctors move among us as if our bigness
frightened the mind they smile like fools
ig
they are to blame for what i am, and they know it
they hug their flatness like a kind of health
and what if they found themselves surprised, as i did ?
they would go mad with it
and what if two lives leaked between my thighs ?
i have seen the white clean chamber with its instruments
it is a place of shrieks it is not happy
this is where you will come when you are ready
the night lights are flat red moons they are dull with blood
i am not ready for anything to happen
i should have murdered this, that murders me
first voice
there is no miracle more cruel than this
i am dragged by the horses, the iron hooves
i last i last it out i accomplish a work
dark tunnel, through which hurtle the visitations,
the visitations, the manifestations, the startled faces
i am the center of an atrocity
what pains, what sorrows must i be mothering ?
can such innocence kill and kill ? it milks my life
the trees wither in the street the rain is corrosive
i taste it on my tongue, and the workable horrors,
the horrors that stand and idle, the slighted godmothers
with their hearts that tick and tick, with their satchels of instruments
i shall be a wall and a roof, protecting
i shall be a sky and a hill of good o let me be
a power is growing on me, an old tenacity
i am breaking apart like the world there is this blackness,
this ram of blackness i fold my hands on a mountain
the air is thick it is thick with this working
i am used i am drummed into use
my eyes are squeezed by this blackness
i see nothing
second voice
i am accused i dream of massacres
i am a garden of black and red agonies i drink them,
ig
hating myself, hating and fearing and now the world conceives
its end and runs toward it, arms held out in love
it is a love of death that sickens everything
a dead sun stains the newsprint it is red
i lose life after life the dark earth drinks them
she is the vampire of us all so she supports us,
fattens us, is kind her mouth is red
i know her i know her intimately
old winterface, old barren one, old time bomb
men have used her meanly she will eat them
eat them, eat them, eat them in the end
the sun is down i die i make a death
first voice
who is he, this blue, furious boy,
shiny and strange, as if he had hurtled from a star?
he is looking so angrily
he flew into the room, a shriek at his heel
the blue color pales he is human after all
a red lotus opens in its bowl of blood
they are stitching me up with silk, as if i were a material
what did my fingers do before they held him ?
what did my heart do, with its love ?
i have never seen a thing so clear
his lids are like the lilacflower
and soft as a moth, his breath
i shall not let go
there is no guile or warp in him may he keep so
second voice
there is the moon in the high window it is over
how winter fills my soul and that chalk light
laying its scales on the windows, the windows of empty offices,
empty schoolrooms, empty churches o so much emptiness
there is this cessation this terrible cessation of everything
these bodies mounded around me now, these polar sleepers
what blue, moony ray ices their dreams ?
ig
i feel it enter me, cold, alien, like an instrument
and that mad, hard face at the end of it, that omouth
open in its gape of perpetual grieving
it is she that drags the bloodblack sea around
month after month, with its voices of failure
i am helpless as the sea at the end of her string
i am restless restless and useless i, too, create corpses
i shall move north i shall move into a long blackness
i see myself as a shadow, neither man nor woman,
neither a woman, happy to be like a man, nor a man
blunt and flat enough to feel no lack i feel a lack
i hold my fingers up, ten white pickets
see, the darkness is leaking from the cracks
i cannot contain it i cannot contain my life
i shall be a heroine of the peripheral
i shall not be accused by isolate buttons,
holes in the heels of socks, the white mute faces
of unanswered letters, coffined in a letter case
i shall not be accused, i shall not be accused
the clock shall not find me wanting, nor these stars
that rivet in place abyss after abyss
third voice
i see her in my sleep, my red, terrible girl
she is crying through the glass that separates us
she is crying, and she is furious
her cries are hooks that catch and grate like cats
it is by these hooks she climbs to my notice
she is crying at the dark, or at the stars
that at such a distance from us shine and whirl
i think her little head is carved in wood,
a red, hard wood, eyes shut and mouth wide open
and from the open mouth issue sharp cries
scratching at my sleep like arrows,
scratching at my sleep, and entering my side
my daughter has no teeth her mouth is wide
it utters such dark sounds it cannot be good

first voice
what is it that flings these innocent souls at us ?
look, they are so exhausted, they are all flat out
in their canvassided cots, names tied to their wrists,
the little silver trophies theyve come so far for
there are some with thick black hair, there are some bald
their skin tints are pink or sallow, brown or red
they are beginning to remember their differences
i think they are made of water they have no expression
their features are sleeping, like light on quiet water
they are the real monks and nuns in their identical garments
i see them showering like stars on to the world
on india, africa, america, these miraculous ones,
these pure, small images they smell of milk
their footsoles are untouched they are walkers of air
can nothingness be so prodigal ?
here is my son
his wide eye is that general, flat blue
he is turning to me like a little, blind, bright plant
one cry it is the hook i hang on
and i am a river of milk
i am a warm hill
second voice
i am not ugly i am even beautiful
the mirror gives back a woman without deformity
the nurses give back my clothes, and an identity
it is usual, they say, for such a thing to happen
it is usual in my life, and the lives of others
i am one in five, something like that i am not hopeless
i am beautiful as a statistic here is my lipstick
i draw on the old mouth
the red mouth i put by with my identity
a day ago, two days, three days ago it was a friday
i do not even need a holiday i can go to work today
i can love my husband, who will understand
who will love me through the blur of my deformity
as if i had lost an eye, a leg, a tongue
ig
and so i stand, a little sightless so i walk
away on wheels, instead of legs, they serve as well
and learn to speak with fingers, not a tongue
the body is resourceful
the body of a starfish can grow back its arms
and newts are prodigal in legs and may i be
as prodigal in what lacks me
third voice
she is a small island, asleep and peaceful,
and i am a white ship hooting goodbye, goodbye
the day is blazing it is very mournful
the flowers in this room are red and tropical
they have lived behind glass all their lives, they have been cared for
tenderly
now they face a winter of white sheets, white faces
there is very little to go into my suitcase
there are the clothes of a fat woman i do not know
there is my comb and brush there is an emptiness
i am so vulnerable suddenly
i am a wound walking out of hospital
i am a wound that they are letting go
i leave my health behind i leave someone
who would adhere to me i undo her fingers like bandages i go
second voice
i am myself again there are no loose ends
i am bled white as wax, i have no attachments
i am flat and virginal, which means nothing has happened,
nothing that cannot be erased, ripped up and scrapped, begun again
these little black twigs do not think to bud,
nor do these dry, dry gutters dream of rain
this woman who meets me in windowsshe is neat
so neat she is transparent, like a spirit
how shyly she superimposes her neat self
on the inferno of african oranges, the heelhung pigs
she is deferring to reality
it is i it is i
tasting the bitterness between my teeth
the incalculable malice of the everyday
iq
first voice
how long can i be a wall, keeping the wind off?
how long can i be
gentling the sun with the shade of my hand,
intercepting the blue bolts of a cold moon?
the voices of loneliness, the voices of sorrow
lap at my back ineluctably
how shall it soften them, this little lullaby ?
how long can i be a wall around my green property ?
how long can my hands
be a bandage to his hurt, and my words
bright birds in the sky, consoling, consoling ?
it is a terrible thing
to be so open it is as if my heart
put on a face and walked into the world
third voice
today the colleges are drunk with spring
my black gown is a little funeral
it shows i am serious
the books i carry wedge into my side
i had an old wound once, but it is healing
i had a dream of an island, red with cries
it was a dream, and did not mean a thing
first voice
dawn flowers in the great elm outside the house
the swifts are back they are shrieking like paper rockets
i hear the sound of the hours
widen and die in the hedgerows i hear the moo of cows
the colors replenish themselves, and the wet
thatch smokes in the sun
the narcissi open white faces in the orchard
i am reassured i am reassured
these are the clear bright colors of the nursery,
the talking ducks, the happy lambs
i am simple again i believe in miracles
i do not believe in those terrible children
who injure my sleep with their white eyes, their fingerless hands
they are not mine they do not belong to me
iq
i shall meditate upon normality
i shall meditate upon my little son
he does not walk he does not speak a word
he is still swaddled in white bands
but he is pink and perfect he smiles so frequently
i have papered his room with big roses,
i have painted little hearts on everything
i do not will him to be exceptional
it is the exception that interests the devil
it is the exception that climbs the sorrowful hill
or sits in the desert and hurts his mothers heart
i will him to be common,
to love me as i love him,
and to marry what he wants and where he will
third voice
hot noon in the meadows the buttercups
swelter and melt, and the lovers
pass by, pass by
they are black and flat as shadows
it is so beautiful to have no attachments
i am solitary as grass what is it i miss?
shall i ever find it, whatever it is ?
the swans are gone still the river
remembers how white they were
it strives after them with its lights
it finds their shapes in a cloud
what is that bird that cries
with such sorrow in its voice ?
i am young as ever, it says what is it i miss?
second voice
i am at home in the lamplight the evenings are lengthening
i am mending a silk slip my husband is reading
how beautifully the light includes these things
there is a kind of smoke in the spring air,
a smoke that takes the parks, the little statues
with pinkness, as if a tenderness awoke,
a tenderness that did not tire, something healing
iq
i wait and ache i think i have been healing
there is a great deal else to do my hands
can stitch lace neatly on to this material my husband
can turn and turn the pages of a book
and so we are at home together, after hours
it is only time that weighs upon our hands
it is only time, and that is not material
the streets may turn to paper suddenly, but i recover
from the long fall, and find myself in bed,
safe on the mattress, hands braced, as for a fall
i find myself again i am no shadow
though there is a shadow starting from my feet i am a wife
the city waits and aches the little grasses
crack through stone, and they are green with life
march ig

little fugue
the yews black fingers wag
cold clouds go over
so the deaf and dumb
signal the blind, and are ignored
i like black statements
the featurelessness of that cloud, now
white as an eye all over
the eye of the blind pianist
at my table on the ship
he felt for his food
his fingers had the noses of weasels
i couldnt stop looking
he could hear beethoven
black yew, white cloud,
the horrific complications
fingertrapsa tumult of keys
ig
empty and silly as plates,
so the blind smile
i envy the big noises,
the yew hedge of the grosse fuge
deafness is something else
such a dark funnel, my father
i see your voice
black and leafy, as in my childhood,
a yew hedge of orders,
gothic and barbarous, pure german
dead men cry from it
i am guilty of nothing
the yew my christ, then
is it not as tortured ?
and you, during the great war
in the california delicatessen
lopping the sausages
they color my sleep,
red, mottled, like cut necks
there was a silence
great silence of another order
i was seven, i knew nothing
the world occurred
you had one leg, and a prussian mind
now similar clouds
are spreading their vacuous sheets
do you say nothing ?
i am lame in the memory
i remember a blue eye,
a briefcase of tangerines
this was a man, then
death opened, like a black tree, blackly
ig
i survive the while,
arranging my morning
these are my fingers, this my baby
the clouds are a marriage dress, of that pallor
april ig
an appearance
the smile of iceboxes annihilates me
such blue currents in the veins of my loved one
i hear her great heart purr
from her lips ampersands and percent signs
exit like kisses
it is monday in her mind morals
launder and present themselves
what am i to make of these contradictions ?
i wear white cuffs, i bow
is this love then, this red material
issuing from the steel needle that flies so blindingly ?
it will make little dresses and coats,
it will cover a dynasty
how her body opens and shuts
a swiss watch, jeweled in the hinges
o heart, such disorganization
the stars are flashing like terrible numerals
abc, her eyelids say
april ig
iq
crossing the water
black lake, black boat, two black, cutpaper people
where do the black trees go that drink here ?
their shadows must cover canada
a little light is filtering from the water flowers
their leaves do not wish us to hurry
they are round and flat and full of dark advice
cold worlds shake from the oar
the spirit of blackness is in us, it is in the fishes
a snag is lifting a valedictory, pale hand
stars open among the lilies
are you not blinded by such expressionless sirens ?
this is the silence of astounded souls
april ig
among the narcissi
spry, wry, and gray as these march sticks,
percy bows, in his blue peajacket, among the narcissi
he is recuperating from something on the lung
the narcissi, too, are bowing to some big thing
it rattles their stars on the green hill where percy
nurses the hardship of his stitches, and walks and walks
there is a dignity to this there is a formality
the flowers vivid as bandages, and the man mending
they bow and stand they suffer such attacks
and the octogenarian loves the little flocks
he is quite blue the terrible wind tries his breathing
the narcissi look up like children, quickly and whitely

pheasant
you said you would kill it this morning
do not kill it it startles me still,
the jut of that odd, dark head, pacing
through the uncut grass on the elms hill
it is something to own a pheasant,
or just to be visited at all
i am not mystical it isnt
as if i thought it had a spirit
it is simply in its element
that gives it a kingliness, a right
the print of its big foot last winter,
the tailtrack, on the snow in our court
the wonder of it, in that pallor,
through crosshatch of sparrow and starling
is it its rareness, then ? it is rare
but a dozen would be worth having,
a hundred, on that hillgreen and red,
crossing and recrossing a fine thing
it is such a good shape, so vivid
its a little cornucopia
it unclaps, brown as a leaf, and loud,
settles in the elm, and is easy
it was sunning in the narcissi
i trespass stupidly let be, let be

elm
for ruth fainlight
i know the bottom, she says i know it with my great tap root
it is what you fear
i do not fear it i have been there
is it the sea you hear in me,
its dissatisfactions ?
or the voice of nothing, that was your madness?
love is a shadow
how you lie and cry after it
listen these are its hooves it has gone off, like a horse
all night i shall gallop thus, impetuously,
till your head is a stone, your pillow a little turf,
echoing, echoing
or shall i bring you the sound of poisons ?
this is rain now, this big hush
and this is the fruit of it tinwhite, like arsenic
i have suffered the atrocity of sunsets
scorched to the root
my red filaments burn and stand, a hand of wires
now i break up in pieces that fly about like clubs
a wind of such violence
will tolerate no bystanding i must shriek
the moon, also, is merciless she would drag me
cruelly, being barren
her radiance scathes me or perhaps i have caught her
i let her go i let her go
diminished and flat, as after radical surgery
how your bad dreams possess and endow me
ig
i am inhabited by a cry
nightly it flaps out
looking, with its hooks, for something to love
i am terrified by this dark thing
that sleeps in me
all day i feel its soft, feathery turnings, its malignity
clouds pass and disperse
are those the faces of love, those pale irretrievables ?
is it for such i agitate my heart ?
i am incapable of more knowledge
what is this, this face
so murderous in its strangle of branches ?
its snaky acids kiss
it petrifies the will these are the isolate, slow faults
that kill, that kill, that kill
ig april ig
the rabbit catcher
it was a place of force
the wind gagging my mouth with my own blown hair,
tearing off my voice, and the sea
blinding me with its lights, the lives of the dead
unreeling in it, spreading like oil
i tasted the malignity of the gorse,
its black spikes,
the extreme unction of its yellow candleflowers
they had an efficiency, a great beauty,
and were extravagant, like torture
there was only one place to get to
simmering, perfumed,
the paths narrowed into the hollow
ig
and the snares almost effaced themselves
zeros, shutting on nothing,
set close, like birth pangs
the absence of shrieks
made a hole in the hot day, a vacancy
the glassy light was a clear wall,
the thickets quiet
i felt a still busyness, an intent
i felt hands round a tea mug, dull, blunt,
ringing the white china
how they awaited him, those little deaths
they waited like sweethearts they excited him
and we, too, had a relationship
tight wires between us,
pegs too deep to uproot, and a mind like a ring
sliding shut on some quick thing,
the constriction killing me also
may ig

event
how the elements solidify
the moonlight, that chalk cliff
in whose rift we lie
back to back i hear an owl cry
from its cold indigo
intolerable vowels enter my heart
the child in the white crib revolves and sighs,
opens its mouth now, demanding
his little face is carved in pained, red wood
then there are the starsineradicable, hard
one touch it burns and sickens
i cannot see your eyes
iq
where apple bloom ices the night
i walk in a ring,
a groove of old faults, deep and bitter
love cannot come here
a black gap discloses itself
on the opposite lip
a small white soul is waving, a small white maggot
my limbs, also, have left me
who has dismembered us ?
the dark is melting we touch like cripples
may ig

apprehensions
there is this white wall, above which the sky creates itself
infinite, green, utterly untouchable
angels swim in it, and the stars, in indifference also
they are my medium
the sun dissolves on this wall, bleeding its lights
a gray wall now, clawed and bloody
is there no way out of the mind ?
steps at my back spiral into a well
there are no trees or birds in this world,
there is only a sourness
this red wall winces continually
a red fist, opening and closing,
two gray, papery bags
this is what i am made of, this and a terror
of being wheeled off under crosses and a rain of pietas
on a black wall, unidentifiable birds
swivel their heads and cry
ig
there is no talk of immortality among these
cold blanks approach us
they move in a hurry

berckplage

this is the sea, then, this great abeyance
how the suns poultice draws on my inflammation
electrifyinglycolored sherbets, scooped from the freeze
by pale girls, travel the air in scorched hands
why is it so quiet, what are they hiding ?
i have two legs, and i move smilingly
a sandy damper kills the vibrations
it stretches for miles, the shrunk voices
waving and crutchless, half their old size
the lines of the eye, scalded by these bald surfaces,
boomerang like anchored elastics, hurting the owner
is it any wonder he puts on dark glasses ?
is it any wonder he affects a black cassock ?
here he comes now, among the mackerel gatherers
who wall up their backs against him
they are handling the black and green lozenges like the parts of a body
the sea, that crystallized these,
creeps away, manysnaked, with a long hiss of distress
ig

this black boot has no mercy for anybody
why should it, it is the hearse of a dead foot,
the high, dead, toeless foot of this priest
who plumbs the well of his book,
the bent print bulging before him like scenery
obscene bikinis hide in the dunes,
breasts and hips a confectioners sugar
of little crystals, titillating the light,
while a green pool opens its eye,
sick with what it has swallowed
limbs, images, shrieks behind the concrete bunkers
two lovers unstick themselves
o white seacrockery,
what cupped sighs, what salt in the throat
and the onlooker, trembling,
drawn like a long material
through a still virulence,
and a weed, hairy as privates

on the balconies of the hotel, things are glittering
things, things
tubular steel wheelchairs, aluminum crutches
such saltsweetness why should i walk
beyond the breakwater, spotty with barnacles ?
i am not a nurse, white and attendant,
ig
i am not a smile
these children are after something, with hooks and cries,
and my heart too small to bandage their terrible faults
this is the side of a man his red ribs,
the nerves bursting like trees, and this is the surgeon
one mirrory eye
a facet of knowledge
on a striped mattress in one room
an old man is vanishing
there is no help in his weeping wife
where are the eyestones, yellow and valuable,
and the tongue, sapphire of ash

a weddingcake face in a paper frill
how superior he is now
it is like possessing a saint
the nurses in their wingcaps are no longer so beautiful
they are browning, like touched gardenias
the bed is rolled from the wall
this is what it is to be complete it is horrible
is he wearing pajamas or an evening suit
under the glued sheet from which his powdery beak
rises so whitely unbuffeted ?
they propped his jaw with a book until it stiffened
and folded his hands, that were shaking goodbye, goodbye
now the washed sheets fly in the sun,
the pillow cases are sweetening
ig
it is a blessing, it is a blessing
the long coffin of soapcolored oak,
the curious bearers and the raw date
engraving itself in silver with marvelous calm

the gray sky lowers, the hills like a green sea
run fold upon fold far off, concealing their hollows,
the hollows in which rock the thoughts of the wife
blunt, practical boats
full of dresses and hats and china and married daughters
in the parlor of the stone house
one curtain is flickering from the open window,
flickering and pouring, a pitiful candle
this is the tongue of the dead man remember, remember
how far he is now, his actions
around him like livingroom furniture, like a decor
as the pallors gather
the pallors of hands and neighborly faces,
the elate pallors of flying iris
they are flying off into nothing remember us
the empty benches of memory look over stones,
marble facades with blue veins, and jellyglassfuls of daffodils
it is so beautiful up here it is a stopping place

the natural fatness of these lime leaves
pollarded green balls, the trees march to church
iq
the voice of the priest, in thin air,
meets the corpse at the gate,
addressing it, while the hills roll the notes of the dead bell
a glitter of wheat and crude earth
what is the name of that color ?
old blood of caked walls the sun heals,
old blood of limb stumps, burnt hearts
the widow with her black pocketbook and three daughters,
necessary among the flowers,
enfolds her face like fine linen,
not to be spread again
while a sky, wormy with putby smiles,
passes cloud after cloud
and the bride flowers expend a freshness,
and the soul is a bride
in a still place, and the groom is red and forgetful, he is featureless
?
behind the glass of this car
the world purrs, shutoff and gentle
and i am darksuited and still, a member of the party,
gliding up in low gear behind the cart
and the priest is a vessel,
a tarred fabric, sorry and dull,
following the coffin on its flowery cart like a beautiful woman,
a crest of breasts, eyelids and lips
storming the hilltop
then, from the barred yard, the children
iq
smell the melt of shoeblacking,
their faces turning, wordless and slow,
their eyes opening
on a wonderful thing
six round black hats in the grass and a lozenge of wood,
and a naked mouth, red and awkward
for a minute the sky pours into the hole like plasma
there is no hope, it is given up

you come in late, wiping your lips
what did i leave untouched on the doorstep
white nike,
streaming between my walls ?
smilingly, blue lightning
assumes, like a meathook, the burden of his parts
the police love you, you confess everything
bright hair, shoeblack, old plastic,
is my life so intriguing?
is it for this you widen your eyerings ?
is it for this the air motes depart ?
they are not air motes, they are corpuscles
open your handbag what is that bad smell ?
it is your knitting, busily
hooking itself to itself,
it is your sticky candies

i have your head on my wall
navel cords, bluered and lucent,
shriek from my belly like arrows, and these i ride
moonglow, o sick one,
the stolen horses, the fornications
circle a womb of marble
where are you going
that you suck breath like mileage ?
sulfurous adulteries grieve in a dream
cold glass, how you insert yourself
between myself and myself
scratch like a cat
the blood that runs is dark fruit
an effect, a cosmetic
you smile
no, it is not fatal

words heard, by accident, over the

o mud, mud, how fluid
thick as foreign coffee, and with a sluggy pulse
speak, speak who is it ?
it is the bowelpulse, lover of digestibles
it is he who has achieved these syllables
what are these words, these words ?
they are plopping like mud
o god, how shall i ever clean the phone table?

they are pressing out of the manyholed earpiece, they are looking for a
listener

but the spawn percolate in my heart they are fertile
muck funnel, muck funnel
you are too big they must take you back

poppies in july
little poppies, little hell flames,
do you do no harm ?
you flicker i cannot touch you
i put my hands among the flames nothing burns
and it exhausts me to watch you
flickering like that, wrinkly and clear red, like the skin of a mouth
a mouth just bloodied
little bloody skirts
there are fumes that i cannot touch
where are your opiates, your nauseous capsules ?
if i could bleed, or sleep
if my mouth could marry a hurt like that
or your liquors seep to me, in this glass capsule,
dulling and stilling
but colorless colorless

burning the letters
i made a fire being tired
of the white fists of old
letters and their death rattle
when i came too close to the wastebasket
what did they know that i didnt?
grain by grain, they unrolled
sands where a dream of clear water
grinned like a getaway car
i am not subtle
love, love, and well, i was tired
of cardboard cartons the color of cement or a dog pack
holding in its hate
dully, under a pack of men in red jackets,
and the eyes and times of the postmarks
this fire may lick and fawn, but it is merciless
a glass case
my fingers would enter although
they melt and sag, they are told
do not touch
and here is an end to the writing,
the spry hooks that bend and cringe, and the smiles, the smiles
and at least it will be a good place now, the attic
at least i wont be strung just under the surface,
dumb fish
with one tin eye,
watching for glints,
riding my arctic
between this wish and that wish
so i poke at the carbon birds in my housedress
they are more beautiful than my bodiless owl,
they console me
rising and flying, but blinded
they would flutter off, black and glittering, they would be coal an
only they have nothing to say to anybody
i have seen to that
with the butt of a rake
i flake up papers that breathe like people,
ig
i fan them out
between the yellow lettuces and the german cabbage
involved in its weird blue dreams,
involved as a foetus
and a name with black edges
wilts at my foot,
sinuous orchis
in a nest of roothairs and boredom
pale eyes, patentleather gutturals
warm rain greases my hair, extinguishes nothing
my veins glow like trees
the dogs are tearing a fox this is what it is like
a red burst and a cry
that splits from its ripped bag and does not stop
with the dead eye
and the stuffed expression, but goes on
dyeing the air,
telling the particles of the clouds, the leaves, the water
what immortality is that it is immortal

you will be aware of an absence, presently,
growing beside you, like a tree,
a death tree, color gone, an australian gum tree
balding, gelded by lightningan illusion,
and a sky like a pigs backside, an utter lack of attention
but right now you are dumb
and i love your stupidity,

and find no face but my own, and you think thats funny

a birthday present
what is this, behind this veil, is it ugly, is it beautiful ?
it is shimmering, has it breasts, has it edges ?
i am sure it is unique, i am sure it is just what i want
when i am quiet at my cooking i feel it looking, i feel it thinking
is this the one i am to appear for,
is this the elect one, the one with black eyepits and a scar?
measuring the flour, cutting off the surplus,
adhering to rules, to rules, to rules
is this the one for the annunciation ?
my god, what a laugh
but it shimmers, it does not stop, and i think it wants me
i would not mind if it was bones, or a pearl button
i do not want much of a present, anyway, this year
after all i am alive only by accident
i would have killed myself gladly that time any possible way
now there are these veils, shimmering like curtains,
the diaphanous satins of a january window
white as babies bedding and glittering with dead breath o ivory
it must be a tusk there, a ghostcolumn
can you not see i do not mind what it is
can you not give it to me ?
do not be ashamedi do not mind if it is small
iq
do not be mean, i am ready for enormity
let us sit down to it, one on either side, admiring the gleam,
the glaze, the mirrory variety of it
let us eat our last supper at it, like a hospital plate
i know why you will not give it to me,
you are terrified
the world will go up in a shriek, and your head with it,
bossed, brazen, an antique shield,
a marvel to your greatgrandchildren
do not be afraid, it is not so
i will only take it and go aside quietly
you will not even hear me opening it, no paper crackle,
no falling ribbons, no scream at the end
i do not think you credit me with this discretion
if you only knew how the veils were killing my days
to you they are only transparencies, clear air
but my god, the clouds are like cotton
armies of them they are carbon monoxide
sweetly, sweetly i breathe in,
filling my veins with invisibles, with the million
probable motes that tick the years off my life
you are silversuited for the occasion o adding machine
is it impossible for you to let something go and have it go whole ?
must you stamp each piece in purple,
must you kill what you can ?
there is this one thing i want today, and only you can give it to me
it stands at my window, big as the sky
it breathes from my sheets, the cold dead center
ig
where spilt lives congeal and stiffen to history
let it not come by the mail, finger by finger
let it not come by word of mouth, i should be sixty
by the time the whole of it was delivered, and too numb to use it
only let down the veil, the veil, the veil
if it were death
i would admire the deep gravity of it, its timeless eyes
i would know you were serious
there would be a nobility then, there would be a birthday
and the knife not carve, but enter
pure and clean as the cry of a baby,
and the universe slide from my side

the detective
what was she doing when it blew in
over the seven hills, the red furrow, the blue mountain ?
was she arranging cups ? it is important
was she at the window, listening ?
in that valley the train shrieks echo like souls on hooks
that is the valley of death, though the cows thrive
in her garden the lies were shaking out their moist silks
and the eyes of the killer moving sluglike and sidelong,
unable to face the fingers, those egotists
the fingers were tamping a woman into a wall,
a body into a pipe, and the smoke rising
this is the smell of years burning, here in the kitchen,
these are the deceits, tacked up like family photographs,
and this is a man, look at his smile,
the death weapon? no one is dead
ig
there is no body in the house at all
there is the smell of polish, there are plush carpets
there is the sunlight, playing its blades,
bored hoodlum in a red room
where the wireless talks to itself like an elderly relative
did it come like an arrow, did it come like a knife ?
which of the poisons is it?
which of the nervecurlers, the convulsors? did it electrify?
this is a case without a body
the body does not come into it at all
it is a case of vaporization
the mouth first, its absence reported
in the second year it had been insatiable
and in punishment was hung out like brown fruit
to wrinkle and dry
the breasts next
these were harder, two white stones
the milk came yellow, then blue and sweet as water
there was no absence of lips, there were two children,
but their bones showed, and the moon smiled
then the dry wood, the gates,
the brown motherly furrows, the whole estate
we walk on air, watson
there is only the moon, embalmed in phosphorus
there is only a crow in a tree make notes

the courage of shuttingup
the courage of the shut mouth, in spite of artillery
the line pink and quiet, a worm, basking
there are black disks behind it, the disks of outrage,
and the outrage of a sky, the lined brain of it
the disks revolve, they ask to be heard
ig
loaded, as they are, with accounts of bastardies
bastardies, usages, desertions and doubleness,
the needle journeying in its groove,
silver beast between two dark canyons,
a great surgeon, now a tattooist,
tattooing over and over the same blue grievances,
the snakes, the babies, the tits
on mermaids and twolegged dreamgirls
the surgeon is quiet, he does not speak
he has seen too much death, his hands are full of it
so the disks of the brain revolve, like the muzzles of cannon
then there is that antique billhook, the tongue,
indefatigable, purple must it be cut out ?
it has nine tails, it is dangerous
and the noise it flays from the air, once it gets going
no, the tongue, too, has been put by,
hung up in the library with the engravings of rangoon
and the fox heads, the otter heads, the heads of dead rabbits
it is a marvelous object
the things it has pierced in its time
but how about the eyes, the eyes, the eyes ?
mirrors can kill and talk, they are terrible rooms
in which a torture goes on one can only watch
the face that lived in this mirror is the face of a dead man
do not worry about the eyes
they may be white and shy, they are no stool pigeons,
their death rays folded like flags
of a country no longer heard of,
an obstinate independency
insolvent among the mountains

the bee meeting
who are these people at the bridge to meet me ? they are the
villagers
the rector, the midwife, the sexton, the agent for bees
in my sleeveless summery dress i have no protection,
and they are all gloved and covered, why did nobody tell me?
they are smiling and taking out veils tacked to ancient hats
i am nude as a chicken neck, does nobody love me ?
yes, here is the secretary of bees with her white shop smock,
buttoning the cuffs at my wrists and the slit from my neck to my knees
now i am milkweed silk, the bees will not notice
they will not smell my fear, my fear, my fear
which is the rector now, is it that man in black ?
which is the midwife, is that her blue coat?
everybody is nodding a square black head, they are knights in visors,
breastplates of cheesecloth knotted under the armpits
their smiles and their voices are changing i am led through a beanfield
strips of tinfoil winking like people,
feather dusters fanning their hands in a sea of bean flowers,
creamy bean flowers with black eyes and leaves like bored hearts
is it blood clots the tendrils are dragging up that string ?
no, no, it is scarlet flowers that will one day be edible
now they are giving me a fashionable white straw italian hat
and a black veil that molds to my face, they are making me one of them
they are leading me to the shorn grove, the circle of hives
is it the hawthorn that smells so sick ?
the barren body of hawthorn, etherizing its children
is it some operation that is taking place ?
it is the surgeon my neighbors are waiting for,
this apparition in a green helmet,
shining gloves and white suit
is it the butcher, the grocer, the postman, someone i know?
i cannot run, i am rooted, and the gorse hurts me
with its yellow purses, its spiky armory
ig
i could not run without having to run forever
the white hive is snug as a virgin,
sealing off her brood cells, her honey, and quietly humming
smoke rolls and scarves in the grove
the mind of the hive thinks this is the end of everything
here they come, the outriders, on their hysterical elastics
if i stand very still, they will think i am cowparsley,
a gullible head untouched by their animosity,
not even nodding, a personage in a hedgerow
the villagers open the chambers, they are hunting the queen
is she hiding, is she eating honey ? she is very clever
she is old, old, old, she must live another year, and she knows it
while in their fingerjoint cells the new virgins
dream of a duel they will win inevitably,
a curtain of wax dividing them from the bride flight,
the upflight of the murderess into a heaven that loves her
the villagers are moving the virgins, there will be no killing
the old queen does not show herself, is she so ungrateful ?
i am exhausted, i am exhausted
pillar of white in a blackout of knives
i am the magicians girl who does not flinch
the villagers are untying their disguises, they are shaking hands
whose is that long white box in the grove, what have they accomplished,
why am i cold
j october ig
the arrival of the bee box
i ordered this, this clean wood box
square as a chair and almost too heavy to lift
i would say it was the coffin of a midget
or a square baby
were there not such a din in it
ig
the box is locked, it is dangerous
i have to live with it overnight
and i cant keep away from it
there are no windows, so i cant see what is in there
there is only a little grid, no exit
i put my eye to the grid
it is dark, dark,
with the swarmy feeling of african hands
minute and shrunk for export,
black on black, angrily clambering
how can i let them out ?
it is the noise that appalls me most of all,
the unintelligible syllables
it is like a roman mob,
small, taken one by one, but my god, together
i lay my ear to furious latin
i am not a caesar
i have simply ordered a box of maniacs
they can be sent back
they can die, i need feed them nothing, i am the owner
i wonder how hungry they are
i wonder if they would forget me
if i just undid the locks and stood back and turned into a tree
there is the laburnum, its blond colonnades,
and the petticoats of the cherry
they might ignore me immediately
in my moon suit and funeral veil
i am no source of honey
so why should they turn on me ?
tomorrow i will be sweet god, i will set them free
the box is only temporary
october iq
i go
stings
barehanded, i hand the combs
the man in white smiles, barehanded,
our cheesecloth gauntlets neat and sweet,
the throats of our wrists brave lilies
he and i
have a thousand clean cells between us,
eight combs of yellow cups,
and the hive itself a teacup,
white with pink flowers on it,
with excessive love i enameled it
thinking sweetness, sweetness
brood cells gray as the fossils of shells
terrify me, they seem so old
what am i buying, wormy mahogany ?
is there any queen at all in it ?
if there is, she is old,
her wings torn shawls, her long body
rubbed of its plush
poor and bare and unqueenly and even shameful
i stand in a column
of winged, unmiraculous women,
honeydrudgers
i am no drudge
though for years i have eaten dust
and dried plates with my dense hair
and seen my strangeness evaporate,
blue dew from dangerous skin
will they hate me,
these women who only scurry,
whose news is the open cherry, the open clover ?
it is almost over
i am in control
here is my honeymachine,
iq
it will work without thinking,
opening, in spring, like an industrious virgin
to scour the creaming crests
as the moon, for its ivory powders, scours the sea
a third person is watching
he has nothing to do with the beeseller or with me
now he is gone
in eight great bounds, a great scapegoat
here is his slipper, here is another,
and here the square of white linen
he wore instead of a hat
he was sweet,
the sweat of his efforts a rain
tugging the world to fruit
the bees found him out,
molding onto his lips like lies,
complicating his features
they thought death was worth it, but i
have a self to recover, a queen
is she dead, is she sleeping ?
where has she been,
with her lionred body, her wings of glass ?
now she is flying
more terrible than she ever was, red
scar in the sky, red comet
over the engine that killed her
the mausoleum, the wax house
october
the swarm
somebody is shooting at something in our town
a dull pom, pom in the sunday street
jealousy can open the blood,
iq
it can make black roses
who are they shooting at?
it is you the knives are out for
at waterloo, waterloo, napoleon,
the hump of elba on your short back,
and the snow, marshaling its brilliant cutlery
mass after mass, saying shh
shh these are chess people you play with,
still figures of ivory
the mud squirms with throats,
stepping stones for french bootsoles
the gilt and pink domes of russia melt and float off
in the furnace of greed clouds, clouds
so the swarm balls and deserts
seventy feet up, in a black pine tree
it must be shot down pom pom
so dumb it thinks bullets are thunder
it thinks they are the voice of god
condoning the beak, the claw, the grin of the dog
yellowhaunched, a packdog,
grinning over its bone of ivory
like the pack, the pack, like everybody
the bees have got so far seventy feet high
russia, poland and germany
the mild hills, the same old magenta
fields shrunk to a penny
spun into a river, the river crossed
the bees argue, in their black ball,
a flying hedgehog, all prickles
the man with gray hands stands under the honeycomb
of their dream, the hived station
where trains, faithful to their steel arcs,
ig
leave and arrive, and there is no end to the country
pom pom they fall
dismembered, to a tod of ivy
so much for the charioteers, the outriders, the grand army
a red tatter, napoleon
the last badge of victory
the swarm is knocked into a cocked straw hat
elba, elba, bleb on the sea
the white busts of marshals, admirals, generals
worming themselves into niches
how instructive this is
the dumb, banded bodies
walking the plank draped with mother frances upholstery
into a new mausoleum,
an ivory palace, a crotch pine
the man with gray hands smiles
the smile of a man of business, intensely practical
they are not hands at all
but asbestos receptacles
pom pom they would have killed me
stings big as drawing pins
it seems bees have a notion of honor,
a black intractable mind
napoleon is pleased, he is pleased with everything
o europe o ton of honey

wintering
this is the easy time, there is nothing doing
i have whirled the midwifes extractor,
i have my honey,
six jars of it,
six cats eyes in the wine cellar,
iq
wintering in a dark without window
at the heart of the house
next to the last tenants rancid jam
and the bottles of empty glitters
sir soandsos gin
this is the room i have never been in
this is the room i could never breathe in
the black bunched in there like a bat,
no light
but the torch and its faint
chinese yellow on appalling objects
black asininity decay
possession
it is they who own me
neither cruel nor indifferent,
only ignorant
this is the time of hanging on for the beesthe bees
so slow i hardly know them,
filing like soldiers
to the syrup tin
to make up for the honey ive taken
tate and lyle keeps them going,
the refined snow
it is tate and lyle they live on, instead of flowers
they take it the cold sets in
now they ball in a mass,
black
mind against all that white
the smile of the snow is white
it spreads itself out, a milelong body of meissen,
into which, on warm days,
they can only carry their dead
the bees are all women,
maids and the long royal lady
they have got rid of the men,
ig
the blunt, clumsy stumblers, the boors
winter is for women
the woman, still at her knitting,
at the cradle of spanish walnut,
her body a bulb in the cold and too dumb to think
will the hive survive, will the gladiolas
succeed in banking their fires
to enter another year ?
what will they taste of, the christmas roses ?
the bees are flying they taste the spring

you are blue and huge, a traffic policeman,
holding up one palm
a difference between us ?
i have one eye, you have two
the secret is stamped on you,
faint, undulant watermark
will it show in the black detector?
will it come out
wavery, indelible, true
through the african giraffe in its edeny greenery,
the moroccan hippopotamus ?
they stare from a square, stiff frill
they are for export,
one a fool, the other a fool
a secret an extra amber
brandy finger
roosting and cooing you, you
behind two eyes in which nothing is reflected but monkeys

a knife that can be taken out
to pare nails,
to lever the dirt

that big blue head
how it breathes in the bureau drawer
is that lingerie, pet?
it smells of salt cod, you had better
stab a few cloves in an apple,
make a sachet or
do away with the bastard
do away with it altogether
no, no, it is happy there
but it wants to get out
look, look it is wanting to crawl
my god, there goes the stopper
the cars in the place de la concorde
watch out
a stampede, a stampede
horns twirling and jungle gutturals
an exploded bottle of stout,
slack foam in the lap

dwarf baby,
the knife in your back
i feel weak

black and stiff, but not a bad fit
will you marry it ?

daddy
you do not do, you do not do

in which i have lived like a foot
for thirty years, poor and white,
barely daring to breathe or achoo
daddy, i have had to kill you
you died before i had time
s marbleheavy, a bag full of god,
ghastly statue with one gray toe
big as a frisco seal
and a head in the freakish atlantic
where it pours bean green over blue
in the waters off beautiful nauset
i used to pray to recover you
ach, du

scraped flat by the roller
of wars, wars, wars
but the name of the town is common
my polack friend

says there are a dozen or two
so i never could tell where you
put your foot, your root,
i never could talk to you
the tongue stuck in my jaw
it stuck in a barb wire snare
ich, ich, ich, ich,
i could hardly speak
i thought every german was you
and the language obscene
an engine, an engine
chuffing me off like a jew
a jew to dachau, auschwitz, belsen
i began to talk like a jew
i think i may well be a jew
the snows of the tyrol, the clear beer of vienna
are not very pure or true
with my gipsy ancestress and my weird luck
and my taroc pack and my taroc pack
i may be a bit of a jew
i have always been scared of you,
with your luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo
and your neat mustache
and your aryan eye, bright blue
panzerman, panzerman, o you
not god but a swastika
so black no sky could squeak through
every woman adores a fascist,
the boot in the face, the brute
brute heart of a brute like you
you stand at the blackboard, daddy,
in the picture i have of you,
a cleft in your chin instead of your foot
but no less a devil for that, no not
any less the black man who
ig
bit my pretty red heart in two
i was ten when they buried you
at twenty i tried to die
and get back, back, back to you
i thought even the bones would do
but they pulled me out of the sack,
and they stuck me together with glue
and then i knew what to do
i made a model of you,
a man in black with a meinkampf look
and a love of the rack and the screw
and i said i do, i do
so daddy, im finally through
the black telephones off at the root,
the voices just cant worm through
if ive killed one man, ive killed two
the vampire who said he was you
and drank my blood for a year,
seven years, if you want to know
daddy, you can lie back now
theres a stake in your fat black heart
and the villagers never liked you
they are dancing and stamping on you
they always knew it was you
daddy, daddy, you bastard, im through

plying their wild cells in my keels shadow,
pushing by like hearts,
red stigmata at the very center,
riding the rip tide to the nearest point of departure,
dragging their jesus hair
did i escape, i wonder?
my mind winds to you
old barnacled umbilicus, atlantic cable,
keeping itself, it seems, in a state of miraculous repair
in any case, you are always there,
tremulous breath at the end of my line,
curve of water upleaping
to my water rod, dazzling and grateful,
touching and sucking
i didnt call you
i didnt call you at all
nevertheless, nevertheless
you steamed to me over the sea,
fat and red, a placenta
paralysing the kicking lovers
cobra light
squeezing the breath from the blood bells
of the fuchsia i could draw no breath,
dead and moneyless,
overexposed, like an xray
who do you think you are ?
a communion wafer ? blubbery mary ?
i shall take no bite of your body,
bottle in which i live,
ghastly vatican

seven hours knocked out of my right mind
into a black sack
where i relax, foetus or cat,
lever of his wet dreams
something is gone
my sleeping capsule, my red and blue zeppelin
drops me from a terrible altitude
carapace smashed,
i spread to the beaks of birds
little gimlets
what holes this papery day is already full of
he has been burning me with cigarettes,
pretending i am a negress with pink paws
am myself that is not enough
the fever trickles and stiffens in my hair
my ribs show what have i eaten ?
lies and smiles
surely the sky is not that color,
surely the grass should be rippling
ig
all day, gluing my church of burnt matchsticks,
i dream of someone else entirely
and he, for this subversion,
hurts me, he
with his armor of fakery,
his high cold masks of amnesia
how did i get here ?
indeterminate criminal,
i die with variety
hung, starved, burned, hooked
i imagine him
impotent as distant thunder,
in whose shadow i have eaten my ghost ration
i wish him dead or away
that, it seems, is the impossibility
that being free what would the dark
do without fevers to eat ?
what would the light
do without eyes to knife, what would he
do, do, do without me ?

coy paper strips for doors
stage curtains, a widows frizz

such yellow sullen smokes
make their own element they will not rise,

choking the aged and the meek,
the weak
hothouse baby in its crib,
the ghastly orchid
hanging its hanging garden in the air,
devilish leopard

heaven would be something else,

the dear, green, quite breathable atmosphere,
cold grits underfoot,

it never occurred that they had been forgot,
that the big god
had lazily closed one eye and let them slip

it is very late
the dull bells tongue the hour
the mirror floats us at one candle power
this is the fluid in which we meet each other,
this haloey radiance that seems to breathe
and lets our shadows wither
only to blow
them huge again, violent giants on the wall
one match scratch makes you real
at first the candle will not bloom at all

that keeps the sky at bay,
the sack of black it is everywhere, tight, tight

they had to call and call
and pick the worms off me like sticky pearls
dying

i do it exceptionally well
i do it so it feels like hell

a hospital of dolls

pumped ahead by these pistons, this blood

charred skirts and deathmask
mourned by religious figures, by garlanded children

turning and turning in the middle air,
untouched and untouchable
the train is dragging itself, it is screaming
an animal
insane for the destination,

the face at the end of the flare

i shall count and bury the dead
let their souls writhe in a dew,

such coldness, forgetfulness

warm and human, then their pink light
bleeding and peeling

my soul dies before it
and the hooves of the horses,
their merciless churn

more and more like a dead one,
worms in the glottal stops

in munich, morgue between paris and rome,
naked and bald in their furs,
orange lollies on silver sticks,

nobodys about in the hotels
hands will be opening doors and setting

the engine is killing the track, the track is silver,
it stretches into the distance it will be eaten nevertheless
its running is useless

swaying slightly in their thick suits,
white towers of smithfield ahead,
fat haunches and blood on their minds
there is no mercy in the glitter of cleavers,
the butchers guillotine that whispers hows this, hows this?
in the bowl the hare is aborted,
its baby head out of the way, embalmed in spice,
flayed of fur and humanity
let us eat it like platos afterbirth,
let us eat it like christ
these are the people that were important
their round eyes, their teeth, their grimaces
on a stick that rattles and clicks, a counterfeit snake
shall the hood of the cobra appall me
the loneliness of its eye, the eye of the mountains
through which the sky eternally threads itself?
the world is bloodhot and personal
dawn says, with its bloodflush
there is no terminus, only suitcases
out of which the same self unfolds like a suit
bald and shiny, with pockets of wishes,

notions and tickets, short circuits and folding mirrors

no rings through the nose, no cries
bright fish hooks, the smiles of women
gulp at my bulk

the air is a mill of hooks
questions without answer,
glittering and drunk as flies
whose kiss stings unbearably
in the fetid wombs of black air under pines in summer
i remember
the dead smell of sun on wood cabins,
the stiffness of sails, the long salt winding sheets
once one has seen god, what is the remedy ?
once one has been seized up
without a part left over,
not a toe, not a finger, and used,
used utterly, in the suns conflagrations, the stains
that lengthen from ancient cathedrals
what is the remedy ?
the pill of the communion tablet,
the walking beside still water ? memory ?

or picking up the bright pieces
of christ in the faces of rodents,
the tame flowernibblers, the ones
whose hopes are so low they are comfortable
the humpback in his small, washed cottage
under the spokes of the clematis
is there no great love, only tenderness ?
does the sea
remember the walker upon it ?
meaning leaks from the molecules
the chimneys of the city breathe, the window sweats,
the children leap in their cots
the sun blooms, it is a geranium
the heart has not stopped

dame kindness, she is so nice
the blue and red jewels of her rings smoke
in the windows, the mirrors

what is so real as the cry of a child ?
a rabbits cry may be wilder
but it has no soul
sugar can cure everything, so kindness says
sugar is a necessary fluid,
its crystals a little poultice
o kindness, kindness
sweetly picking up pieces
my japanese silks, desperate butterflies,
may be pinned any minute, anesthetized

and here you come, with a cup of tea
wreathed in steam
the blood jet is poetry,
there is no stopping it
you hand me two children, two roses

since christmas they have lived with us,
guileless and clear,
oval soulanimals,
taking up half the space,

invisible air drifts,
giving a shriek and pop

yellow cathead, blue fish
such queer moons we live with
instead of dead furniture
straw mats, white walls
and these traveling
globes of thin air, red, green,
delighting
the heart like wishes or free
peacocks blessing
old ground with a feather
beaten in starry metals
your small
brother is making
his balloon squeak like a cat
seeming to see
a funny pink world he might eat on the other side of it,
he bites,
then sits
back, fat jug
contemplating a world clear as water
a red

the woman is perfected
her dead
body wears the smile of accomplishment,
the illusion of a greek necessity
flows in the scrolls of her toga,
her bare
feet seem to be saying
we have come so far, it is over
each dead child coiled, a white serpent,
one at each little
pitcher of milk, now empty
she has folded
i
them back into her body as petals
of a rose close when the garden
stiffens and odors bleed
from the sweet, deep throats of the night flower
the moon has nothing to be sad about,
staring from her hood of bone
she is used to this sort of thing
her blacks crackle and drag

go get the glass, then but i know tonight will be
in every respect like every other night
while were sitting, face to face across the coffee
table, trying our luck, index fingers set
on the round base of the inverted wineglass here,
theyll go by, trundling like marble statues way out
in the wings somewhere, or like heirloom furniture
moving, being moved and well imagine
a great frieze, egyptian, perhaps, or greek,
and their eyes looking out of it keen,
with the cold burn dry ice has yet the clock

the letters live in the same place or else
each time must learn the letters new are
you to ask whos home, or i?

leroy
you know i dont, and still
sibyl  and still im skeptic i know im being foolish
i suppose if i didnt trust you at this
i wouldnt trust myself t h e faults my faith
in pan its been ebbing ever since the mess
he made of the football poolsteasing us with
near wins, week by week, waiting until
we thought wed trained him, before going haywire truth
isnt in him
leroy
maybe but maybe the pools
bored him hes more philosopher, it seems,
than financier
sibyl
what good is he, if not
for fortunetelling? and where is it fortune comes
from, if not the pools?
leroy
oh, from a lot

or your whitehaired benefactress, who may see fit
t o alter her will our way shall we go on
asking about money?
sibyl

well what, then?

thats the trouble lets say he
really can see into the future what,
pools aside, wills aside, do we
really want to know about?

do you
honestly want to find if youll have a fling
at fame or not? as for love, i figure when were
out of it will be time and plenty for us
t o court remorse or someone else id rather
sift him about the afterlife than this
its not so imminent at least i feel
less dread of the world beyond than ours
leroy
thats because
you dont quite believe in it youre deaf to real
dangers, but dont mind hearing about the ones
in hell, since hells a fairytale
sibyl
i would
believe, if they could manage to convince
me
leroy  ask, anyhow
sibyl
i admit it im afraid,
always, the glass will blurt what i dont want
t o know at all and yet i go ahead
pan, are you still there?

you persist in spelling halfhints

pan said a plumage of raw worms
sibyl

tedious thats what wed say about rot
feeding at the root of things he stole that, too,
as he stole our perplexities about the pools
and tricked us to trust his vision, while night after night he
palmed off our own hunches as oracles
i was perfectly right pans a mere puppet
of our two intuitions

tables and chairs can elbow us with ease
out of our very countenance by simply
bulking more real than we think we are we face
obliteration hourly unless our eye
can whipcrack the tables into tigers and foist
castles upon the smugshaped chairs

leroy
you waste no time
eating your words youll revoke his godhood soon as
his drift endorses your inklings of a doom
descended on your favorites, and yet
youll issue him his pass to angeldom

a rigor seized me i saw cracks appear,
dilating to craters in this livingroom,

q u e e n marys rose garden
in this day before the day nobody is about
a sea of dreams washes the edge of my green island
in the center of the garden named after queen mary
the great roses, many of them scentless,
rule their beds like beheaded and resurrected and all silent royalty,
the only fare on my bare breakfast plate
such a waste of brightness i cant understand
it is six in the morning and finer than any sunday
yet there is no walker and looker but myself
the sky of the city is white the light from the country
some ducks step down off their greenreeded shelf
and into the silver element of the pond
i see them start to cruise and dip for food
under the belljar of a wonderland
hedged in and evidently inviolate
though hundreds of londoners know it like the palm of their hand
the roses are named after queens and people of note
or after gay days, or colors the grower found good

parliament hill fields part of hampstead heath, in north london introducing
this poem in a bbc broadcast, sp said this poem is a monologue i imagine the
landscape of parliament hill fields in london seen by a person overwhelmed by an
emotion so powerful as to color and distort the scenery the speaker here is caught
between the old and the new year, between the grief caused by the loss of a child

compared to you, i am corruptible as a loaf of bread
while i sleep, the black spores nod
their magnified heads and plan to kill me as soon as possible
the wrinkles creep up like waves,
one camouflaging itself behind another
i should have a steel complexion like yours
in which the minutes could admire their reflections and forget about me

i try to think of a place to hide you
as a desk drawer hides a poison pen letter,
but there is no drawer to hold you
blue sky or black
you preoccupy my horizon
what good is all that space if it cant draw you off?
you are the one eye out there
the sea, also, is ineffectual
it keeps washing you up like an old bone
and i, on the skymirroring, bland sands
find you over and over, lipped like a skate and smiling,
with the sound of the sea in your mouth
angel of coldness,
surely it is not i you want so badly
i thought earth might use you
she has a terrible way with minerals,
but even her tonnage doesnt impress a diamond
your facets are indestructible
their lights whiten my heart
toadstone i see i must wear you in the centre of my forehead
and let the dead sleep as they deserve

speaking about this poem in a bbc radio broadcast, she said i do not like to think
of all the things, familiar, useful and worthy things, i have never put into a poem i did,
once, put a yew tree in and that yew tree began, with astounding egotism, to manage
and order the whole affair it was not a yew tree by a church on a road past a house in a
town where a certain woman lived    and so on, as it might have been in a novel oh
no it stood squarely in the middle of my poem, manipulating its dark shades, the
voices in the churchyard, the clouds, the birds, the tender melancholy with which i
contemplated iteverything i couldnt subdue it and, in the end, my poem was a
poem about a yew tree the yew tree was just too proud to be a passing black mark in a
novel

stings the first stirring of this sequence of poems appeared on  august, when sp
attempted to write a poem, which she never finalized in any way, titled stings the
following can be extracted from a mass of corrected manuscript
what honey summons these animalcules ?
what fear? it has set them zinging
on envious strings, and you are the center
they are assailing your brain like numerals,
they contort your hair
beneath the flat handkerchief you wear instead of a hat
they are making a cats cradle, they are suicidal
their deathpegs stud your gloves, it is no use running
the black veil molds to your lips
they are fools
after, they stagger and weave, under no banner
after, they crawl
dispatched, into trenches of grass
ossifying like junked statues
gelded and wingless not heroes not heroes




the swarm when bees swarm, they sometimes cluster in a ball high in a tree, while
they make up their minds where to go any loud sudden noise, such as gunfire, can
make them come down to a much lower level where the beekeeper can reach them, and
collect them into a box or skip he then shakes the whole lot out on to a broad surface
that slopes up into a fresh empty hive the bees obediently march up into the hive, as
described towards the end of this poem
the poet uses an incident she watched in a neighbouring beekeepers garden

she had made a somewhat earlier but undated attempt to break through to the
substance of this poem after several pages of what looks like feverish exploration of
the theme, her earlier controls took over, and reduced the confusion to the following,

this poem is about the double or schizophrenic nature of deaththe marmoreal
coldness of blakes death mask, say, hand in glove with the fearful softness of worms,
water and other katabolists i imagine these two aspects of death as two men, two
business friends, who have come to call

translation
the only translations by sylvia plath that survive are four sonnets of ronsard and one poem
by rilke, made in the course of studying french and german literature following is her
literal rendering of rilkes a prophet, made about
dilated by immense visions
bright with the firelight from the outcome
of judgments, which never destroy him,
are his eyes, gazing out from under thick
brows and in his inmost soul
already words are raising themselves again
not his words for what would his be
and how indulgently would they be lavished ?
but others, severe pieces of iron, stones,
which he must dissolve like a volcano
in order to cast them forth in the outburst
from his mouth, which curses and damns
while his forehead, like the face of a hound
seeks to transmit that
which the master chooses within his mind
this one, this one, whom they all might find
if they followed the great pointing hand
which reveals him as he is enraged

the fifty poems printed here are a selection from sylvia plaths work produced

assignments for her english professor at smith college, alfred young fisher, and

have followed his textual suggestions
bitter strawberries
all that morning in the strawberry field
they talked about the russians
squatted down between the rows
we listened
we heard the head woman say,
bomb them off the map
horseflies buzzed, paused and stung
and the taste of strawberries
turned thick and sour
mary said slowly, ive got a fella
old enough to go
if anything should happen
the sky was high and blue
two children laughed at tag
in the tall grass,
leaping awkward and longlegged
across the rutted road
the fields were full of bronzed young men
hoeing lettuce, weeding celery
the draft is passed, the woman said
we ought to have bombed them long ago
dont, pleaded the little girl
with blond braids
juvenilia
her blue eyes swam with vague terror
she added pettishly, i cant see why
youre always talking this way
oh, stop worrying, nelda,
snapped the woman sharply
she stood up, a thin commanding figure
in faded dungarees
businesslike she asked us, how many quarts?
she recorded the total in her notebook,
and we all turned back to picking
kneeling over the rows,
we reached among the leaves
with quick practiced hands,
cupping the berry protectively before
snapping off the stem
between thumb and forefinger
family reunion
outside in the street i hear
a car door slam voices coming near
incoherent scraps of talk
and high heels clicking up the walk
the doorbell rends the noonday heat
with copper claws
a seconds pause
the dull drums of my pulses beat
against a silence wearing thin
the door now opens from within
oh, hear the clash of people meeting
the laughter and the screams of greeting
fat always, and out of breath,
a greasy smack on every cheek
from aunt elizabeth
there, thats the pink, pleased squeak
of cousin jane, our spinster with
the faded eyes
and hands like nervous butterflies
while rough as splintered wood
across them all
rasps the jarring baritone of uncle paul
juvenilia
the youngest nephew gives a fretful whine
and drools at the reception line
like a diver on a lofty spar of land
atop the flight of stairs i stand
a whirlpool leers at me,
absorbent as a sponge
i cast off my identity
and make the fatal plunge
female author
all day she plays at chess with the bones of the world
favored while suddenly the rains begin
beyond the window she lies on cushions curled
and nibbles an occasional bonbon of sin
prim, pinkbreasted, feminine, she nurses
chocolate fancies in rosepapered rooms
where polished highboys whisper creaking curses
and hothouse roses shed immoral blooms
the garnets on her fingers twinkle quick
and blood reflects across the manuscript
she muses on the odor, sweet and sick,
of festering gardenias in a crypt,
and lost in subtle metaphor, retreats
from gray child faces crying in the streets
april
the slime of all my yesterdays
rots in the hollow of my skull
and if my stomach would contract
because of some explicable phenomenon
such as pregnancy or constipation
i would not remember you
juvenilia
or that because of sleep
infrequent as a moon of greencheese
that because of food
nourishing as violet leaves
that because of these
and in a few fatal yards of grass
in a few spaces of sky and treetops
a future was lost yesterday
as easily and irretrievably
as a tennis ball at twilight
gold mouths cry
gold mouths cry with the green young
certainty of the bronze boy
remembering a thousand autumns
and how a hundred thousand leaves
came sliding down his shoulderblades
persuaded by his bronze heroic reason
we ignore the coming doom of gold
and we are glad in this bright metal season
even the dead laugh among the goldenrod
the bronze boy stands kneedeep in centuries,
and never grieves,
remembering a thousand autumns,
with sunlight of a thousand years upon his lips
and his eyes gone blind with leaves
dirge for a joker
always in the middle of a kiss
came the profane stimulus to cough
always from the pulpit during service
leaned the devil prompting you to laugh
behind mockceremony of your grief
lurked the burlesque instinct of the ham
you never altered your amused belief
that life was a mere monumental sham
juvenilia
from the comic accident of birth
to the final grotesque joke of death
your malady of sacrilegious mirth
spread gay contagion with each clever breath
now you must play the straight man for a term
and tolerate the humor of the worm
to eva descending the stair
a villanelle
clocks cry stillness is a lie, my dear
the wheels revolve, the universe keeps running
proud you halt upon the spiral stair
the asteroids turn traitor in the air,
and planets plot with old elliptic cunning
clocks cry stillness is a lie, my dear
red the unraveled rose sings in your hair
blood springs eternal if the heart be burning
proud you halt upon the spiral stair
cryptic stars wind up the atmosphere,
in solar schemes the tilted suns go turning
clocks cry stillness is a lie, my dear
loud the immortal nightingales declare
love flames forever if the flesh be yearning
proud you halt upon the spiral stair
circling zodiac compels the year
intolerant beauty never will be learning
clocks cry stillness is a lie, my dear
proud you halt upon the spiral stair
cinderella
the prince leans to the girl in scarlet heels,
her green eyes slant, hair flaring in a fan
of silver as the rondo slows now reels
begin on tilted violins to span
juvenilia
the whole revolving tall glass palace hall
where guests slide gliding into light like wine
rose candles flicker on the lilac wall
reflecting in a million flagons shine,
and gilded couples all in whirling trance
follow holiday revel begun long since,
until near twelve the strange girl all at once
guiltstricken halts, pales, clings to the prince
as amid the hectic music and cocktail talk
she hears the caustic ticking of the clock
jilted
my thoughts are crabbed and sallow,
my tears like vinegar,
or the bitter blinking yellow
of an acetic star
tonight the caustic wind, love,
gossips late and soon,
and i wear the wryfaced pucker of
the sour lemon moon
while like an early summer plum,
puny, green, and tart,
droops upon its wizened stem
my lean, unripened heart
sonnet to eva
all right, lets say you could take a skull and break it
the way youd crack a clock youd crush the bone
between steel palms of inclination, take it,
observing the wreck of metal and rare stone
this was a woman her loves and stratagems
betrayed in mute geometry of broken
cogs and disks, inane mechanic whims,
and idle coils of jargon yet unspoken
juvenilia
not man nor demigod could put together
the scraps of rusted reverie, the wheels
of notched tin platitudes concerning weather,
perfume, politics, and fixed ideals
the idiot bird leaps up and drunken leans
to chirp the hour in lunatic thirteens
bluebeard
i am sending back the key
that let me into bluebeards study

that let me into bluebeards study

stiffen the ordinary
malleable mask
to the granite grin of bone
for such a tempering task,
heat furnace of paradox
in an artifice of ice
make love and logic mix,
and remember, if tedious risk
seems to jeopardize this
it was a solar turbine
gave molten earth a frame,
juvenilia
and it took the diamond stone
a weight of world and time
being crystallized from carbon
to the hardest substance known
metamorphoses of the moon
cold moons withdraw, refusing to come to terms
with the pilot who dares all heavens harms
to raid the zone where fate begins,
flings silver gauntlet of his plane at space,
demanding satisfaction no duel takes place
the mute air merely thins and thins
sky wont be drawn closer absolute,
it holds aloof, a shrouded parachute
always the same distance from
the falling man who never will abstain
from asking, but inventive, hopes in vain
challenges the silent dome
no violation but gives dividends
of slow disaster the bitten apple ends
the eden of bucolic eve
understanding breaks through the skulls shell
and like a cuckoo in the nest makes hell
for naive larks who starve and grieve
what prince has ever seized the shining grail
but that it turned into a milking pail ?
its likely that each secret sought
will prove to be some common parlor fake
a craft with paint and powder that can make
cleopatra from a slut
for most exquisite truths are artifice
framed in disciplines of fire and ice
which conceal incongruous
elements like dirty socks and scraps
of dayold bread and eggstained plates perhaps
such sophistry can placate us
juvenilia
but yet the perverse imp within will probe
beneath the fringes of forbidden robe,
seduced by curiosity,
until in disenchantment our eyes glut
themselves on the clay toes and short clubfoot
which mar the idols sanctity
the choice between the mica mystery
of moonlight or the pockmarked face we see
through the scrupulous telescope
is always to be made innocence
is a fairytale intelligence
hangs itself on its own rope
either way we choose, the angry witch
will punish us for saying which is which
in fatal equilibrium
we poise on perilous poles that freeze us in
a cross of contradiction, racked between
the fact of doubt, the faith of dream
dialogue en route
if only something would happen
sighed eve, the elevatorgirl ace,
to adam the arrogant matador
as they shot past the fortyninth floor
in a rocketing vertical clockcase,
fast as a fallible falcon
i wish millionaire uncles and aunts
would umbrella like liberal toadstools
in a shower of chanel, dior gowns,
filet mignon and walloping wines,
a pack of philanthropical fools
to indulge my extravagant wants
erect in his folderol cloak
sham adam the matador cried
o may gmen all die of the choler,
and my every chimerical dollar
breed innumerable bills, bona fide
a hot hyperbolical joke
juvenilia
said eve i wish venomous nematodes
were bewitched to assiduous lovers,
each one an inveterate gallant
with valentinos crack technical talent
for recreation down under the covers

added adam, that simian swell,
with his modish opposable thumb
o for ubiquitous free aphrodisiacs,
and for pumpkins to purr into cadillacs
and voluptuous venus to come
waltzing up to me out of her cockleshell
breaking through gravitys garrison,
eve, the elevatorgirl ace,
and adam the arrogant matador
shot past the ninetyfourth floor
to corral the conundrum of space
at its cryptic celestial origin
they both watched the barometer sink
as the world swiveled round in its orbit
and thousands were born and dropped dead,
when, from the inane overhead
too quick for the pair to absorb it,
came a gargantuan galactic wink
to a jilted lover
cold on my narrow cot i lie
and in sorrow look
through my windowsquare of black
figured in the midnight sky,
a mosaic of stars
diagrams the falling years,
while from the moon, my lovers eye
chills me to death
with radiance of his frozen faith
juvenilia
once i wounded him with so
small a thorn
i never thought his flesh would burn
or that the heat within would grow
until he stood
incandescent as a god
now there is nowhere i can go
to hide from him
moon and sun reflect his flame
in the morning all shall be
the same again
stars pale before the angry dawn
the gilded cock will turn for me
the rack of time
until the peak of noon has come
and by that glare, my love will see
how i am still
blazing in my golden hell
the dream
last night, he said, i slept well
except for two uncanny dreams
that came before the change of weather
when i rose and opened all
the shutters to let warm wind feather
with wet plumage through my rooms
in the first dream i was driving
down the dark in a black hearse
with many men until i crashed
a light, and right away a raving
woman followed us and rushed
to halt our car in headlong course
juvenilia
crying, she came to the island
where we stopped, and with a curse
demanded that i pay a fine
for being such a rude assailant
and damaging the whole unseen
lighting plant of the universe
behind me then i heard a voice
warning me to hold her hand
and kiss her on the mouth for she
loved me and a brave embrace
would avoid all penalty
i know, i know, i told my friend
but yet i waited to be fined
and took the womans bright subpoena
while she washed the way with tears,
then drove to you upon the wind
i do not tell you the nightmare
which occurred to me in china
sonnet to time
today we move in jade and cease with garnet
amid the ticking jeweled clocks that mark
our years death comes in a casual steel car, yet
we vaunt our days in neon and scorn the dark
but outside the diabolic steel of this
most plasticwindowed city, i can hear
the lone wind raving in the gutter, his
voice crying exclusion in my ear
so cry for the pagan girl left picking olives
beside a sunblue sea, and mourn the flagon
raised to toast a thousand kings, for all gives
sorrow weep for the legendary dragon
time is a great machine of iron bars
that drains eternally the milk of stars
juvenilia
the trial of man
the ordinary milkman brought that dawn
of destiny, delivered to the door
in square hermetic bottles, while the sun
ruled decree of doomsday on the floor
the morning paper clocked the headline hour
you drank your coffee like original sin,
and at the jetplane anger of gods roar
got up to let the suave blue policeman in
impaled upon a stern angelic stare
you were condemned to serve the legal limit
and burn to death within your neon hell
now, disciplined in the strict ancestral chair,
you sit, solemneyed, about to vomit,
the future an electrode in your skull
april aubade
worship this world of watercolor mood
in glass pagodas hung with veils of green
where diamonds jangle hymns within the blood
and sap ascends the steeple of the vein
a saintly sparrow jargons madrigals
to waken dreamers in the milky dawn,
while tulips bow like a college of cardinals
before that papal paragon, the sun
christened in a spindrift of snowdrop stars,
where on pinkfluted feet the pigeons pass
and jonquils sprout like solomons metaphors,
my love and i go garlanded with grass
again we are deluded and infer
that somehow we are younger than we were
juvenilia
go get the goodly squab
go get the goodly squab in goldlobed corn
and pluck the drollflecked quail where thick they lie
reap the round blue pigeon from roof ridge,
but let the fastfeathered eagle fly
let the fastfeathered eagle fly
and the skies crack through with thunder
hide, hide, in the deep nest
lest the lightning strike you to cinder
go snare the sleeping bear in leaflined den
and trap the muskrat napping in slack sun
dupe the dull sow lounging snout in mud,
but let the galloping antelope run
let the galloping antelope run
and the snow blow up behind
hide, hide, in the safe cave
lest the blizzard drive you blind
go cull the purple snails from slothful shells
and bait the drowsing trout by the brooks brim
gather idle oysters from green shoals,
but let the quicksilver mackerel swim
let the quicksilver mackerel swim
where the black wave topples down
hide, hide, in the warm port
lest the water drag you to drown

juvenilia
yet astronomic fountains
exit from the heart
tempo of strict ocean
metronomes the blood,
yet ordered lunar motion
proceeds from private flood
drama of each season
plots doom from above,
yet all angelic reason
moves to our minor love

my love for you is more
athletic than a verb,
agile as a star
the tents of sun absorb
treading circus tightropes
of each syllable,
the brazen jackanapes
would fracture if he fell
acrobat of space,
the daring adjective
plunges for a phrase
describing arcs of love
nimble as a noun,
he catapults in air
a planetary swoon
could climax his career,
but adroit conjunction
eloquently shall
link to his lyric action
a periodic goal
juvenilia

if you dissect a bird
to diagram the tongue,
youll cut the chord
articulating song
if you flay a beast
to marvel at the mane,
youll wreck the rest
from which the fur began
if you assault a fish
to analyse the fin,
your hands will crush
the generating bone
if you pluck out my heart
to find what makes it move,
youll halt the clock
that syncopates our love
lament
a villanelle
the sting of bees took away my father
who walked in a swarming shroud of wings
and scorned the tick of the falling weather
lightning licked in a yellow lather
but missed the mark with snaking fangs
the sting of bees took away my father
trouncing the sea like a raging bather,
he rode the flood in a pride of prongs
and scorned the tick of the falling weather
a scowl of sun struck down my mother,
tolling her grave with golden gongs,
but the sting of bees took away my father
he counted the guns of god a bother,
laughed at the ambush of angels tongues,
and scorned the tick of the falling weather
juvenilia
o ransack the four winds and find another
man who can mangle the grin of kings
the sting of bees took away my father
who scorned the tick of the falling weather
doomsday
the idiot bird leaps out and drunken leans
atop the broken universal clock
the hour is crowed in lunatic thirteens
our painted stages fall apart by scenes
while all the actors halt in mortal shock
the idiot bird leaps out and drunken leans
streets crack through in havocsplit ravines
as the doomstruck city crumbles block by block
the hour is crowed in lunatic thirteens
fractured glass flies down in smithereens
our lucky relics have been put in hock
the idiot bird leaps out and drunken leans
gods monkey wrench has blasted all machines
we never thought to hear the holy cock
the hour is crowed in lunatic thirteens
too late to ask if end was worth the means,
too late to calculate the toppling stock
the idiot bird leaps out and drunken leans,
the hour is crowed in lunatic thirteens
moonsong at morning
o moon of illusion,
enchanting men
with tinsel vision
along the vein,
cocks crow up a rival
to mock your face
juvenilia
and eclipse that oval
which conjured us
to leave our reason
and come to this
fabled horizon
of caprice
dawn shall dissever
your silver veil
which let lover think lover
beautiful
the light of logic
will show us that
all moonstruck magic
is dissolute
no sweet disguises
withstand that stare
whose candor exposes
loves paling sphere
in gardens of squalor
the sleepers wake
as their golden jailer
turns the rack
each sacred body
night yielded up
is mangled by study
of microscope
facts have blasted
the angels frame
and stern truth twisted
the radiant limb
reflect in terror
the scorching sun
dive at your mirror
and drown within
juvenilia
doom of exiles
now we, returning from the vaulted domes
of our colossal sleep, come home to find
a tall metropolis of catacombs
erected down the gangways of our mind
green alleys where we reveled have become
the infernal haunt of demon dangers
both seraph song and violins are dumb
each clock tick consecrates the death of strangers
backward we traveled to reclaim the day
before we fell, like icarus, undone
all we find are altars in decay
and profane words scrawled black across the sun
still, stubbornly we try to crack the nut
in which the riddle of our race is shut

tell me quick, darling, tell me now
an odd disease has hit our holy cow,
no milk or honey fills the empty can
the enormous mortgage must be paid somehow
if youve a plot to halt the lethal flow
of weevil tribe and locust caravan
tell me quick, darling, tell me now
our creditor advances with a bow
to cast lock, stock and barrel under ban
the enormous mortgage must be paid somehow
if you can think of means to mend the vow
we broke the minute that the world began
tell me quick, darling, tell me now

weve squandered all the banker will allow
and mislaid every vital talisman
the enormous mortgage must be paid somehow

admonitions
oh never try to knock on rotten wood
or play another card game when youve won
never try to know more than you should
the magic golden apples all look good
although the wicked witch has poisoned one
oh never try to knock on rotten woi
from here the moon seems smooth as angelfood,
from here you cant see spots upon the sun
never try to know more than you should
the suave dissembling cobra wears a hood
and swaggers like a proper gentleman
oh never try to knock on rotten wood
while angels wear a wakeful attitude
disguise beguiles and mortal mischiefs done
never try to know more than you should
for deadly secrets strike when understood
and lucky stars all exit on the run
never try to knock on rotten wood,
never try to know more than you should
never try to trick me with a kiss
never try to trick me with a kiss
pretending that the birds are here to stay
the dying man will scoff in scorn at this
a stone can masquerade where no heart is
and virgins rise where lustful venus lay
never try to trick me with a kiss
juvenilia
our noble doctor claims the pain is his,
while stricken patients let him have his say
the dying man will scoff in scorn at this
each virile bachelor dreads paralysis,
the old maid in the gable cries all day
never try to trick me with a kiss
the suave eternal serpents promise bliss
to mortal children longing to be gay
the dying man will scoff in scorn at this
sooner or later something goes amiss
the singing birds pack up and fly away
so never try to trick me with a kiss
the dying man will scoff in scorn at this
the dead
revolving in oval loops of solar speed,
couched in cauls of clay as in holy robes,
dead men render love and war no heed,
lulled in the ample womb of the fulltilt globe
no spiritual caesars are these dead
they want no proud paternal kingdom come
and when at last they blunder into bed
worldwrecked, they seek only oblivion
rolled round with goodly loam and cradled deep,
these bone shanks will not wake immaculate
to trumpettoppling dawn of doomstruck day
they loll forever in colossal sleep
nor can gods stern, shocked angels cry them up
from their fond, final, infamous decay
danse macabre
down among strict roots and rocks,
eclipsed beneath blind lid of land
goes the grassembroidered box
juvenilia
arranged in sheets of ice, the fond
skeleton still craves to have
fever from the world behind
hands reach back to relics of
nippled moons, extinct and cold,
frozen in designs of love
at twelve, each skull is aureoled
with recollections ticking thorns
winding up the raveled mold
needles nag like unicorns,
assault a sleeping virgins shroud
till her stubborn body burns
lured by brigands in the blood,
shanks of bone now resurrect,
inveigled to forsake the sod
eloping from their slabs, abstract
couples court by milk of moon
sheer silver blurs their phantom act
luminous, the town of stone
anticipates the warning sound
of cockcrow crying up the dawn
with kiss of cinders, ghosts descend,
compelled to deadlock underground
circus in three rings
in the circus tent of a hurricane
designed by a drunken god
my extravagant heart blows up again
in a rampage of champagnecolored rain
and the fragments whir like a weather vane
while the angels all applaud
daring as death and debonair
i invade my lions den
a rose of jeopardy flames in my hair
juvenilia
yet i flourish my whip with a fatal flair
defending my perilous wounds with a chair
while the gnawings of love begin
mocking as mephistopheles,
eclipsed by magicians disguise,
my demon of doom tilts on a trapeze,
winged rabbits revolving about his knees,
only to vanish with devilish ease
in a smoke that sears my eyes
prologue to spring
the winter landscape hangs in balance now,
transfixed by glare of blue from gorgons eye
the skaters freeze within a stone tableau
air alters into glass and the whole sky
grows brittle as a tilted china bowl
hill and valley stiffen row on row
each fallen leaf is trapped by spell of steel,
crimped like fern in the quartz atmosphere
repose of sculpture holds the country still
what countermagic can undo the snare
which has stopped the season in its tracks
and suspended all that might occur?
locked in crystal caskets are the lakes,
yet as we wonder what can come of ice
greensinging birds explode from all the rocks
song for a revolutionary love
o throw it away, throw it all away on the wind
first let the heavenly foliage go,
and page by pride the good books blow
scatter smug angels with your hand
juvenilia
undo the doings of the fathering age
chuck the broken acropolis out,
fling the seven wonders after that
with struts and props of the holy stage
disrupt the calendars next send the duteous
packing without a compass or scale
to chart the measure of fortunes wheel
let nothing be left to swaddle us
unravel antique samplers, unwind the clocks,
till unruly children stream down the sky
and old maids on impromptu petticoats fly
with begonia and building blocks
now empty boxes of the hoodwinked dead
upon the pouring air until
god hears from his great sunstruck hell
the chittering crackpots that he made
then hurl the bare world like a bluegreen ball
back into the holocaust
to burn away the humbug rust
and again together begin it all
sonnet to satan
in darkroom of your eye the mojnly mind
somersaults to counterfeit eclipse
bright angels black out over logics land
under shutter of their handicaps
commanding that corkscrew comet jet forth ink
to pitch the white world down in swiveling flood,
you overcast all orders noonday rank
and turn gods radiant photograph to shade
steepling snake in that contrary light
invades the dilate lens of genesis
to print your flaming image in birthspot
with characters no cockcrow can deface
o maker of proud planets negative,
obscure the scalding sun till no clocks move
juvenilia
a sorcerer bids farewell to seem
im through with this grand lookingglass hotel
where adjectives play croquet with flamingo nouns
methinks i shall absent me for a while
from rhetoric of these rococo queens
item chuck out royal rigmarole of props
and auction off each rare whiterabbit verb
send my muse alice packing with gaudy scraps
of mushroom simile and gryphon garb
my native sleightofhand is wearing out
mad hatters hat yields no new metaphor,
the jabberwock will not translate his songs
its time to vanish like the cheshire cat
alone to that authentic island where
cabbages are cabbages kings kings
midsummer mobile
begin by dipping your brush into clear light
then syncopate a sky of dufyblue
with tilted spars of sloops revolved by white
gulls in a feathered fugue of wings outdo
seurat fleck schooner flanks with sun and set
a tremolo of turquoise quivering in
the tessellated wave now nimbly let
a tinsel pizzicato on fish fin
be plucked from caves of dappled amber where
a mermaid odalisque lolls at her ease
with orange scallops tangled in wet hair,
fresh from the mellow palette of matisse
suspend this day, so singularly designed,
like a rare calder mobile in your mind
juvenilia
on looking into the eyes of a demon lover
here are two pupils
whose moons of black
transform to cripples
all who look
each lovely lady
who peers inside
takes on the body
of a toad
within these mirrors
the world inverts
the fond admirers
burning darts
turn back to injure
the thrusting hand
and inflame to danger
the scarlet wound
i sought my image
in the scorching glass,
for what fire could damage
a witchs face ?
so i stared in that furnace
where beauties char
but found radiant venus
reflected there
insolent storm strikes at the skull
insolent storm strikes at the skull,
assaults the sleeping citadel,
knocking the warden to his knees
in impotence, to sue for peace,
while wantonly amused by this,
wind wakes the whole metropolis
skeptic cyclones try the bone
of strict and sacred skeleton
polemic gales prove point by point
juvenilia
how flesh cleaves fast to frozen joint,
and a hurricane headache rocks
the temples of the orthodox
abracadabra of the rain
drowns noahs prayers with distain,
drives priest and prostitute in doorways,
bereft of moses and of mores
no ancient blueprint builds an ark
to navigate this final dark
river floods transcend the level
demarcating good from evil,
and casuist arguments run riot
inundating edens quiet
all absolutes that angels give
flounder in the relative
lightning conjures gods globe off its
orbit neither law nor prophets
can rectify truant intent
to doublecross the firmament
now earth rejects communication
with heavens autocratic station,
and violates celestial custom
by seceding from the solar system
scintillant irony inspires
independent rebel fires
till the announcers voice is lost
in heresies of holocaust
denouement
the telegram says you have gone away
and left our bankrupt circus on its own
there is nothing more for me to say
the maestro gives the singing birds their pay
and they buy tickets for the tropic zone
the telegram says you have gone away
the clever woolly dogs have had their day
they shoot the dice for one remaining bone
there is nothing more for me to say
juvenilia
the lion and the tigers turn to clay
and jumbo sadly trumpets into stone
the telegram says you have gone away
the morbid cobras wits have run astray
he rents his poisons out by telephone
there is nothing more for me to say
the colored tents all topple in the bay
the magic sawdust writes address unknown
the telegram says you have gone away
there is nothing more for me to say
two lovers and a beachcomber by the real sea
cold and final, the imagination
shuts down its fabled summer house
blue views are boarded up our sweet vacation
dwindles in the hourglass
thoughts that found a maze of mermaid hair
tangling in the tides green fall
now fold their wings like bats and disappear
into the attic of the skull
we are not what we might be what we are
outlaws all extrapolation
beyond the interval of now and here
white whales are gone with the white ocean
a lone beachcomber squats among the wrack
of kaleidoscopic shells
probing fractured venus with a stick
under a tent of taunting gulls
no seachange decks the sunken shank of bone
that chuckles in backtrack of the wave
though the mind like an oyster labors on and on,
a grain of sand is all we have
water will run by rule the actual sun
will scrupulously rise and set
no little man lives in the exacting moon
and that is that, is that, is that
juvenilia
black pine tree in an orange light
tell me what you see in it
the pine tree like a rorschachblot
black against the orange light
plant an orange pumpkin patch
which at twelve will quaintly hatch
nine black mice with ebon coach,
or walk into the orange and make
a devils cataract of black
obscure gods eye with corkscrew fleck
put orange mistress half in sun,
half in shade, until her skin
tattoos black leaves on tangerine
read black magic or holy book
or lyric of love in the orange and black
till dark is conquered by orange cock,
but more pragmatic than all of this,
say how crafty the painter was
to make orange and black ambiguous
terminal
riding home from credulous blue domes,
the dreamer reins his waking appetite
in panic at the crop of catacombs
sprung up like plague of toadstools overnight
refectories where he reveled have become
the hostelry of worms, rapacious blades
who weave within the skeletons white womb
a caviare decay of rich brocades
turning the tables of this grave gourmet,
the fiendish butler saunters in and serves
for feast the sweetest meat of hells chef doeuvres
his own pale bride upon a flaming tray
parsleyed with elegies, she lies in state
waiting for his grace to consecrate
juvenilia
love is a parallax
perspective betrays with its dichotomy
train tracks always meet, not here, but only
in the impossible minds eye
horizons beat a retreat as we embark
on sophist seas to overtake that mark
where wave pretends to drench real sky
well then, if we agree, it is not odd
that one mans devil is anothers god
or that the solar spectrum is
a multitude of shaded grays suspense
on the quicksands of ambivalence
is our lifes whole nemesis
so we could rave on, darling, you and i,
until the stars tick out a lullaby
about each cosmic pro and con
nothing changes, for all the blazing of
our drastic jargon, but clock hands that move
implacably from twelve to one
we raise our arguments like sitting ducks
to knock them down with logic or with luck
and contradict ourselves for fun
the waitress holds our coats and we put on
the raw wind like a scarf love is a faun
who insists his playmates run
now you, my intellectual leprechaun,
would have me swallow the entire sun
like an enormous oyster, down
the ocean in one gulp you say a mark
of comet harakiri through the dark
should inflame the sleeping town
so kiss the drunks upon the curb and dames
in dubious doorways forget their monday names,
caper with candles in their heads
the leaves applaud, and santa claus flies in
scattering candy from a zeppelin,
playing his prodigal charades
juvenilia
the moon leans down to look the tilting fish
in the rare river wink and laugh we lavish
blessings right and left and cry
hello, and then hello again in deaf
churchyard ears until the starlit stiff
graves all carol in reply
now kiss again till our strict father leans
to call for curtain on our thousand scenes
brazen actors mock at him,
multiply pink harlequins and sing
in gay ventriloquy from wing to wing
while footlights flare and houselights dim
tell now, we taunt, where black or white begins
and separate the flutes from violins
the algebra of absolutes
explodes in a kaleidoscope of shapes
that jar, while each polemic jackanapes
joins his enemies recruits
the paradox is that the plays the thing
though prima donna pouts and critic stings,
there burns throughout the line of words,
the cultivated act, a fierce brief fusion
which dreamers call real, and realists, illusion
an insight like the flight of birds
arrows that lacerate the sky, while knowing
the secret of their ecstasys in going
some day, moving, one will drop,
and, dropping, die, to trace a wound that heals
only to reopen as flesh congeals
cycling phoenix never stops
so we shall walk barefoot on walnut shells
of withered worlds, and stamp out puny hells
and heavens till the spirits squeak
surrender to build our bed as high as jacks
bold beanstalk lie and love till sharp scythe hacks
away our rationed days and weeks
then let the blue tent topple, stars rain down,
and god or void appall us till we drown
in our own tears today we start
juvenilia
to pay the piper with each breath, yet love
knows not of death nor calculus above
the simple sum of heart plus heart
aerialist
each night, this adroit young lady
lies among sheets
shredded fine as snowflakes
until dream takes her body
from bed to strict tryouts
in tightrope acrobatics
nightly she balances
catclever on perilous wire
in a gigantic hall,
footing her delicate dances
t o whipcrack and roar
which speak her maestros will
gilded, coming correct
across that sultry air,
she steps, halts, hung
in dead center of her act
as great weights drop all about her
and commence to swing
lessoned thus, the girl
parries the lunge and menace
of every pendulum
by deft duck and twirl
she draws applause bright harness
bites keen into each brave limb
then, this tough stint done, she curtsies
and serenely plummets down
to traverse glass floor
and get safe home but, turning with trained eyes,
tigertamer and grinning clown
squat, bowling black balls at her
tall trucks roll in
with a thunder like lions all aims
and lumbering moves
juvenilia
to trap this outrageous nimble queen
and shatter to atoms
her nine so slippery lives
sighting the stratagem
of black weight, black ball, black truck,
with a last artful dodge she leaps
through hoop of that hazardous dream
to sit up stark awake
as the loud alarmclock stops
now as penalty for her skill,
by day she must walk in dread
steel gauntlets of traffic, terrorstruck
lest, out of spite, the whole
elaborate scaffold of sky overhead
fall racketing finale on her luck
morning in the hospital solarium
sunlight strikes a glass of grapefruit juice,
flaring green through philodendron leaves
in this surrealistic house
of pink and beige, impeccable bamboo,
patronized by convalescent wives
heat shadows waver noiseless in
bright windowsquares until the women seem
to float like dreamfish in the languid limbo
of an undulant aquarium
morning another day, and talk
taxis indolent on whispered wheels
the starched white coat, the cats paw walk,
herald distraction a flock of pastel pills,
turquoise, rose, sierra mauve needles
that sting no more than love a room where time
ticks tempo to the casual climb
of mercury in graded tubes, where ills
slowly concede to sun and serum
like petulant parakeets corked up in cages
of intricate spunglass routine,
the women wait, fluttering, turning pages
of magazines in elegant ennui,
juvenilia
hoping for some incredible dark man
to assault the scene and make some
gaudy miracle occur, to come
and like a burglar steal their fancy
at noon, anemic husbands visit them
the princess and the goblins
o
from fabrication springs the spiral stair
up which the wakeful princess climbs to find
the source of blanching light that conjured her
to leave her bed of fever and ascend
a visionary ladder toward the moon
whose holy blue anoints her injured hand
with finger bandaged where the waspish pin
flew from the intricate embroidery
and stung according to the witchs plan,
she mounts through malice of the needles eye,
trailing her scrupulously simple gown
along bright asterisks by milky way
colonnades of angels nod her in
where ancient, infinite, and beautiful,
her legendary godmother leans down,
spinning a single stubborn thread of wool
which all the artful wizards cannot crimp
to keep the young girl from her crowning goal
initiated by the lunar lamp,
kindling her within a steepled flame,
the princess hears the thunder and the pomp
of squadrons underground abducting him
who is the destination of the cord
now bound around her wrist till she redeem
this miners boy from goblin bodyguard
juvenilia

guided only by the tug and twitch
of that mercurial strand, the girl goes down
the darkening stair, undoes the palace latch
and slips unseen past watchmen on the lawn
dozing around their silvered sentry box
across the frosted grass she marks the sheen
of thread conducting her to the worn tracks
made by miners up the mountainside
among the jagged mazes of the rocks
laboring on the tilt of that steep grade
behind which the declining moon has set,
she recalls queer stories her nurse read
about a goblin raid on miners hut
because new excavations came too near
the chambers where their fiendish queen would sit
hearing a weird cackle from afar,
she clutches at the talismanic cord
and confronts a cairn of iron ore
suddenly a brazen song is heard
from the pragmatic boy confined within,
gaily cursing the whole goblin horde
inviolate in the circle of that skein,
looping like faith about her bleeding feet,
the princess frees the miner, stone by stone,
and leads him home to be her chosen knight

the princess coaxes the incredulous boy
through candid kitchens in the rising sun
to seek the staircase by the glare of day
hand in hand, they scale meridian,
clambering up the creaking heights of heat
until she hears the twittering machine
juvenilia
which quaintly wove the fabric of her fate
behind the zodiac on attic door
with abracadabra from the alphabet
pointing toward the spindles cryptic whir,
she tells the greenhorn miner to bow down
and honor the great goddess of the air
suspended aloft within her planetshine
laughing aloud, the dazzled boy demands
why he should kneel before a silly scene
where pigeons promenade the gableends
and coo quadrilles about the blighted core
in a batch of raveled apple rinds
at his words, the indignant godmother
vanishes in a labyrinth of hay
while sunlight winds its yarn upon the floor
o never again will the extravagant straw
knit up a gilded fable for the child
who weeps before the desolate tableau
of clockwork that makes the royal blood run cold
touchandgo
sing praise for statuary
for those anchored attitudes
and staunch stone eyes that stare
through lichenlid and passing birdfoot
at some steadfast mark
beyond the inconstant green
gallop and flick of light
in this precarious park
where vivid children twirl
like colored tops through time
nor stop to understand
how all their play is touchandgo
but, go they cry, and the swing
arcs up to the tall tree tip
go and the merrygoround
hauls them round with it
juvenilia
and i, like the children, caught
in the mortal active verb,
let my transient eye break a tear
for each quick, flaring game
of child, leaf and cloud,
while on this same fugue, unmoved,
those stonier eyes look,
safesocketed in rock
temper of time
an ill wind is stalking
while evil stars whir
and all the gold apples
go bad to the core
black birds of omen
now prowl on the bough
with a hiss of disaster
sibyls leaves blow
through closets of copses
tall skeletons walk
nightshade and nettles
tangle the track
in the ramshackle meadow
where kilroy would pass
lurks the sickleshaped shadow
of snake in the grass
approaching his cottage
by crooked detour,
he hears the gruff knocking
of the wolf at the door
his wife and his children
hang riddled with shot,
theres a hex on the cradle
and death in the pot
juvenilia
epitaph in three parts
i
rocking across the lapis lazuli sea
comes a flock of bottle battleships
each with a telegram addressed to me
destroy your mirror and avoid mishaps,
chirps the first live on a silent island
where the water blots out all footsteps
the second sings receive no roving gallant
who seeks to dally in the port till dawn,
for your fate involves a dark assailant
the third cries out as all the ships go down
there is more than one good way to drown
in the air above my island flies
a crowd of shining gulls that plunge to launch
an accurate assault upon the eyes
of the bold sailor falling under drench
and hunger of the surf that plucks the land,
devouring green gardens inch by inch
blood runs in a glissando from the hand
that lifts to consecrate the sunken man
aloft, a lone gull halts upon the wind,
announcing after glutted birds have flown
there is more than one good way to drown

grasshopper goblins with green pointed ears
caper on leafstalk legs across my doorsill,
and mock the jangling rain of splintered stars
my room is a twittering gray box with a wall
there and there and there again, and then
a window which proves the sky sheer rigmarole
juvenilia
that happens to conceal the lid of one
enormous box of gray where god has gone
and hidden all the bright angelic men
a wave of grass engraves upon the stone
there is more than one good way to drown

let us go then, you and i,
when the evening is spread out against the sky
like a patient etherized upon a table
let us go, through certain halfdeserted streets,
the muttering retreats
of restless nights in onenight cheap hotels
and sawdust restaurants with oystershells
streets that follow like a tedious argument
of insidious intent
to lead you to an overwhelming question
oh, do not ask, what is it?
let us go and make our visit
in the room the women come and go
talking of michelangelo
the yellow fog that rubs its back upon the windowpanes,
the yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the windowpanes,
licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,
lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,
let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,
slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,
and seeing that it was a soft october night,
curled once about the house, and fell asleep
and indeed there will be time
for the yellow smoke that slides along the street,
rubbing its back upon the windowpanes
there will be time, there will be time
to prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet
there will be time to murder and create,
and time for all the works and days of hands
that lift and drop a question on your plate
time for you and time for me,
and time yet for a hundred indecisions,
and for a hundred visions and revisions,
before the taking of a toast and tea
in the room the women come and go
talking of michelangelo
and indeed there will be time
to wonder, do i dare? and, do i dare?
time to turn back and descend the stair,
with a bald spot in the middle of my hair
they will say how his hair is growing thin
my morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,
my necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin
they will say but how his arms and legs are thin
do i dare
disturb the universe?
in a minute there is time
for decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse
for i have known them all already, known them all
have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,
i have measured out my life with coffee spoons
i know the voices dying with a dying fall
beneath the music from a farther room
so how should i presume?
and i have known the eyes already, known them all
the eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,
and when i am formulated, sprawling on a pin,
when i am pinned and wriggling on the wall,
then how should i begin
to spit out all the buttends of my days and ways?
and how should i presume?
and i have known the arms already, known them all
arms that are braceleted and white and bare
but in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair
is it perfume from a dress
that makes me so digress?
arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl
and should i then presume?
and how should i begin?
shall i say, i have gone at dusk through narrow streets
and watched the smoke that rises from the pipes
of lonely men in shirtsleeves, leaning out of windows?
i should have been a pair of ragged claws
scuttling across the floors of silent seas

and the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully
smoothed by long fingers,
asleep  tired  or it malingers,
stretched on the floor, here beside you and me
should i, after tea and cakes and ices,
have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?
but though i have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,
though i have seen my head grown slightly bald brought in upon a platter,
i am no prophetand heres no great matter
i have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,
and i have seen the eternal footman hold my coat, and snicker,
and in short, i was afraid
and would it have been worth it, after all,
after the cups, the marmalade, the tea,
among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,
would it have been worth while,
to have bitten off the matter with a smile,
to have squeezed the universe into a ball
to roll it towards some overwhelming question,
to say i am lazarus, come from the dead,
come back to tell you all, i shall tell you all
if one, settling a pillow by her head
should say that is not what i meant at all
that is not it, at all
and would it have been worth it, after all,
would it have been worth while,
after the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,
after the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor
and this, and so much more?
it is impossible to say just what i mean
but as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen
would it have been worth while
if one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,
and turning toward the window, should say
that is not it at all,
that is not what i meant, at all
no i am not prince hamlet, nor was meant to be
am an attendant lord, one that will do
to swell a progress, start a scene or two,
advise the prince no doubt, an easy tool,
deferential, glad to be of use,
politic, cautious, and meticulous
full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse
at times, indeed, almost ridiculous
almost, at times, the fool
i grow old  i grow old
i shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled
shall i part my hair behind? do i dare to eat a peach?
i shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach
i have heard the mermaids singing, each to each
i do not think that they will sing to me
i have seen them riding seaward on the waves
combing the white hair of the waves blown back
when the wind blows the water white and black
we have lingered in the chambers of the sea
by seagirls wreathed with seaweed red and brown
till human voices wake us, and we drown
they are rattling breakfast plates in basement kitchens,
and along the trampled edges of the street
i am aware of the damp souls of housemaids
sprouting despondently at area gates
the brown waves of fog toss up to me
twisted faces from the bottom of the street,
and tear from a passerby with muddy skirts
an aimless smile that hovers in the air
and vanishes along the level of the roofs
twelve oclock
along the reaches of the street
held in a lunar synthesis,
whispering lunar incantations
dissolve the floors of memory
and all its clear relations,
its divisions and precisions,
every street lamp that i pass
beats like a fatalistic drum,
and through the spaces of the dark
midnight shakes the memory
as a madman shakes a dead geranium
halfpast one,
the street lamp sputtered,
the street lamp muttered,
the street lamp said, regard that woman
who hesitates towards you in the light of the door
which opens on her like a grin
you see the border of her dress
is torn and stained with sand,
and you see the corner of her eye
twists like a crooked pin
the memory throws up high and dry
a crowd of twisted things
a twisted branch upon the beach
eaten smooth, and polished
as if the world gave up
the secret of its skeleton,
stiff and white
a broken spring in a factory yard,
rust that clings to the form that the strength has left
hard and curled and ready to snap
halfpast two,
the street lamp said,
remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter,
slips out its tongue
and devours a morsel of rancid butter
so the hand of a child, automatic,
slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along the quay
i could see nothing behind that childs eye
i have seen eyes in the street
trying to peer through lighted shutters,
and a crab one afternoon in a pool,
an old crab with barnacles on his back,
gripped the end of a stick which i held him
halfpast three,
the lamp sputtered,
the lamp muttered in the dark
the lamp hummed
regard the moon,
la lune ne garde aucune rancune,
she winks a feeble eye,
she smiles into corners
she smoothes the hair of the grass
the moon has lost her memory
a washedout smallpox cracks her face,
her hand twists a paper rose,
that smells of dust and old cologne,
she is alone
with all the old nocturnal smells
that cross and cross across her brain
the reminiscence comes
of sunless dry geraniums
and dust in crevices,
smells of chestnuts in the streets,
and female smells in shuttered rooms,
and cigarettes in corridors
and cocktail smells in bars
the lamp said,
four oclock,
here is the number on the door
memory
you have the key,
the little lamp spreads a ring on the stair,
mount
the bed is open the toothbrush hangs on the wall,
put your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for life

apeneck sweeney spreads his knees
letting his arms hang down to laugh,
the zebra stripes along his jaw
swelling to maculate giraffe
the circles of the stormy moon
slide westward toward the river plate,
death and the raven drift above

gloomy orion and the dog
are veiled and hushed the shrunken seas
the person in the spanish cape
tries to sit on sweeneys knees
slips and pulls the table cloth
overturns a coffeecup,
reorganized upon the floor
she yawns and draws a stocking up
the silent man in mocha brown
sprawls at the windowsill and gapes
the waiter brings in oranges
bananas figs and hothouse grapes
the silent vertebrate in brown
contracts and concentrates, withdraws
rachel ne rabinovitch
tears at the grapes with murderous paws
she and the lady in the cape
are suspect, thought to be in league
therefore the man with heavy eyes
declines the gambit, shows fatigue,
leaves the room and reappears
outside the window, leaning in,
branches of wistaria
circumscribe a golden grin
the host with someone indistinct
converses at the door apart,
the nightingales are singing near
the convent of the sacred heart,
and sang within the bloody wood
when agamemnon cried aloud,
and let their liquid droppings fall
to stain the stiff dishonoured shroud
as she laughed i was aware of becoming involved
in her laughter and being part of it, until her
teeth were only accidental stars with a talent
for squaddrill i was drawn in by short gasps,
inhaled at each momentary recovery, lost finally
in the dark caverns of her throat, bruised by
the ripple of unseen muscles an elderly waiter
with trembling hands was hurriedly spreading
a pink and white checked cloth over the rusty
green iron table, saying if the lady and
gentleman wish to take their tea in the garden,
if the lady and gentleman wish to take their
tea in the garden  i decided that if the
shaking of her breasts could be stopped, some of
the fragments of the afternoon might be collected,
and i concentrated my attention with careful
subtlety to this end

susceptible to nervous shock
while the true church can never fail
for it is based upon a rock
the hippos feeble steps may err
in compassing material ends,
while the true church need never stir
to gather in its dividends
the potamus can never reach
the mango on the mangotree
but fruits of pomegranate and peach
refresh the church from over sea
at mating time the hippos voice
betrays inflexions hoarse and odd,
but every week we hear rejoice
the church, at being one with god
the hippopotamuss day
is passed in sleep at night he hunts
god works in a mysterious way
the church can sleep and feed at once
i saw the potamus take wing
ascending from the damp savannas,
and quiring angels round him sing
the praise of god, in loud hosannas
blood of the lamb shall wash him clean
and him shall heavenly arms enfold,
among the saints he shall be seen
performing on a harp of gold
he shall be washed as white as snow,

we are the hollow men
we are the stuffed men
leaning together
headpiece filled with straw alas
our dried voices, when
we whisper together
are quiet and meaningless
as wind in dry grass
or rats feet over broken glass
in our dry cellar
shape without form, shade without colour,
paralysed force, gesture without motion
those who have crossed
with direct eyes, to deaths other kingdom
remember usif at allnot as lost
violent souls, but only
as the hollow men

eyes i dare not meet in dreams
in deaths dream kingdom
these do not appear
there, the eyes are
sunlight on a broken column
there, is a tree swinging
and voices are
in the winds singing
more distant and more solemn
than a fading star
let me be no nearer
in deaths dream kingdom
let me also wear
such deliberate disguises
rats coat, crowskin, crossed staves
in a field
behaving as the wind behaves
no nearer
not that final meeting
in the twilight kingdom
iii
this is the dead land
this is cactus land
here the stone images
are raised, here they receive
the supplication of a dead mans hand
under the twinkle of a fading star
is it like this
in deaths other kingdom
waking alone
at the hour when we are
trembling with tenderness
lips that would kiss
form prayers to broken stone
iv
the eyes are not here
there are no eyes here
in this valley of dying stars
in this hollow valley
this broken jaw of our lost kingdoms
in this last of meeting places
we grope together
and avoid speech
gathered on this beach of the tumid river
sightless, unless
the eyes reappear
as the perpetual star
multifoliate rose
of deaths twilight kingdom
the hope only
of empty men

starting from fishshape paumanok, where i was born,
wellbegotten, and raised by a perfect mother
after roaming many landslover of populous pavements
dweller in mannahatta, city of ships, my city,or on southern savannas
or a soldier camped, or carrying my knapsack and gunor a miner in
california
or rude in my home in dakotahs woods, my diet meat, my drink from the
spring
or withdrawn to muse and meditate in some deep recess,
far from the clank of crowds, intervals passing, rapt and happy
aware of the fresh free giver, the flowing missouriaware of mighty
niagara
aware of the buffalo herds, grazing the plainsthe hirsute and strong
breasted bull
of earths, rocks, fifthmonth flowers, experiencedstars, rain, snow, my
amaze
having studied the mockingbirds tones, and the mountain hawks,
and heard at dusk the unrivalled one, the hermit thrush, from the
swampcedars,
solitary, singing in the west, i strike up for a new world

victory, union, faith, identity, time,
yourself, the present and future lands, the indissoluble compacts, riches,
mystery,
eternal progress, the kosmos, and the modern reports
this, then, is life
here is what has come to the surface after so many throes and convulsions
how curious how real
under foot the divine soilover head the sun
see, revolving, the globe
the ancestorcontinents, away, grouped together
the present and future continents, north and south, with the isthmus
between
see, vast trackless spaces
as in a dream, they change, they swiftly fill
countless masses debouch upon them
they are now covered with the foremost people, arts, institutions, known
see, projected through time,
for me an audience interminable
with firm and regular step they wendthey never stop,
successions of men, americanos, a hundred millions
one generation playing its part, and passing on,
another generation playing its part, and passing on in its turn,
with faces turned sideways or backward towards me, to listen,
with eyes retrospective towards me

americanos conquerors marches humanitarian

for you a programme of chants
chants of the prairies
chants of the longrunning mississippi, and down to the mexican sea
chants of ohio, indiana, illinois, iowa, wisconsin, and minnesota
chants going forth from the centre, from kansas, and thence, equidistant,
shooting in pulses of fire, ceaseless, to vivify all

in the year  of the states,
my tongue, every atom of my blood, formed from this soil, this air,
born here of parents born here, from parents the same, and their parents
the same,
i, now thirtysix years old, in perfect health begin,
hoping to cease not till death
creeds and schools in abeyance,
retiring back a while, sufficed at what they are, but never forgotten
i harbour, for good or badi permit to speak, at every hazard
nature now without check, with original energy

take my leaves, america take them south, and take them north
make welcome for them everywhere, for they are your own offspring
surround them, east and west for they would surround you
and you precedents connect lovingly with them, for they connect lovingly
with you
i conned old times
i sat studying at the feet of the great masters
now, if eligible, o that the great masters might return and study me
in the name of these states, shall i scorn the antique?
why, these are the children of the antique, to justify it

dead poets, philosophs, priests,
martyrs, artists, inventors, governments long since,
languageshapers on other shores,
nations once powerful, now reduced, withdrawn, or desolate,
i dare not proceed till i respectfully credit what you have left, wafted
hither
i have perused itown it is admirable, moving awhile among it
think nothing can ever be greaternothing can ever deserve more than it
deserves
regarding it all intently a long while, then dismissing it,
i stand in my place, with my own day, here
here lands female and male
here the heirship and heiressship of the worldhere the flame of
materials
here spirituality, the translatress, the openlyavowed,
the evertending, the finale of visible forms
the satisfier, after due longwaiting, now advancing,
yes, here comes my mistress, the soul

the soul
for ever and for everlonger than soil is brown and solidlonger than
water ebbs and flows
i will make the poems of materials, for i think they are to be the most
spiritual poems
and i will make the poems of my body and of mortality,
for i think i shall then supply myself with the poems of my soul, and of
immortality
i will make a song for these states, that no one state may under any
circumstances be subjected to another state
and i will make a song that there shall be comity by day and by night
between all the states, and between any two of them
and i will make a song for the ears of the president, full of weapons with
menacing points,
and behind the weapons countless dissatisfied faces
and a song make i, of the one formed out of all
the fanged and glittering one whose head is over all
resolute, warlike one, including and over all
however high the head of any else, that head is over all
i will acknowledge contemporary lands
i will trail the whole geography of the globe, and salute courteously every
city large and small
and employments i will put in my poems, that with you is heroism, upon
land and seaand i will report all heroism from an american point
of view
and sexual organs and acts do you concentrate in mefor i am determined
to tell you with courageous clear voice, to prove you illustrious
i will sing the song of companionship
i will show what alone must finally compact these
i believe these are to found their own ideal of manly love, indicating it
in me
i will therefore let flame from me the burning fires that were threatening
to consume me
i will lift what has too long kept down those smouldering fires
i will give them complete abandonment
i will write the evangelpoem of comrades and of love
for who but i should understand love, with all its sorrow and joy?
and who but i should be the poet of comrades?

i am the credulous man of qualities, ages, races
i advance from the people en masse in their own spirit
here is what sings unrestricted faith
omnes omnes let others ignore what they may
i make the poem of evil alsoi commemorate that part also
i am myself just as much evil as good, and my nation isand i say there is
in fact no evil,
or if there is, i say it is just as important to you, to the land, or to
me, as anything else
i too, following many, and followed by many, inaugurate a religioni too
go to the wars
it may be i am destined to utter the loudest cries thereof, the winners
pealing shouts
who knows? they may rise from me yet, and soar above everything
each is not for its own sake
i say the whole earth, and all the stars in the sky, are for religions
sake
i say no man has ever yet been half devout enough
none has ever yet adored or worshipped half enough
none has begun to think how divine he himself is, and how certain the
future is
i say that the real and permanent grandeur of these states must be their
religion
otherwise there is no real and permanent grandeur
nor character, nor life worthy the name, without religion
nor land, nor man or woman, without religion

what are you doing, young man?
are you so earnestso given up to literature, science, art, amours?
these ostensible realities, politics, points?
your ambition or business, whatever it may be?
it is wellagainst such i say not a wordi am their poet also
but behold such swiftly subsideburnt up for religions sake
for not all matter is fuel to heat, impalpable flame, the essential life of
the earth,
any more than such are to religion

what do you seek, so pensive and silent?
what do you need, camerado?
dear son do you think it is love?
listen, dear sonlisten, america, daughter or son
it is a painful thing to love a man or woman to excessand yet it
satisfiesit is great
but there is something else very greatit makes the whole coincide
it, magnificent, beyond materials, with continuous hands, sweeps and
provides for all

know you to drop in the earth the germs of a greater religion,
the following chants, each for its kind, i sing
my comrade
for you, to share with me, two greatnessesand a third one, rising
inclusive and more resplendent,
the greatness of love and democracyand the greatness of religion
mlange mine own the unseen and the seen
mysterious ocean where the streams empty
prophetic spirit of materials shifting and flickering around me
living beings, identities, now doubtless near us in the air, that we know
not of
contact daily and hourly that will not release me
these selectingthese, in hints, demanded of me
not he with a daily kiss onward from childhood kissing me
has winded and twisted around me that which holds me to him,
any more than i am held to the heavens, to the spiritual world,
and to the identities of the gods, my lovers, faithful and true,
after what they have done to me, suggesting themes
o such themes equalities
o amazement of things o divine average
o warblings under the sunushered, as now, or at noon, or setting
o strain, musical, flowing through agesnow reaching hither,
i take to your reckless and composite chordsi add to them, and cheerfully
pass them forward

as i have walked in alabama my morning walk,
i have seen where the shebird, the mockingbird, sat on her nest in the
briars, hatching her brood
i have seen the hebird also
i have paused to hear him, near at hand, inflating his throat, and joyfully
singing
and while i paused, it came to me that what he really sang for was not
there only,
nor for his mate nor himself only, nor all sent back by the echoes
but subtle, clandestine, away beyond,
a charge transmitted, and gift occult, for those being born

democracy
near at hand to you a throat is now inflating itself and joyfully singing
ma femme
for the brood beyond us and of us,
for those who belong here, and those to come,
i, exultant, to be ready for them, will now shake out carols stronger and
haughtier than have ever yet been heard upon earth
i will make the songs of passion, to give them their way,
and your songs, outlawed offendersfor i scan you with kindred eyes, and
carry you with me the same as any
i will make the true poem of riches,
to earn for the body and the mind whatever adheres, and goes forward, and
is not dropped by death
i will effuse egotism, and show it underlying alland i will be the bard
of personality
and i will show of male and female that either is but the equal of the
other
and i will show that there is no imperfection in the presentand can be
none in the future
and i will show that, whatever happens to anybody, it may be turned to
beautiful resultsand i will show that nothing can happen more beautiful
than death
and i will thread a thread through my poems that time and events are
compact,
and that all the things of the universe are perfect miracles, each as
profound as any
i will not make poems with reference to parts
but i will make leaves, poems, poemets, songs, says, thoughts, with
reference to ensemble
and i will not sing with reference to a day, but with reference to all
days
and i will not make a poem, nor the least part of a poem, but has reference
to the soul
because, having looked at the objects of the universe, i find there is no
one, nor any particle of one, but has reference to the soul

was somebody asking to see the soul?
see your own shape and countenancepersons, substances, beasts, the
trees, the running rivers, the rocks and sands
all hold spiritual joys, and afterwards loosen them
how can the real body ever die, and be buried?
of your real body, and any mans or womans real body,
item for item, it will elude the hands of the corpsecleaners, and pass to
fitting spheres,
carrying what has accrued to it from the moment of birth to the moment of
death
not the types set up by the printer return their impression, the meaning,
the main concern,
any more than a mans substance and life, or a womans substance and life,
return in the body and the soul,
indifferently before death and after death
behold the body includes and is the meaning, the main concernand
includes and is the soul
whoever you are how superb and how divine is your body, or any part of it

whoever you are to you endless announcements

it is the life of one man or one woman today, the average man of today
it is languages, social customs, literatures, arts
it is the broad show of artificial things, ships, machinery, politics,
creeds, modern improvements, and the interchange of nations,
all for the average man of today
years of the unperformed
years of the unperformed your horizon risesi see it part away for more
august dramas
i see not america onlyi see not only libertys nation but other nations
embattling
i see tremendous entrances and exitsi see new combinationsi see the
solidarity of races
i see that force advancing with irresistible power on the worlds stage
have the old forces played their parts? are the acts suitable to them
closed?
i see freedom, completely armed, and victorious, and very haughty, with law
by her side, both issuing forth against the idea of caste
what historic denouements are these we so rapidly approach?
i see men marching and countermarching by swift millions
i see the frontiers and boundaries of the old aristocracies broken
i see the landmarks of european kings removed
i see this day the people beginning their landmarks, all others give way
never were such sharp questions asked as this day
never was average man, his soul, more energetic, more like a god
lo how he urges and urges, leaving the masses no rest
his daring foot is on land and sea everywherehe colonises the pacific,
the archipelagoes
with the steamship, the electric telegraph, the newspaper, the wholesale
engines of war,
with these, and the worldspreading factories, he interlinks all geography,
all lands
what whispers are these, o lands, running ahead of you, passing under the
seas?
are all nations communing? is there going to be but one heart to the globe?
is humanity forming en masse?for lo tyrants tremble, crowns grow dim
the earth, restive, confronts a new era, perhaps a general divine war
no one knows what will happen nextsuch portents fill the days and nights
years prophetical the space ahead as i walk, as i vainly try to pierce it,
is full of phantoms
unborn deeds, things soon to be, project their shapes around me
this incredible rush and heatthis strange ecstatic fever of dreams, o
years
your dreams, o years, how they penetrate through me i know not whether i
sleep or wake
the performed america and europe grow dim, retiring in shadow behind me,
the unperformed, more gigantic than ever, advance, advance upon me
flux
of these years i sing,
how they pass through convulsed pains, as through parturitions
how america illustrates birth, gigantic youth, the promise, the sure
fulfilment, despite of peopleillustrates evil as well as good
how many hold despairingly yet to the models departed, caste, myths,
obedience, compulsion, and to infidelity
how few see the arrived models, the athletes, the statesor see freedom or
spiritualityor hold any faith in results
but i see the athletesand i see the results glorious and inevitableand
they again leading to other results
how the great cities appearhow the democratic masses, turbulent, wilful,
as i love them,
how the whirl, the contest, the wrestle of evil with good, the sounding and
resounding, keep on and on
how society waits unformed, and is between things ended and things begun
how america is the continent of glories, and of the triumph of freedom, and
of the democracies, and of the fruits of society, and of all that
is begun
and how the states are complete in themselvesand how all triumphs and
glories are complete in themselves, to lead onward,
and how these of mine, and of the states, will in their turn be convulsed,
and serve other parturitions and transitions
and how all people, sights, combinations, the democratic masses, too,
serveand how every fact serves,
and how now, or at any time, each serves the exquisite transition of death
to working men

come closer to me
push close, my lovers, and take the best i possess
yield closer and closer, and give me the best you possess
this is unfinished business with mehow is it with you?
i was chilled with the cold types, cylinder, wet paper between us
male and female
i pass so poorly with paper and types, i must pass with the contact of
bodies and souls
american masses
i do not thank you for liking me as i am, and liking the touch of mei
know that it is good for you to do so

this is the poem of occupations
in the labour of engines and trades, and the labour of fields, i find the
developments,
and find the eternal meanings
workmen and workwomen
were all educations, practical and ornamental, well displayed out of me,
what would it amount to?
were i as the head teacher, charitable proprietor, wise statesman, what
would it amount to?
were i to you as the boss employing and paying you, would that satisfy you?
the learned, virtuous, benevolent, and the usual terms
a man like me, and never the usual terms
neither a servant nor a master am i
i take no sooner a large price than a small pricei will have my own,
whoever enjoys me
i will be even with you, and you shall be even with me
if you stand at work in a shop, i stand as nigh as the nighest in the same
shop
if you bestow gifts on your brother or dearest friend, i demand as good as
your brother or dearest friend
if your lover, husband, wife, is welcome by day or night, i must be
personally as welcome
if you become degraded, criminal, ill, then i become so for your sake
if you remember your foolish and outlawed deeds, do you think i cannot
remember my own foolish and outlawed deeds?
if you carouse at the table, i carouse at the opposite side of the table
if you meet some stranger in the streets, and love him or herwhy i often
meet strangers in the street, and love them
why, what have you thought of yourself?
is it you then that thought yourself less?
is it you that thought the president greater than you?
or the rich better off than you? or the educated wiser than you?
because you are greasy or pimpled, or that you was once drunk, or a thief,
or diseased, or rheumatic, or a prostitute, or are so now
or from frivolity or impotence, or that you are no scholar, and never saw
your name in print,
do you give in that you are any less immortal?

souls of men and women it is not you i call unseen, unheard, untouchable
and untouching
it is not you i go argue pro and con about, and to settle whether you are
alive or no
i own publicly who you are, if nobody else owns
grown, halfgrown, and babe, of this country and every country, indoors and
outdoors, one just as much as the other, i see,
and all else behind or through them
the wifeand she is not one jot less than the husband
the daughterand she is just as good as the son
the motherand she is every bit as much as the father
offspring of ignorant and poor, boys apprenticed to trades,
young fellows working on farms, and old fellows working on farms,
sailormen, merchantmen, coasters, immigrants,
all these i seebut nigher and farther the same i see
none shall escape me, and none shall wish to escape me
i bring what you much need, yet always have,
not money, amours, dress, eating, but as good
i send no agent or medium, offer no representative of value, but offer the
value itself
there is something that comes home to one now and perpetually
it is not what is printed, preached, discussedit eludes discussion and
print
it is not to be put in a bookit is not in this book
it is for you, whoever you areit is no farther from you than your hearing
and sight are from you
it is hinted by nearest, commonest, readiestit is ever provoked by them
you may read in many languages, yet read nothing about it
you may read the presidents message, and read nothing about it there
nothing in the reports from the state department or treasury department, or
in the daily papers or the weekly papers,
or in the census or revenue returns, prices current, or any accounts of
stock

the sun and stars that float in the open air
the appleshaped earth, and we upon itsurely the drift of them is
something grand
i do not know what it is, except that it is grand, and that it is
happiness,
and that the enclosing purport of us here is not a speculation, or bonmot,
or reconnoissance,
and that it is not something which by luck may turn out well for us, and
without luck must be a failure for us,
and not something which may yet be retracted in a certain contingency
the light and shade, the curious sense of body and identity, the greed that
with perfect complaisance devours all things, the endless pride and
outstretching of man, unspeakable joys and sorrows,
the wonder every one sees in every one else he sees, and the wonders that
fill each minute of time for ever,
what have you reckoned them for, camerado?
have you reckoned them for a trade, or farmwork? or for the profits of a
store?
or to achieve yourself a position? or to fill a gentlemans leisure, or a
ladys leisure?
have you reckoned the landscape took substance and form that it might be
painted in a picture?
or men and women that they might be written of, and songs sung?
or the attraction of gravity, and the great laws and harmonious
combinations, and the fluids of the air, as subjects for the
savans?
or the brown land and the blue sea for maps and charts?
or the stars to be put in constellations and named fancy names?
or that the growth of seeds is for agricultural tables, or agriculture
itself?
old institutionsthese arts, libraries, legends, collections, and the
practice handed along in manufactureswill we rate them so high?
will we rate our cash and business high?i have no objection
i rate them as high as the highestthen a child born of a woman and man i
rate beyond all rate
we thought our union grand, and our constitution grand
i do not say they are not grand and good, for they are
i am this day just as much in love with them as you
then i am in love with you, and with all my fellows upon the earth
we consider bibles and religions divinei do not say they are not divine
i say they have all grown out of you, and may grow out of you still
it is not they who give the lifeit is you who give the life
leaves are not more shed from the trees, or trees from the earth, than they
are shed out of you

when the psalm sings, instead of the singer
when the script preaches, instead of the preacher
when the pulpit descends and goes, instead of the carver that carved the
supporting desk
when i can touch the body of books, by night or by day, and when they touch
my body back again
when a university course convinces, like a slumbering woman and child
convince
when the minted gold in the vault smiles like the nightwatchmans
daughter
when warrantee deeds loafe in chairs opposite, and are my friendly
companions
i intend to reach them my hand, and make as much of them as i do of men and
women like you
the sum of all known reverence i add up in you, whoever you are
the president is there in the white house for youit is not you who are
here for him
the secretaries act in their bureaus for younot you here for them
the congress convenes every twelfth month for you
laws, courts, the forming of states, the charters of cities, the going and
coming of commerce and mails, are all for you
list close, my scholars dear
all doctrines, all politics and civilisation, exsurge from you
all sculpture and monuments, and anything inscribed anywhere, are tallied
in you
the gist of histories and statistics, as far back as the records reach, is
in you this hour, and myths and tales the same
if you were not breathing and walking here, where would they all be?
the most renowned poems would be ashes, orations and plays would be
vacuums
all architecture is what you do to it when you look upon it
did you think it was in the white or grey stone? or the lines of the arches
and cornices?
all music is what awakes from you, when you are reminded by the
instruments
it is not the violins and the cornetsit is not the oboe nor the beating
drums, nor the score of the baritone singer singing his sweet
romanzanor that of the mens chorus, nor that of the womens
chorus,
it is nearer and farther than they

will the whole come back then?
can each see signs of the best by a look in the lookingglass? is there
nothing greater or more?
does all sit there with you, with the mystic, unseen soul?
strange and hard that paradox true i give
objects gross and the unseen soul are one

song of the broadaxe

weapon, shapely, naked, wan
head from the mothers bowels drawn
wooded flesh and metal bone limb only one, and lip only one
greyblue leaf by redheat grown helve produced from a little seed sown
resting the grass amid and upon,
to be leaned, and to lean on

fingers of the organist skipping staccato over the keys of the great organ

welcome are all earths lands, each for its kind
welcome are lands of pine and oak
welcome are lands of the lemon and fig
welcome are lands of gold
welcome are lands of wheat and maizewelcome those of the grape
welcome are lands of sugar and rice
welcome are cottonlandswelcome those of the white potato and sweet
potato
welcome are mountains, flats, sands, forests, prairies
welcome the rich borders of rivers, tablelands, openings,
welcome the measureless grazinglandswelcome the teeming soil of
orchards, flax, honey, hemp
welcome just as much the other more hardfaced lands
lands rich as lands of gold, or wheat and fruit lands
lands of mines, lands of the manly and rugged ores
lands of coal, copper, lead, tin, zinc
lands of iron lands of the make of the axe

the log at the woodpile, the axe supported by it
the sylvan hut, the vine over the doorway, the space cleared for a garden,
the irregular tapping of rain down on the leaves, after the storm is
lulled,
the wailing and moaning at intervals, the thought of the sea,
the thought of ships struck in the storm, and put on their beamends, and
the cutting away of masts
the sentiment of the huge timbers of oldfashioned houses and barns
the remembered print or narrative, the voyage at a venture of men,
families, goods,
the disembarkation, the founding of a new city,
the voyage of those who sought a new england and found itthe outset
anywhere,
the settlements of the arkansas, colorado, ottawa, willamette,
the slow progress, the scant fare, the axe, rifle, saddlebags
the beauty of all adventurous and daring persons,
the beauty of woodboys and woodmen, with their clear untrimmed faces,
the beauty of independence, departure, actions that rely on themselves,
the american contempt for statutes and ceremonies, the boundless impatience
of restraint,
the loose drift of character, the inkling through random types, the
solidification
the butcher in the slaughterhouse, the hands aboard schooners and sloops,
the raftsman, the pioneer,
lumbermen in their winter camp, daybreak in the woods, stripes of snow on
the limbs of trees, the occasional snapping,
the glad clear sound of ones own voice, the merry song, the natural life
of the woods, the strong days work,
the blazing fire at night, the sweet taste of supper, the talk, the bed of
hemlock boughs, and the bearskin
the housebuilder at work in cities or anywhere,
the preparatory jointing, squaring, sawing, mortising,
the hoistup of beams, the push of them in their places, laying them
regular, setting the studs by their tenons in the mortises,
according as they were prepared,
the blows of mallets and hammers, the attitudes of the men, their curved
limbs,
bending, standing, astride the beams, driving in pins, holding on by posts
and braces,
the hooked arm over the plate, the other arm wielding the axe,
the floormen forcing the planks close, to be nailed,
their postures bringing their weapons downward on the bearers,
the echoes resounding through the vacant building
the huge storehouse carried up in the city, well under way,
the six framing men, two in the middle, and two at each end, carefully
bearing on their shoulders a heavy stick for a crossbeam,
the crowded line of masons with trowels in their right hands, rapidly
laying the long sidewall, two hundred feet from front to rear,
the flexible rise and fall of backs, the continual click of the trowels
striking the bricks,
the bricks, one after another, each laid so workmanlike in its place, and
set with a knock of the trowelhandle,
the piles of materials, the mortar on the mortarboards, and the steady
replenishing by the hodmen
sparmakers in the sparyard, the swarming row of wellgrown apprentices,
the swing of their axes on the squarehewed log, shaping it toward the
shape of a mast,
the brisk short crackle of the steel driven slantingly into the pine,
the buttercoloured chips flying off in great flakes and slivers,
the limber motion of brawny young arms and hips in easy costumes
the constructor of wharves, bridges, piers, bulkheads, floats, stays
against the sea
the city firemanthe fire that suddenly bursts forth in the closepacked
square,
the arriving engines, the hoarse shouts, the nimble stepping and daring,
the strong command through the firetrumpets, the falling in line, the rise
and fall of the arms forcing the water,
the slender, spasmic bluewhite jetsthe bringing to bear of the hooks and
ladders, and their execution,
the crash and cutaway of connecting woodwork, or through floors, if the
fire smoulders under them,
the crowd with their lit faces, watchingthe glare and dense shadows
the forger at his forgefurnace, and the user of iron after him,
the maker of the axe large and small, and the welder and temperer,
the chooser breathing his breath on the cold steel, and trying the edge
with his thumb,
the one who cleanshapes the handle and sets it firmly in the socket
the shadowy processions of the portraits of the past users also,
the primal patient mechanics, the architects and engineers,
the faroff assyrian edifice and mizra edifice,
the roman lictors preceding the consuls,
the antique european warrior with his axe in combat,
the uplifted arm, the clatter of blows on the helmeted head,
the deathhowl, the limpsey tumbling body, the rush of friend and foe
thither,
the siege of revolted lieges determined for liberty,
the summons to surrender, the battering at castlegates, the truce and
parley
the sack of an old city in its time,
the bursting in of mercenaries and bigots tumultuously and disorderly,
roar, flames, blood, drunkenness, madness,
goods freely rifled from houses and temples, screams of women in the gripe
of brigands,
craft and thievery of campfollowers, men running, old persons despairing,
the hell of war, the cruelties of creeds,
the list of all executive deeds and words, just or unjust,
the power of personality, just or unjust

muscle and pluck for ever
what invigorates life invigorates death,
and the dead advance as much as the living advance,
and the future is no more uncertain than the present,
and the roughness of the earth and of man encloses as
much as the delicatesse of the earth and of man,
and nothing endures but personal qualities
what do you think endures?
do you think the great city endures?
or a teeming manufacturing state? or a prepared constitution? or the best
built steamships?
or hotels of granite and iron? or any chefsdoeuvre of engineering,
forts, armaments?
away these are not to be cherished for themselves
they fill their hour, the dancers dance, the musicians play
for them
the show passes, all does well enough of course,
all does very well till one flash of defiance
the great city is that which has the greatest man or woman
if it be a few ragged huts, it is still the greatest city in the
whole world

the place where the great city stands is not the place of
stretched wharves, docks, manufactures, deposits of produce,
nor the place of ceaseless salutes of newcomers, or the
anchorlifters of the departing,
nor the place of the tallest and costliest buildings, or shops
selling goods from the rest of the earth,
nor the place of the best libraries and schoolsnor the place where money
is plentiest,
nor the place of the most numerous population
where the city stands with the brawniest breed of orators and bards
where the city stands that is beloved by these, and loves them in return,
and understands them
where no monuments exist to heroes but in the common words and deeds
where thrift is in its place, and prudence is in its place
where the men and women think lightly of the laws
where the slave ceases, and the master of slaves ceases
where the populace rise at once against the neverending audacity of
elected persons
where fierce men and women pour forth, as the sea to the whistle of death
pours its sweeping and unripped waves
where outside authority enters always after the precedence of inside
authority
where the citizen is always the head and idealand president, mayor,
governor, and what not, are agents for pay
where children are taught to be laws to themselves, and to depend on
themselves
where equanimity is illustrated in affairs
where speculations on the soul are encouraged
where women walk in public processions in the streets, the same as the men
where they enter the public assembly and take places the same as the men
where the city of the faithfullest friends stands
where the city of the cleanliness of the sexes stands
where the city of the healthiest fathers stands
where the city of the bestbodied mothers stands,
there the great city stands

how beggarly appear arguments before a defiant deed
how the floridness of the materials of cities shrivels before a mans or
womans look
all waits, or goes by default, till a strong being appears
a strong being is the proof of the race, and of the ability of the
universe
when he or she appears, materials are overawed,
the dispute on the soul stops,
the old customs and phrases are confronted, turned back, or laid away
what is your moneymaking now? what can it do now?
what is your respectability now?
what are your theology, tuition, society, traditions, statutebooks, now?
where are your jibes of being now?
where are your cavils about the soul now?
was that your best? were those your vast and solid?
riches, opinions, politics, institutions, to part obediently from the path
of one man or woman
the centuries, and all authority, to be trod under the footsoles of one
man or woman

a sterile landscape covers the orethere is as good as the best, for all
the forbidding appearance
there is the mine, there are the miners
the forgefurnace is there, the melt is accomplished the hammersmen are at
hand with their tongs and hammers
what always served and always serves is at hand
than this nothing has better servedit has served all
served the fluenttongued and subtlesensed greek, and long ere the greek
served in building the buildings that last longer than any
served the hebrew, the persian, the most ancient hindostanee
served the moundraiser on the mississippiserved those whose relics
remain in central america
served albic temples in woods or on plains, with unhewn pillars, and the
druids
served the artificial clefts, vast, high, silent, on the snowcovered hills
of scandinavia
served those who, time out of mind, made on the granite walls rough
sketches of the sun, moon, stars, ships, oceanwaves
served the paths of the irruptions of the gothsserved the pastoral tribes
and nomads
served the long long distant keltserved the hardy pirates of the baltic
served, before any of those, the venerable and harmless men of ethiopia
served the making of helms for the galleys of pleasure, and the making of
those for war
served all great works on land, and all great works on the sea
for the mediaeval ages, and before the mediaeval ages
served not the living only, then as now, but served the dead

i see the european headsman
he stands masked, clothed in red, with huge legs and strong naked arms,
and leans on a ponderous axe
whom have you slaughtered lately, european headsman?
whose is that blood upon you, so wet and sticky?
i see the clear sunsets of the martyrs
i see from the scaffolds the descending ghosts,
ghosts of dead lords, uncrowned ladies, impeached ministers, rejected
kings,
rivals, traitors, poisoners, disgraced chieftains, and the rest
i see those who in any land have died for the good cause
the seed is spare, nevertheless the crop shall never run out
mind you, o foreign kings, o priests, the crop shall never run out
i see the blood washed entirely away from the axe
both blade and helve are clean
they spirt no more the blood of european noblesthey clasp no more the
necks of queens
i see the headsman withdraw and become useless
i see the scaffold untrodden and mouldyi see no longer any axe upon it
i see the mighty and friendly emblem of the power of my own racethe
newest, largest race

i have what i have

the shape of the sly settee, and the adulterous unwholesome couple
the shape of the gamblingboard with its devilish winnings and losings
the shape of the stepladder for the convicted and sentenced murderer, the
murderer with haggard face and pinioned arms,
the sheriff at hand with his deputies, the silent and whitelipped crowd,
the sickening dangling of the rope
the shapes arise
shapes of doors giving many exits and entrances
the door passing the dissevered friend, flushed and in haste
the door that admits good news and bad news
the door whence the son left home, confident and puffed up
the door he entered again from a long and scandalous absence, diseased,
broken down, without innocence, without means

her shape arises,
she less guarded than ever, yet more guarded than ever
the gross and soiled she moves among do not make her gross and soiled
she knows the thoughts as she passesnothing is concealed from her
she is none the less considerate or friendly therefor
she is the best belovedit is without exceptionshe has no reason to
fear, and she does not fear
oaths, quarrels, hiccupped songs, smutty expressions, are idle to her as
she passes
she is silentshe is possessed of herselfthey do not offend her
she receives them as the laws of nature receive themshe is strong,
she too is a law of naturethere is no law stronger than she is

the main shapes arise
shapes of democracy, total result of centuries
shapes, ever projecting other shapes
shapes of a hundred free states, begetting another hundred
shapes of turbulent manly cities
shapes of the women fit for these states,
shapes of the friends and homegivers of the whole earth,
shapes bracing the earth, and braced with the whole earth
antecedents

with antecedents
with my fathers and mothers, and the accumulations of past ages
with all which, had it not been, i would not now be here, as i am
with egypt, india, phoenicia, greece, and rome
with the kelt, the scandinavian, the alb, and the saxon
with antique maritime ventures,with laws, artisanship, wars, and
journeys
with the poet, the skald, the saga, the myth, and the oracle
with the sale of slaveswith enthusiastswith the troubadour, the
crusader, and the monk
with those old continents whence we have come to this new continent
with the fading kingdoms and kings over there
with the fading religions and priests
with the small shores we look back to from our own large and present
shores
with countless years drawing themselves onward, and arrived at these years
you and me arrivedamerica arrived, and making this year
this year sending itself ahead countless years to come

o but it is not the yearsit is iit is you
we touch all laws, and tally all antecedents
we are the skald, the oracle, the monk, and the knightwe easily include
them, and more
we stand amid time, beginningless and endlesswe stand amid evil and good
all swings around usthere is as much darkness as light
the very sun swings itself and its system of planets around us
its sun, and its again, all swing around us

as for me, torn, stormy, even as i, amid these vehement days
i have the idea of all, and am all, and believe in all
i believe materialism is true, and spiritualism is truei reject no part
have i forgotten any part?
come to me, whoever and whatever, till i give you recognition
i respect assyria, china, teutonia, and the hebrews
i adopt each theory, myth, god, and demigod
i see that the old accounts, bibles, genealogies, are true, without
exception
i assert that all past days were what they should have been
and that they could nohow have been better than they were,
and that today is what it should beand that america is,
and that today and america could nohow be better than they are

in the name of these states, and in your and my name, the past,
and in the name of these states, and in your and my name, the present time
i know that the past was great, and the future will be great,
and i know that both curiously conjoint in the present time,
for the sake of him i typifyfor the common average mans sakeyour sake,
if you are he
and that where i am, or you are, this present day, there is the centre of
all days, all races,
and there is the meaning, to us, of all that has ever come of races and
days, or ever will come

impassive,
this day they ride through manhattan

i do not know whether others behold what i behold,
in the procession, along with the princes of asia, the errandbearers,
bringing up the rear, hovering above, around, or in the ranks marching
but i will sing you a song of what i behold, libertad

when millionfooted manhattan, unpent, descends to its pavements
when the thundercracking guns arouse me with the proud roar i love
when the roundmouthed guns, out of the smoke and smell i love, spit their
salutes
when the fireflashing guns have fully alerted mewhen heavenclouds
canopy my city with a delicate thin haze
when, gorgeous, the countless straight stems, the forests at the wharves,
thicken with colours
when every ship, richly dressed, carries her flag at the peak
when pennants trail, and streetfestoons hang from the windows
when broadway is entirely given up to footpassengers and footstanders
when the mass is densest
when the faades of the houses are alive with peoplewhen eyes gaze,
riveted, tens of thousands at a time
when the guests from the islands advancewhen the pageant moves forward,
visible
when the summons is madewhen the answer, that waited thousands of years,
answers
i too, arising, answering, descend to the pavements, merge with the crowd,
and gaze with them

the nest of languages, the bequeather of poems, the race of eld,

were the children straying westward so long? so wide the tramping?
were the precedent dim ages debouching westward from paradise so long?
were the centuries steadily footing it that way, all the while unknown, for
you, for reasons?
they are justifiedthey are accomplishedthey shall now be turned the
other way also, to travel toward you thence
they shall now also march obediently eastward, for your sake, libertad
old ireland

far hence, amid an isle of wondrous beauty,
crouching over a grave, an ancient sorrowful mother,
once a queennow lean and tattered, seated on the ground,
her old white hair drooping dishevelled round her shoulders
at her feet fallen an unused royal harp,
long silentshe too long silentmourning her shrouded hope and heir
of all the earth her heart most full of sorrow, because most full of love

yet a word, ancient mother
you need crouch there no longer on the cold ground, with forehead between
your knees
o you need not sit there, veiled in your old white hair, so dishevelled
for know you, the one you mourn is not in that grave
it was an illusionthe heir, the son you love, was not really dead
the lord is not deadhe is risen again, young and strong, in another
country
even while you wept there by your fallen harp, by the grave,
what you wept for was translated, passed from the grave,
the winds favoured, and the sea sailed it,
and now, with rosy and new blood,
moves today in a new country
boston town

to get betimes in boston town, i rose this morning early
heres a good place at the corneri must stand and see the show

clear the way there, jonathan
way for the presidents marshal way for the government cannon
way for the federal foot and dragoonsand the apparitions copiously
tumbling
i love to look on the stars and stripesi hope the fifes will play yankee
doodle,
how bright shine the cutlasses of the foremost troops
every man holds his revolver, marching stiff through boston town

a fog followsantiques of the same come limping,
some appear woodenlegged, and some appear bandaged and bloodless
why this is indeed a show it has called the dead out of the earth
the old graveyards of the hills have hurried to see
phantoms phantoms countless by flank and rear
cocked hats of mothy mould crutches made of mist
arms in slings old men leaning on young mens shoulders
what troubles you, yankee phantoms? what is all this chattering of bare
gums?
does the ague convulse your limbs? do you mistake your crutches for
firelocks, and level them?
if you blind your eyes with tears, you will not see the presidents
marshal
if you groan such groans, you might baulk the government cannon
for shame, old maniacs bring down those tossed arms, and let your white
hair be
here gape your great grandsonstheir wives gaze at them from the windows,
see how welldressedsee how orderly they conduct themselves
worse and worse cant you stand it? are you retreating?
is this hour with the living too dead for you?
retreat then pellmell
to your graves back back to the hills, old limpers
i do not think you belong here, anyhow

but there is one thing that belongs hereshall i tell you what it is,
gentlemen of boston?
i will whisper it to the mayorhe shall send a committee to england
they shall get a grant from the parliament, go with a cart to the royal
vaulthaste
dig out king georges coffin, unwrap him quick from the graveclothes, box
up his bones for a journey
find a swift yankee clipperhere is freight for you, blackbellied
clipper,
up with your anchor shake out your sails steer straight toward boston
bay

now call for the presidents marshal again, bring out the government
cannon,
fetch home the roarers from congress,make another procession, guard it
with foot and dragoons
this centrepiece for them
look, all orderly citizens look from the windows, women
the committee open the box set up the regal ribs glue those that will not
stay
clap the skull on top of the ribs, and clap a crown on top of the skull
you have got your revenge, old bluster the crown is come to its own, and

france, the eighteenth year of these states

a great year and place
a harsh, discordant, natal scream outsounding, to touch the mothers heart
closer than any yet

i walked the shores of my eastern sea,
heard over the waves the little voice,
saw the divine infant, where she woke, mournfully wailing, amid the roar of
cannon, curses, shouts, crash of falling buildings
was not so sick from the blood in the gutters runningnor from the single
corpses, nor those in heaps, nor those borne away in the tumbrils
was not so desperate at the battues of deathwas not so shocked at the
repeated fusillades of the guns
pale, silent, stern, what could i say to that longaccrued retribution?
could i wish humanity different?
could i wish the people made of wood and stone?
or that there be no justice in destiny or time?

o liberty o mate for me
here too the blaze, the bullet, and the axe, in reserve to fetch them out
in case of need,
here too, though long repressed, can never be destroyed
here too could rise at last, murdering and ecstatic
here too demanding full arrears of vengeance
hence i sign this salute over the sea,
and i do not deny that terrible red birth and baptism,
but remember the little voice that i heard wailingand wait with perfect
trust, no matter how long
and from today, sad and cogent, i maintain the bequeathed cause, as for
all lands,
and i send these words to paris with my love,
and i guess some chansonniers there will understand them,
for i guess there is latent music yet in francefloods of it
o i hear already the bustle of instrumentsthey will soon be drowning all
that would interrupt them
o i think the east wind brings a triumphal and free march,
it reaches hitherit swells me to joyful madness,
i will run transpose it in words, to justify it,
i will yet sing a song for you, ma femme

the great european year of democracy
europe, the seventysecond and seventythird years of these states

suddenly, out of its stale and drowsy lair, the lair of slaves,
like lightning it leaped forth, half startled at itself,
its feet upon the ashes and the ragsits hands tight to the throats of
kings
o hope and faith
o aching close of exiled patriots lives
o many a sickened heart
turn back unto this day, and make yourselves afresh

and you, paid to defile the people you liars, mark
not for numberless agonies, murders, lusts,
for court thieving in its manifold mean forms, worming from his simplicity
the poor mans wages,
for many a promise sworn by royal lips, and broken, and laughed at in the
breaking,
then in their power, not for all these did the blows strike revenge, or the
heads of the nobles fall
the people scorned the ferocity of kings

but the sweetness of mercy brewed bitter destruction, and the frightened
rulers come back
each comes in state with his trainhangman, priest, taxgatherer,
soldier, lawyer, lord, jailer, and sycophant

yet behind all, lowering, stealinglo, a shape,
vague as the night, draped interminably, head, front, and form, in scarlet
folds,
whose face and eyes none may see
out of its robes only thisthe red robes, lifted by the arm
one finger crooked, pointed high over the top, like the head of a snake
appears

meanwhile, corpses lie in newmade gravesbloody corpses of young men
the rope of the gibbet hangs heavily, the bullets of princes are flying,
the creatures of power laugh aloud,
and all these things bear fruitsand they are good
those corpses of young men,
those martyrs that hang from the gibbetsthose hearts pierced by the grey
lead,
cold and motionless as they seem, live elsewhere with unslaughtered
vitality
they live in other young men, o kings
they live in brothers, again ready to defy you
they were purified by deaththey were taught and exalted
not a grave of the murdered for freedom but grows seed for freedom, in its
turn to bear seed,
which the winds carry afar and resow, and the rains and the snows nourish
not a disembodied spirit can the weapons of tyrants let loose,
but it stalks invisibly over the earth, whispering, counselling,
cautioning

liberty let others despair of you i never despair of you
is the house shut? is the master away?
nevertheless, be readybe not weary of watching
he will soon returnhis messengers come anon
footnote  the years  and
to a foiled revolter or revoltress

courage my brother or my sister
keep on liberty is to be subserved, whatever occurs
that is nothing that is quelled by one or two failures, or any number of
failures,
or by the indifference or ingratitude of the people, or by any
unfaithfulness,
or the show of the tushes of power, soldiers, cannon, penal statutes

what we believe in waits latent for ever through all the continents, and
all the islands and archipelagoes of the sea
what we believe in invites no one, promises nothing, sits in calmness and
light, is positive and composed, knows no discouragement,
waiting patiently, waiting its time

the battle rages with many a loud alarm, and frequent advance and retreat,
the infidel triumphsor supposes he triumphs,
the prison, scaffold, garrote, handcuffs, iron necklace and anklet, lead
balls, do their work,
the named and unnamed heroes pass to other spheres,
the great speakers and writers are exiledthey lie sick in distant lands,
the cause is asleepthe strongest throats are still, choked
with their own blood,
the young men drop their eyelashes toward the ground when they meet
but, for all this, liberty has not gone out of the place, nor the infidel
entered into possession
when liberty goes out of a place, it is not the first to go, nor the second
or third to go,
it waits for all the rest to goit is the last
when there are no more memories of heroes and martyrs,
and when all life and all the souls of men and women are discharged from
any part of the earth,
then only shall liberty be discharged from that part of the earth,
and the infidel and the tyrant come into possession

then courage revolter revoltress
for till all ceases neither must you cease

i do not know what you are for, i do not know what i am for myself, nor
what anything is for,
but i will search carefully for it even in being foiled,
in defeat, poverty, imprisonmentfor they too are great
did we think victory great?
so it isbut now it seems to me, when it cannot be helped, that defeat is
great,
and that death and dismay are great

armed year year of the struggle
no dainty rhymes or sentimental love verses for you, terrible year
not you as some pale poetling, seated at a desk, lisping cadenzas piano
but as a strong man, erect, clothed in blue clothes, advancing, carrying a
rifle on your shoulder,
with wellgristled body and sunburnt face and handswith a knife in the
belt at your side,
as i heard you shouting loudyour sonorous voice ringing across the
continent
your masculine voice, o year, as rising amid the great cities,
amid the men of manhattan i saw you, as one of the workmen, the dwellers in
manhattan
or with large steps crossing the prairies out of illinois and indiana,
rapidly crossing the west with springy gait, and descending the
alleghanies
or down from the great lakes, or in pennsylvania, or on deck along the ohio
river
or southward along the tennessee or cumberland rivers, or at chattanooga on
the mountaintop,
saw i your gait and saw i your sinewy limbs, clothed in blue, bearing
weapons, robust year
heard your determined voice, launched forth again and again
year that suddenly sang by the mouths of the roundlipped cannon,
i repeat you, hurrying, crashing, sad, distracted year
the uprising

rise, o days, from your fathomless deeps, till you loftier and fiercer
sweep
long for my soul, hungering gymnastic, i devoured what the earth gave me
long i roamed the woods of the northlong i watched niagara pouring
i travelled the prairies over, and slept on their breasti crossed the
nevadas,
i crossed the plateaus
i ascended the towering rocks along the pacific, i sailed out to sea
i sailed through the storm, i was refreshed by the storm
i watched with joy the threatening maws of the waves
i marked the white combs where they careered so high, curling over
i heard the wind piping, i saw the black clouds
saw from below what arose and mounted, o superb o wild as my heart, and
powerful
heard the continuous thunder, as it bellowed after the lightning
noted the slender and jagged threads of lightning, as sudden and fast amid
the din they chased each other across the sky
these, and such as these, i, elate, sawsaw with wonder, yet pensive and
masterful
all the menacing might of the globe uprisen around me
yet there with my soul i fedi fed content, supercilious

twas well, o soul twas a good preparation you gave me
now we advance our latent and ampler hunger to fill
now we go forth to receive what the earth and the sea never gave us
not through the mighty woods we go, but through the mightier cities
something for us is pouring now, more than niagara pouring
torrents of men, sources and rills of the northwest, are you indeed
inexhaustible?
what, to pavements and homesteads herewhat were those storms of the
mountains and sea?
what, to passions i witness around me today, was the sea risen?
was the wind piping the pipe of death under the black clouds?
lo from deeps more unfathomable, something more deadly and savage
manhattan, rising, advancing with menacing frontcincinnati, chicago,
unchained
what was that swell i saw on the ocean? behold what comes here
how it climbs with daring feet and hands how it dashes
how the true thunder bellows after the lightning how bright the flashes of
lightning
how democracy with desperate vengeful port strides on, shown through the
dark by those flashes of lightning
yet a mournful wail and low sob i fancied i heard through the dark,
in a lull of the deafening confusion

thunder on stride on, democracy strike with vengeful stroke
and do you rise higher than ever yet, o days, o cities
crash heavier, heavier yet, o storms you have done me good
my soul, prepared in the mountains, absorbs your immortal strong nutriment
long had i walked my cities, my country roads, through farms, only half
satisfied
one doubt, nauseous, undulating like a snake, crawled on the ground before
me,
continually preceding my steps, turning upon me oft, ironically hissing
low
the cities i loved so well i abandoned and lefti sped to the
certainties suitable to me
hungering, hungering, hungering, for primal energies, and natures
dauntlessness,
i refreshed myself with it only, i could relish it only
i waited the bursting forth of the pent fireon the water and air i waited
long
but now i no longer waiti am fully satisfiedi am glutted
i have witnessed the true lightningi have witnessed my cities electric
i have lived to behold man burst forth, and warlike america rise
hence i will seek no more the food of the northern solitary wilds,
no more on the mountains roam, or sail the stormy sea

song of the banner at daybreak
poet
o a new song, a free song,
flapping, flapping, flapping, flapping, by sounds, by voices clearer,
by the winds voice and that of the drum,
by the banners voice, and childs voice, and seas voice, and fathers
voice,
low on the ground and high in the air,
on the ground where father and child stand,
in the upward air where their eyes turn,
where the banner at daybreak is flapping
words bookwords what are you?
words no more, for hearken and see,
my song is there in the open airand i must sing,
with the banner and pennant aflapping
ill weave the chord and twine in,
mans desire and babes desireill twine them in, ill put in life
ill put the bayonets flashing pointill let bullets and slugs whizz
ill pour the verse with streams of blood, full of volition, full of joy
then loosen, launch forth, to go and compete,
with the banner and pennant aflapping
banner and pennant
come up here, bard, bard
come up here, soul, soul
come up here, dear little child,
to fly in the clouds and winds with us, and play with the measureless
light
child
father, what is that in the sky beckoning to me with long finger?
and what does it say to me all the while?
father
nothing, my babe, you see in the sky
and nothing at all to you it says but look you, my babe,
look at these dazzling things in the houses, and see you the moneyshops
opening
and see you the vehicles preparing to crawl along the streets with goods
these ah, these how valued and toiled for, these
how envied by all the earth
poet
fresh and rosy red, the sun is mounting high
on floats the sea in distant blue, careering through its channels
on floats the wind over the breast of the sea, setting in toward land
the great steady wind from west and westbysouth,
floating so buoyant, with milkwhite foam on the waters
but i am not the sea, nor the red sun
i am not the wind, with girlish laughter
not the immense wind which strengthensnot the wind which lashes
not the spirit that ever lashes its own body to terror and death
but i am of that which unseen comes and sings, sings, sings,
which babbles in brooks and scoots in showers on the land
which the birds know in the woods, mornings and evenings,
and the shoresands know, and the hissing wave, and that banner and
pennant,
aloft there flapping and flapping
child
o father, it is aliveit is full of peopleit has children
o now it seems to me it is talking to its children
i hear itit talks to meo it is wonderful
o it stretchesit spreads and runs so fast o my father,
it is so broad it covers the whole sky
father
cease, cease, my foolish babe,
what you are saying is sorrowful to memuch it displeases me
behold with the rest, again i saybehold not banners and pennants aloft
but the wellprepared pavements beholdand mark the solidwalled houses
banner and pennant
speak to the child, o bard, out of manhattan
speak to our children all, or north or south of manhattan,
where our factoryengines hum, where our miners delve the ground,
where our hoarse niagara rumbles, where our prairieploughs are ploughing
speak, o bard point this day, leaving all the rest, to us over alland
yet we know not why
for what are we, mere strips of cloth, profiting nothing,
only flapping in the wind?
poet
i hear and see not strips of cloth alone
i hear the tramp of armies, i hear the challenging sentry
i hear the jubilant shouts of millions of meni hear liberty
i hear the drums beat, and the trumpets blowing
i myself move abroad, swiftrising, flying then
i use the wings of the landbird, and use the wings of the seabird, and
look down as from a height
i do not deny the precious results of peacei see populous cities, with
wealth incalculable
i see numberless farmsi see the farmers working in their fields or barns
i see mechanics workingi see buildings everywhere founded, going up, or
finished
i see trains of cars swiftly speeding along railroad tracks, drawn by the
locomotives
i see the stores, depots, of boston, baltimore, charleston, new orleans
i see far in the west the immense area of graini dwell a while, hovering
i pass to the lumber forests of the north, and again to the southern
plantation, and again to california
sweeping the whole, i see the countless profit, the busy gatherings, earned
wages
see the identity formed out of thirtysix spacious and haughty states, and
many more to come
see forts on the shores of harbourssee ships sailing in and out
then over all, aye aye my little and lengthened pennant shaped like a
sword
runs swiftly up, indicating war and defianceand now the halyards have
raised it,
side of my banner broad and blueside of my starry banner,
discarding peace over all the sea and land
banner and pennant
yet louder, higher, stronger, bard yet farther, wider cleave
no longer let our children deem us riches and peace alone
we can be terror and carnage also, and are so now
not now are we one of these spacious and haughty states, nor any five, nor
ten
nor market nor depot are we, nor moneybank in the city
but these, and all, and the brown and spreading land, and the mines below,
are ours
and the shores of the sea are ours, and the rivers great and small
and the fields they moisten are ours, and the crops, and the fruits are
ours
bays and channels, and ships sailing in and out, are oursand we over all,
over the area spread below, the three millions of square milesthe
capitals,
the thirtyfive millions of peopleo bard in life and death supreme,
we, even we, from this day flaunt out masterful, high up above,
not for the present alone, for a thousand years, chanting through you
this song to the soul of one poor little child
child
o my father, i like not the houses
they will never to me be anythingnor do i like money
but to mount up there i would like, o father dearthat banner i like
that pennant i would be, and must be
father
child of mine, you fill me with anguish,
to be that pennant would be too fearful
little you know what it is this day, and henceforth for ever
it is to gain nothing, but risk and defy everything
forward to stand in front of warsand o, such warswhat have you to do
with them?
with passions of demons, slaughter, premature death?
poet
demons and death then i sing
put in all, aye all, will iswordshaped pennant for war, and banner so
broad and blue,
and a pleasure new and ecstatic, and the prattled yearning of children,
blent with the sounds of the peaceful land, and the liquid wash of the sea
and the icy cool of the far, far north, with rustling cedars and pines
and the whirr of drums, and the sound of soldiers marching, and the hot sun
shining south
and the beachwaves combing over the beach on my eastern shore, and my
western shore the same
and all between those shores, and my everrunning mississippi, with bends
and chutes
and my illinois fields, and my kansas fields, and my fields of missouri
the continentdevoting the whole identity, without reserving an atom,
pour in whelm that which asks, which sings, with all, and the yield of
all
banner and pennant
aye all for ever, for all
from sea to sea, north and south, east and west,
fusing and holding, claiming, devouring the whole
no more with tender lip, nor musical labial sound,
but out of the night emerging for good, our voice persuasive no more,
croaking like crows here in the wind
poet
my limbs, my veins dilate
the blood of the world has filled me fullmy theme is clear at last
banner so broad, advancing out of the night, i sing you haughty and
resolute
i burst through where i waited long, too long, deafened and blinded
my sight, my hearing and tongue, are come to me, a little child taught
me
i hear from above, o pennant of war, your ironical call and demand
insensate insensate yet i at any rate chant you, o banner
not houses of peace are you, nor any nor all their prosperity if need be,
you shall have every one of those houses to destroy them
you thought not to destroy those valuable houses, standing fast, full of
comfort, built with money
may they stand fast, then? not an hour, unless you, above them and all,
stand fast
o banner not money so precious are you, nor farm produce you, nor the
material good nutriment,
nor excellent stores, nor landed on wharves from the ships
not the superb ships, with sailpower or steampower, fetching and carrying
cargoes,
nor machinery, vehicles, trade, nor revenues,but you, as henceforth i see
you,
running up out of the night, bringing your cluster of stars, everenlarging
stars
divider of daybreak you, cutting the air, touched by the sun, measuring the
sky,
passionately seen and yearned for by one poor little child,
while others remain busy, or smartly talking, for ever teaching thrift,
thrift
o you up there o pennant where you undulate like a snake, hissing so
curious,
out of reachan idea onlyyet furiously fought for, risking bloody
deathloved by me
so loved o you banner, leading the day, with stars brought from the night
valueless, object of eyes, over all and demanding allo banner and
pennant
i too leave the restgreat as it is, it is nothinghouses, machines are
nothingi see them not
i see but you, o warlike pennant o banner so broad, with stripes, i sing
you only,
flapping up there in the wind
the bivouacs flame
by the bivouacs fitful flame,
a procession winding around me, solemn and sweet and slowbut first i
note
the tents of the sleeping army, the fields and woods dim outline,
the darkness, lit by spots of kindled firethe silence
like a phantom far or near an occasional figure moving
the shrubs and trees, as i lift my eyes they seem to be stealthily
watching me
while wind in procession thoughts, o tender and wondrous thoughts,
of life and deathof home and the past and loved, and of those that are
far away
a solemn and slow procession there as i sit on the ground,
by the bivouacs fitful flame
bivouac on a mountainside
i see before me now a travelling army halting
below, a fertile valley spread, with barns, and the orchards of summer
behind, the terraced sides of a mountain, abrupt in places, rising high
broken with rocks, with clinging cedars, with tall shapes, dingily seen
the numerous campfires scattered near and far, some away up on the
mountain
the shadowy forms of men and horses, looming, largesized, flickering
and over all, the skythe sky far, far out of reach, studded with the
eternal stars
city of ships
city of ships
o the black ships o the fierce ships
o the beautiful, sharpbowed steamships and sailships
city of the world for all races are here
all the lands of the earth make contributions here
city of the sea city of hurried and glittering tides
city whose gleeful tides continually rush or recede, whirling in and out,
with eddies and foam
city of wharves and stores city of tall faades of marble and iron
proud and passionate city mettlesome, mad, extravagant city
spring up, o city not for peace alone, but be indeed yourself, warlike
fear not submit to no models but your own, o city
behold me incarnate me, as i have incarnated you
i have rejected nothing you offered mewhom you adopted, i have adopted
good or bad, i never question youi love alli do not condemn anything
i chant and celebrate all that is yoursyet peace no more
in peace i chanted peace, but now the drum of war is mine
war, red war, is my song through your streets, o city
vigil on the field
vigil strange i kept on the field one night,
when you, my son and my comrade, dropped at my side that day
one look i but gave, which your dear eyes returned with a look i shall
never forget
one touch of your hand to mine, o boy, reached up as you lay on the ground
then onward i sped in the battle, the evencontested battle
till, late in the night relieved, to the place at last again i made my way
found you in death so cold, dear comradefound your body, son of
responding kisses, never again on earth responding
bared your face in the starlightcurious the scenecool blew the moderate
nightwind
long there and then in vigil i stood, dimly around me the battlefield
spreading
vigil wondrous and vigil sweet, there in the fragrant silent night
but not a tear fell, not even a longdrawn sighlong, long i gazed
then on the earth partially reclining, sat by your side, leaning my chin in
my hands
passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours, with you, dearest comrade
not a tear, not a word
vigil of silence, love, and deathvigil for you, my son and my soldier,
as onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones upward stole
vigil final for you, brave boy, i could not save you, swift was your
death,
i faithfully loved you and cared for you livingi think we shall surely
meet again
till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the dawn appeared,
my comrade i wrapped in his blanket, enveloped well his form,
folded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head, and carefully
under feet
and there and then, and bathed by the rising sun, my son in his grave, in
his rudedug grave, i deposited
ending my vigil strange with thatvigil of night and battlefield dim
vigil for boy of responding kisses, never again on earth responding
vigil for comrade swiftly slain, vigil i never forgethow as day
brightened
i rose from the chill ground, and folded my soldier well in his blanket,
and buried him where he fell
the flag
bathed in wars perfumedelicate flag
o to hear you call the sailors and the soldiers flag like a beautiful
woman
o to hear the tramp, tramp, of a million answering men o the ships they
arm with joy
o to see you leap and beckon from the tall masts of ships
o to see you peering down on the sailors on the decks
flag like the eyes of women
the wounded
a march in the ranks hardpressed, and the road unknown
a route through a heavy wood, with muffled steps in the darkness
our army foiled with loss severe, and the sullen remnant retreating
till after midnight glimmer upon us the lights of a dimlighted building
we come to an open space in the woods, and halt by the dimlighted
building
tis a large old church, at the crossing roadstis now an impromptu
hospital
entering but for a minute, i see a sight beyond all the pictures and
poems ever made
shadows of deepest, deepest black, just lit by moving, candles and lamps,
and by one great pitchy torch, stationary, with wild red flame, and clouds
of smoke
by these, crowds, groups of forms, vaguely i see, on the floor, some in the
pews laid down
at my feet more distinctly, a soldier, a mere lad, in danger of bleeding to
death, he is shot in the abdomen
i staunch the blood temporarily, the youngsters face is white as a lily
then before i depart i sweep my eyes oer the scene, fain to absorb it all
faces, varieties, postures, beyond description, most in obscurity, some of
them dead
surgeons operating, attendants holding lights, the smell of ether, the
odour of blood
the crowd, o the crowd of the bloody forms of soldiersthe yard outside
also filled
some on the bare ground, some on planks or stretchers, some in the death
spasm sweating
an occasional scream or cry, the doctors shouted orders or calls
the glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of the
torches
these i resume as i chanti see again the forms, i smell the odour
then hear outside the orders given, fall in, my men, fall in
but first i bend to the dying ladhis eyes opena halfsmile gives he me
then the eyes close, calmly close and i speed forth to the darkness,
resuming, marching, as ever in darkness marching, on in the ranks,
the unknown road still marching
a sight in camp

a sight in camp in the daybreak grey and dim,
as from my tent i emerge so early, sleepless,
as slow i walk in the cool fresh air the path near by the hospital tent,
three forms i see on stretchers lying, brought out there, untended lying
over each the blanket spread, ample brownish woollen blanket,
grey and heavy blanket, folding, covering all

curious, i halt, and silent stand
then with light fingers i from the face of the nearest, the first, just
lift the blanket
who are you, elderly man, so gaunt and grim, with wellgreyed hair, and
flesh all sunken about the eyes?
who are you, my dear comrade?
then to the second i stepand who are you, my child and darling?
who are you, sweet boy, with cheeks yet blooming?
then to the thirda face nor child nor old, very calm, as of beautiful
yellowwhite ivory
young man, i think i know youi think this face of yours is the face of
the christ himself
dead and divine and brother of all, and here again he lies
a grave

as toilsome i wandered virginias woods,
to the music of rustling leaves kicked by my feetfor twas autumn
i marked at the foot of a tree the grave of a soldier
mortally wounded he, and buried on the retreateasily all could i
understand
the halt of a midday hourwhen, up no time to lose yet this sign left
on a tablet scrawled and nailed on the tree by the grave,
bold, cautious, true, and my loving comrade

long, long i muse,then on my way go wandering,
many a changeful season to follow, and many a scene of life
yet at times through changeful season and scene, abrupt,alone, or in the
crowded street,
comes before me the unknown soldiers grave, comes the inscription rude in
virginias woods,
bold, cautious, true, and my loving comrade
the dresser

an old man bending, i come among new faces,
years, looking backward, resuming, in answer to children,
come tell us, old man, as from young men and maidens that love me, years
hence of these scenes, of these furious passions, these chances,
of unsurpassed heroeswas one side so brave? the other was equally brave
now be witness againpaint the mightiest armies of earth
of those armies, so rapid, so wondrous, what saw you to tell us?
what stays with you latest and deepest? of curious panics,
of hardfought engagements, or sieges tremendous, what deepest remains?

o maidens and young men i love, and that love me,
what you ask of my days, those the strangest and sudden your talking
recalls,
soldier alert i arrive, after a long march, covered with sweat and dust
in the nick of time i come, plunge in the fight, loudly shout in the rush
of successful charge
enter the captured works,yet lo like a swiftrunning river, they fade,
pass, and are gone they fadei dwell not on soldiers perils or soldiers
joys
both i remember wellmany the hardships, few the joys, yet i was
content
but in silence, in dreams projections,
while the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on,
so soon what is over forgotten, and waves wash the imprints off the sand,
in natures reverie sad, with hinged knees returning, i enter the
doorswhile for you up there, whoever you are, follow me without
noise, and be of strong heart
bearing the bandages, water, and sponge,
straight and swift to my wounded i go,
where they lie on the ground, after the battle brought in
where their priceless blood reddens the grass, the ground
or to the rows of the hospital tent, or under the roofed hospital
to the long rows of cots, up and down, each side, i return
to each and all, one after another, i draw nearnot one do i miss
an attendant follows, holding a trayhe carries a refusepail,
soon to be filled with clotted rags and blood, emptied, and filled again
i onward go, i stop,
with hinged knees and steady hand, to dress wounds
i am firm with eachthe pangs are sharp, yet unavoidable
one turns to me his appealing eyespoor boy i never knew you,
yet i think i could not refuse this moment to die for you if that would
save you
on, on i goopen, doors of time open, hospital doors
the crushed head i dress poor crazed hand, tear not the bandage away
the neck of the cavalryman, with the bullet through and through, i
examine
hard the breathing rattles, quite glazed already the eye, yet life
struggles hard
come, sweet death be persuaded, o beautiful death
in mercy come quickly
from the stump of the arm, the amputated hand,
i undo the clotted lint, remove the slough, wash off the matter and blood
back on his pillow the soldier bends, with curved neck, and sidefalling
head
his eyes are closed, his face is pale, he dares not look on the bloody
stump,
and has not yet looked on it
i dress a wound in the side, deep, deep
but a day or two morefor see, the frame all wasted and sinking,
and the yellowblue countenance see
i dress the perforated shoulder, the foot with the bullet wound,
cleanse the one with a gnawing and putrid gangrene, so sickening, so
offensive,
while the attendant stands behind aside me, holding the tray and pail
i am faithful, i do not give out
the fractured thigh, the knee, the wound in the abdomen,
these and more i dress with impassive handyet deep in my breast a fire, a
burning flame

thus in silence, in dreams projections,
returning, resuming, i thread my way through the hospitals
the hurt and the wounded i pacify with soothing hand,
i sit by the restless all the dark nightsome are so young,
some suffer so muchi recall the experience sweet and sad
many a soldiers loving arms about this neck have crossed and rested,
many a soldiers kiss dwells on these bearded lips
a letter from camp

come up from the fields, father, heres a letter from our pete
and come to the front door, motherheres a letter from thy dear son

lo, tis autumn
lo, where the trees, deeper green, yellower and redder,
cool and sweeten ohios villages, with leaves fluttering in the moderate
wind
where apples ripe in the orchards hang, and grapes on the trellised vines
smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines?
smell you the buckwheat, where the bees were lately buzzing?
above all, lo, the sky, so calm, so transparent after the rain, and with
wondrous clouds
below, too, all calm, all vital and beautifuland the farm prospers well

down in the fields all prospers well
but now from the fields come, fathercome at the daughters call
and come to the entry, motherto the front door come, right away
fast as she can she hurriessomething ominousher steps trembling
she does not tarry to smooth her white hair, nor adjust her cap

open the envelope quickly
o this is not our sons writing, yet his name is signed
o a strange hand writes for our dear sono stricken mothers soul
all swims before her eyesflashes with blackshe catches the main words
only
sentences brokengunshot wound in the breast, cavalry skirmish, taken
to hospital,
at present low, but will soon be better

ah, now the single figure to me,
amid all teeming and wealthy ohio, with all its cities and farms,
sickly white in the face and dull in the head, very faint,
by the jamb of a door leans

grieve not so, dear mother, the justgrown daughter speaks through her
sobs
the little sisters huddle around, speechless and dismayed
see, dearest mother, the letter says pete will soon be better

alas poor boy, he will never be better, nor maybe needs to be better,
that brave and simple soul
while they stand at home at the door, he is dead already
the only son is dead
but the mother needs to be better
she, with thin form, presently dressed in black
by day her meals untouchedthen at night fitfully sleeping, often waking,
in the midnight waking, weeping, longing with one deep longing,
o that she might withdraw unnoticedsilent from life escape and withdraw,
to follow, to seek, to be with her dear dead son
war dreams

in clouds descending, in midnight sleep, of many a face in battle,
of the look at first of the mortally wounded, of that indescribable look,
of the dead on their backs, with arms extended wide
i dream, i dream, i dream

of scenes of nature, the fields and the mountains,
of the skies so beauteous after the storm, and at night the
moon so unearthly bright,
shining sweetly, shining down, where we dig the trenches,
and gather the heaps
i dream, i dream, i dream

long have they passed, long lapsedfaces, and trenches, and fields
long through the carnage i moved with a callous composure, or away from the
fallen
onward i sped at the time but now of their faces and forms, at night,
i dream, i dream, i dream
the veterans vision
while my wife at my side lies slumbering, and the wars are over long,
and my head on the pillow rests at home, and the mystic midnight passes,
and through the stillness, through the dark, i hear, just hear, the breath
of my infant,
there in the room, as i wake from sleep, this vision presses upon me
the engagement opens there and then, in my busy brain unreal
the skirmishers beginthey crawl cautiously aheadi hear the irregular
snap snap
i hear the sound of the different missilesthe short tht tht of
the rifleballs
i see the shells exploding, leaving small white cloudsi hear the great
shells shrieking as they pass
the grape, like the hum and whirr of wind through the trees, quick,
tumultuous, now the contest rages
all the scenes at the batteries themselves rise in detail before me again
the crashing and smokingthe pride of the men in their pieces
the chief gunner ranges and sights his piece, and selects a fuse of the
right time
after firing, i see him lean aside, and look eagerly off to note the
effect
elsewhere i hear the cry of a regiment chargingthe young colonel leads
himself this time, with brandished sword
i see the gaps cut by the enemys volleys, quickly filled upno delay
i breathe the suffocating smokethen the flat clouds hover low, concealing
all
now a strange lull comes for a few seconds, not a shot fired on either
side
then resumed, the chaos louder than ever, with eager calls, and orders of
officers
while from some distant part of the field the wind wafts to my ears a shout
of applause, some special success
and ever the sound of the cannon, far or near, rousing, even in dreams, a
devilish exultation, and all the old mad joy, in the depths of my
soul
and ever the hastening of infantry shifting positionsbatteries, cavalry,
moving hither and thither
the falling, dying, i heed notthe wounded, dripping and red, i heed not
some to the rear are hobbling
grime, heat, rushaidesdecamp galloping by, or on a full run
with the patter of small arms, the warning sst of the rifles, these in
my vision i hear or see,
and bombs bursting in air, and at night the varicoloured rockets
o tanfaced prairie boy
o tanfaced prairie boy
before you came to camp came many a welcome gift
praises and presents came, and nourishing foodtill at last, among the
recruits,
you came, taciturn, with nothing to givewe but looked on each other,
when lo more than all the gifts of the world you gave me
manhattan faces

give me the splendid silent sun, with all his beams fulldazzling
give me juicy autumnal fruit, ripe and red from the orchard
give me a field where the unmowed grass grows
give me an arbour, give me the trellised grape
give me fresh corn and wheatgive me serenemoving animals, teaching
content
give me nights perfectly quiet, as on high plateaus west of the
mississippi, and i looking up at the stars
give me odorous at sunrise a garden of beautiful flowers, where i can walk
undisturbed
give me for marriage a sweetbreathed woman, of whom i should never tire
give me a perfect childgive me, away, aside from the noise of the world,
a rural domestic life
give me to warble spontaneous songs, relieved, recluse by myself, for my
own ears only
give me solitudegive me naturegive me again, o nature, your primal
sanities
these, demanding to have them, tired with ceaseless excitement, and
racked by the warstrife,
these to procure incessantly asking, rising in cries from my heart,
while yet incessantly asking, still i adhere to my city
day upon day, and year upon year, o city, walking your streets,
where you hold me enchained a certain time, refusing to give me up,
yet giving to make me glutted, enriched of soulyou give me for ever
faces
o i see what i sought to escape, confronting, reversing my cries
i see my own soul trampling down what it asked for

keep your splendid silent sun
keep your woods, o nature, and the quiet places by the woods
keep your fields of clover and timothy, and your cornfields and orchards
keep the blossoming buckwheat fields, where the ninthmonth bees hum
give me faces and streets give me these phantoms incessant and endless
along the trottoirs
give me interminable eyes give me women give me comrades and lovers by
the thousand
let me see new ones every day let me hold new ones by the hand every day
give me such shows give me the streets of manhattan
give me broadway, with the soldiers marchinggive me the sound of the
trumpets and drums
the soldiers in companies or regimentssome starting away, flushed and
reckless
some, their time up, returning, with thinned ranksyoung, yet very old,
worn, marching, noticing nothing
give me the shores and the wharves heavyfringed with the black ships
o such for me o an intense life o full to repletion, and varied
the life of the theatre, barroom, huge hotel, for me
the saloon of the steamer, the crowded excursion, for me the torchlight
procession
the dense brigade, bound for the war, with highpiled military waggons
following
people, endless, streaming, with strong voices, passions, pageants
manhattan streets, with their powerful throbs, with the beating drums, as
now
the endless and noisy chorus, the rustle and clank of muskets, even the
sight of the wounded
manhattan crowds, with their turbulent musical choruswith varied chorus
and light of the sparkling eyes
manhattan faces and eyes for ever for me
over the carnage

over the carnage rose prophetic a voice,
be not disheartenedaffection shall solve the problems of freedom yet
those who love each other shall become invinciblethey shall yet make
columbia victorious
sons of the mother of all you shall yet be victorious
you shall yet laugh to scorn the attacks of all the remainder of the earth
no danger shall baulk columbias lovers
if need be, a thousand shall sternly immolate themselves for one
one from massachusetts shall be a missourians comrade
from maine and from hot carolina, and another an oregonese, shall be
friends triune,
more precious to each other than all the riches of the earth
to michigan, florida perfumes shall tenderly come
not the perfumes of flowers, but sweeter, and wafted beyond death
it shall be customary in the houses and streets to see manly affection
the most dauntless and rude shall touch face to face lightly
the dependence of liberty shall be lovers,
the continuance of equality shall be comrades
these shall tie you and band you stronger than hoops of iron
i, ecstatic, o partners o lands with the love of lovers tie you

were you looking to be held together by the lawyers?
or by an agreement on a paper? or by arms?
naynor the world nor any living thing will so cohere
the mother of all
pensive, on her dead gazing, i heard the mother of all,
desperate, on the torn bodies, on the forms covering the battlefields,
gazing
as she called to her earth with mournful voice while she stalked

camps of green

not alone our camps of white, o soldiers,
when, as ordered forward, after a long march,
footsore and weary, soon as the light lessens, we halt for the night
some of us so fatigued, carrying the gun and knapsack, dropping asleep in
our tracks
others pitching the little tents, and the fires lit up begin to sparkle
outposts of pickets posted, surrounding, alert through the dark,
and a word provided for countersign, careful for safety
till to the call of the drummers at daybreak loudly beating the drums,
we rise up refreshed, the night and sleep passed over, and resume our
journey,
or proceed to battle

lo the camps of the tents of green,
which the days of peace keep filling, and the days of war keep filling,
with a mystic army, is it too ordered forward? is it too only halting a
while,
till night and sleep pass over?
now in those camps of greenin their tents dotting the world
in the parents, children, husbands, wives, in themin the old and young,
sleeping under the sunlight, sleeping under the moonlight, content and
silent there at last
behold the mighty bivouacfield and waitingcamp of us and ours and all,
of our corps and generals all, and the president over the corps and
generals all,
and of each of us, o soldiers, and of each and all in the ranks we fight,
there without hatred we shall all meet
for presently, o soldiers, we too camp in our place in the bivouaccamps of
green
but we need not provide for outposts, nor word for the countersign,
nor drummer to beat the morning drum
dirge for two veterans

the last sunbeam
lightly falls from the finished sabbath
on the pavement hereand, there beyond, it is looking
down a newmade double grave

lo the moon ascending
up from the east, the silvery round moon
beautiful over the housetops, ghastly, phantom moon
immense and silent moon

i see a sad procession,
and i hear the sound of coming fullkeyed bugles
all the channels of the city streets theyre flooding,
as with voices and with tears

i hear the great drums pounding,
and the small drums steady whirring
and every blow of the great convulsive drums
strikes me through and through

for the son is brought with the father
in the foremost ranks of the fierce assault they fell
two veterans, son and father, dropped together,
and the double grave awaits them

now nearer blow the bugles,
and the drums strike more convulsive
and the daylight oer the pavement quite has faded,
and the strong deadmarch enwraps me

in the eastern sky upbuoying,
the sorrowful vast phantom moves illumined,
tis some mothers large, transparent face,
in heaven brighter growing

o strong deadmarch, you please me
o moon immense, with your silvery face you soothe me
o my soldiers twain o my veterans, passing to burial
what i have i also give you

the moon gives you light,
and the bugles and the drums give you music
and my heart, o my soldiers, my veterans,
my heart gives you love
survivors
how solemn, as one by one,
as the ranks returning, all worn and sweatyas the men file by where i
stand
as the faces, the masks appearas i glance at the faces, studying the
masks
as i glance upward out of this page, studying you, dear friend, whoever you
are
how solemn the thought of my whispering soul, to each in the ranks, and to
you
i see, behind each mask, that wonder, a kindred soul
o the bullet could never kill what you really are, dear friend,
nor the bayonet stab what you really are
the soul, yourself, i see, great as any, good as the best,
waiting secure and content,which the bullet could never kill,
nor the bayonet stab, o friend
hymn of dead soldiers

one breath, o my silent soul
a perfumed thoughtno more i ask, for the sake of all dead soldiers

buglers off in my armies
at present i ask not you to sound
not at the head of my cavalry, all on their spirited horses,
with their sabres drawn and glistening, and carbines clanking by their
thighsah, my brave horsemen my handsome, tanfaced horsemen
what life, what joy and pride, with all the perils, were yours
nor you drummersneither at reveill, at dawn,
nor the long roll alarming the campnor even the muffled beat for a
burial
nothing from you, this time, o drummers, bearing my warlike drums

but aside from these, and the crowds hurrahs, and the lands
congratulations,
admitting around me comrades close, unseen by the rest, and voiceless,
i chant this chant of my silent soul, in the name of all dead soldiers

faces so pale, with wondrous eyes, very dear, gather closer yet
draw close, but speak not
phantoms, welcome, divine and tender
invisible to the rest, henceforth become my companions
follow me ever desert me not, while i live
sweet are the blooming cheeks of the living, sweet are the musical voices
sounding
but sweet, ah sweet, are the dead, with their silent eyes
dearest comrades all now is over
but love is not overand what love, o comrades
perfume from battlefields risingup from foetor arising
perfume therefore my chant, o love immortal love
give me to bathe the memories of all dead soldiers
perfume all make all wholesome
o love o chant solve all with the last chemistry
give me exhaustlessmake me a fountain,
that i exhale love from me wherever i go,
for the sake of all dead soldiers
spirit whose work is done
spirit whose work is done spirit of dreadful hours
ere, departing, fade from my eyes your forests of bayonets
spirit of gloomiest fears and doubts, yet onward ever unfaltering pressing
spirit of many a solemn day, and many a savage scene electric spirit
that with muttering voice, through the years now closed, like a tireless
phantom flitted,
rousing the land with breath of flame, while you beat and beat the drum
now, as the sound of the drum, hollow and harsh to the last, reverberates
round me
as your ranks, your immortal ranks, return, return from the battles
while the muskets of the young men yet lean over their shoulders
while i look on the bayonets bristling over their shoulders
while those slanted bayonets, whole forests of them, appearing in the
distance, approach and pass on, returning homeward,
moving with steady motion, swaying to and fro, to the right and left,
evenly, lightly, rising and falling, as the steps keep time
spirit of hours i knew, all hectic red one day, but pale as death next
day
touch my mouth, ere you departpress my lips close
leave me your pulses of rage bequeath them to me fill me with currents
convulsive
let them scorch and blister out of my chants, when you are gone
let them identify you to the future in these songs
reconciliation
word over all, beautiful as the sky
beautiful that war, and all its deeds of carnage, must in time be utterly
lost
that the hands of the sisters death and night incessantly, softly wash
again, and ever again, this soiled world
for my enemy is deada man divine as myself is dead
i look where he lies, whitefaced and still, in the coffini draw near
i bend down and touch lightly with my lips the white face in the coffin
after the war
to the leavened soil they trod, calling, i sing, for the last
not cities, nor man alone, nor war, nor the dead
but forth from my tent emerging for goodloosing, untying the tentropes
in the freshness, the forenoon air, in the farstretching circuits and
vistas, again to peace restored
to the fiery fields emanative, and the endless vistas beyondto the south
and the north
to the leavened soil of the general western world, to attest my songs,
to the average earth, the wordless earth, witness of war and peace,
to the alleghanian hills, and the tireless mississippi,
to the rocks i, calling, sing, and all the trees in the woods,
to the plain of the poems of heroes, to the prairie spreading wide,
to the faroff sea, and the unseen winds, and the sane impalpable air
and responding they answer all, but not in words,
the average earth, the witness of war and peace, acknowledges mutely
the prairie draws me close, as the father, to bosom broad, the son
the northern ice and rain, that began me, nourish me to the end
but the hot sun of the south is to ripen my songs

roots of the garden,
and the appletrees covered with blossoms, and the fruit afterward, and
woodberries, and the commonest weeds by the road
and the old drunkard staggering home from the outhouse of the tavern,
whence he had lately risen,
and the schoolmistress that passed on her way to the school,
and the friendly boys that passed, and the quarrelsome boys,
and the tidy and freshcheeked girls, and the barefoot negro boy and girl,
and all the changes of city and country, wherever he went

he that had fathered him, and she that had conceived him in her womb, and
birthed him,

they gave him afterward every daythey became part of him

the doubts of daytime and the doubts of nighttimethe curious whether
and how
whether that which appears so is so, or is it all flashes and specks?
men and women crowding fast in the streetsif they are not flashes and
specks, what are they?
the streets themselves, and the faades of houses, and goods in the
windows,
vehicles, teams, the heavyplanked wharvesthe huge crossing at the
ferries,

shadows, aureola and mist, light falling on roofs and gables of white or
brown, three miles off

slacktowed astern,
the hurrying tumbling waves quickbroken crests slapping,
the strata of coloured clouds, the long bar of maroontint, away solitary
by itselfthe spread of purity it lies motionless in,
the horizons edge, the flying seacrow, the fragrance of salt marsh and
shore mud
these became part of that child who went forth every day, and who now goes,
and will always go forth every day

a word out of the sea

out of the rocked cradle,
out of the mockingbirds throat, the musical shuttle,
out of the ninthmonth midnight,
over the sterile sands, and the fields beyond, where the child, leaving his
bed, wandered alone, bareheaded, barefoot,
down from the showered halo,
up from the mystic play of shadows, twining and twisting as if they were
alive,
out from the patches of briars and blackberries,
from the memories of the birds that chanted to me,
from your memories, sad brotherfrom the fitful risings and fallings i
heard,
from under that yellow halfmoon, laterisen, and swollen as if with tears,
from those beginning notes of sickness and love, there in the transparent
mist,
from the thousand responses of my heart, never to cease,
from the myriad thencearoused words,
from the word stronger and more delicious than any,
from such, as now they start, the scene revisiting,
as a flock, twittering, rising, or overhead passing,

once, paumanok,
when the snows had melted, and the fifthmonth grass
was growing,
up this seashore, in some briars,
two guests from alabamatwo together,
and their nest, and four lightgreen eggs spotted with brown
and every day the hebird, to and fro, near at hand,
and every day the shebird, crouched on her nest, silent,
with bright eyes
and every day i, a curious boy, never too close, never
disturbing them,
cautiously peering, absorbing, translating

shine shine shine
pour down your warmth, great sun
while we baskwe two together
two together
winds blow south, or winds blow north,
day come white or night come black,
home, or rivers and mountains from home,
singing all time, minding no time,
if we two but keep together

till of a sudden,
maybe killed, unknown to her mate,
one forenoon the shebird crouched not on the nest,
nor returned that afternoon, nor the next,
nor ever appeared again
and thenceforward, all summer, in the sound of the sea,
and at night, under the full of the moon, in calmer weather,
over the hoarse surging of the sea,
or flitting from briar to briar by day,
i saw, i heard at intervals, the remaining one, the hebird,
the solitary guest from alabama

blow blow blow

i wait and i wait, till you blow my mate to me

yes, when the stars glistened
all night long, on the prong of a mossscalloped stake,
down, almost amid the slapping waves,
sat the lone singer, wonderful, causing tears
he called on his mate
he poured forth the meanings which i, of all men, know
yes, my brother, i know
the rest might notbut i have treasured every note
for once, and more than once, dimly, down to the beach gliding,
silent, avoiding the moonbeams, blending myself with the shadows,
recalling now the obscure shapes, the echoes, the sounds and sights after
their sorts,
the white arms out in the breakers tirelessly tossing,
i, with bare feet, a child, the wind wafting my hair,
listened long and long
listened, to keep, to singnow translating the notes,
following you, my brother

o madly the sea pushes, pushes upon the land,

what is that dusky spot in your brown yellow?
o it is the shape, the shape of my mate
o moon, do not keep her from me any longer
land land o land
whichever way i turn, o i think you could give me my mate back again, if
you only would
for i am almost sure i see her dimly whichever way i look
o rising stars
perhaps the one i want so much will rise, will rise with some of you
o throat o trembling throat
sound clearer through the atmosphere
pierce the woods, the earth
somewhere, listening to catch you, must be the one i want
shake out, carols
solitary herethe nights carols
carols of lonesome love deaths carols
carols under that lagging, yellow, waning moon
o, under that moon, where she droops almost down into the sea
o reckless, despairing carols
but soft sink low
soft let me just murmur
and do you wait a moment, you huskynoised sea
for somewhere i believe i heard my mate responding to me,
so fainti must be still, be still to listen
but not altogether still, for then she might not come immediately to me
hither, my love
here i am here
with this justsustained note i announce myself to you
this gentle call is for you, my love, for you
do not be decoyed elsewhere
that is the whistle of the windit is not my voice
that is the fluttering, the flattering of the spray
those are the shadows of leaves
o darkness o in vain
o i am very sick and sorrowful
o brown halo in the sky, near the moon, drooping upon the sea
o troubled reflection in the sea
o throat o throbbing heart
o alland i singing uselessly, uselessly all the night
yet i murmur, murmur on
o murmursyou yourselves make me continue to sing, i know not why
o past o life o songs of joy
in the airin the woodsover fields
loved loved loved loved loved
but my love no more, no more with me
we two together no more

the aria sinking
all else continuingthe stars shining,
the winds blowingthe notes of the bird continuous echoing,
with angry moans the fierce old mother incessantly moaning,
on the sands of paumanoks shore, grey and rustling
the yellow halfmoon enlarged, sagging down, drooping, the face of the sea
almost touching
the boy ecstaticwith his bare feet the waves, with his hair the
atmosphere, dallying,
the love in the heart long pent, now loose, now at last tumultuously
bursting
the arias meaning the ears, the soul, swiftly depositing,
the strange tears down the cheeks coursing
the colloquy therethe trioeach uttering
the undertonethe savage old mother, incessantly crying,
to the boys souls questions sullenly timingsome drowned secret hissing
to the outsetting bard of love

demon or bird said the boys soul,
is it indeed toward your mate you sing? or is it mostly to me?
for i, that was a child, my tongues use sleeping,
now i have heard you,
now in a moment i know what i am fori awake
and already a thousand singersa thousand songs, clearer, louder, and more
sorrowful than yours,
a thousand warbling echoes, have started to life within me,
never to die
o you singer, solitary, singing by yourselfprojecting me
o solitary me, listeningnever more shall i cease perpetuating you
never more shall i escape, never more, the reverberations,
never more the cries of unsatisfied love be absent from me,
never again leave me to be the peaceful child i was before what there, in
the night,
by the sea, under the yellow and sagging moon,
the messenger there arousedthe fire, the sweet hell within,
the unknown want, the destiny of me
o give me the clue it lurks in the night here somewhere
o if i am to have so much, let me have more
o a word o what is my destination? i fear it is henceforth chaos
o how joys, dreads, convolutions, human shapes and all shapes, spring as
from graves around me
o phantoms you cover all the land, and all the sea
o i cannot see in the dimness whether you smile or frown upon me
o vapour, a look, a word o wellbeloved
o you dear womens and mens phantoms
a word then, for i will conquer it,
the word final, superior to all,
subtle, sent upwhat is it?i listen
are you whispering it, and have been all the time, you seawaves?
is that it from your liquid rims and wet sands?

whereto answering, the sea,
delaying not, hurrying not,
whispered me through the night, and very plainly before daybreak,
lisped to me the low and delicious word death
and again deathever death, death, death,
hissing melodious, neither like the bird nor like my aroused childs heart,
but edging near, as privately for me, rustling at my feet,
creeping thence steadily up to my ears, and laving me softly all over,
death, death, death, death, death
which i do not forget,
but fuse the song of my dusky demon and brother,
that he sang to me in the moonlight on paumanoks grey beach,
with the thousand responsive songs, at random,
my own songs, awaked from that hour
and with them the key, the word up from the waves,
the word of the sweetest song, and all songs,
that strong and delicious word which, creeping to my feet,
the sea whispered me
crossing brooklyn ferry

floodtide below me i watch you face to face
clouds of the west sun there half an hour high i see you also face to
face

crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes, how curious you are
to me
on the ferryboats the hundreds and hundreds that cross, returning home,
are more curious to me than you suppose
and you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are more to me,
and more in my meditations, than you might suppose

the impalpable sustenance of me from all things, at all hours of the day
the simple, compact, welljoined schememyself disintegrated, every one
disintegrated, yet part of the scheme
the similitudes of the past, and those of the future
the glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearingson the
walk in the street, and the passage over the river
the current rushing so swiftly, and swimming with me far away
the others that are to follow me, the ties between me and them
the certainty of othersthe life, love, sight, hearing, of others
others will enter the gates of the ferry, and cross from shore to shore
others will watch the run of the floodtide
others will see the shipping of manhattan north and west, and the heights
of brooklyn to the south and east
others will see the islands large and small
fifty years hence, others will see them as they cross, the sun half an hour
high
a hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence, others will see
them,
will enjoy the sunset, the pouringin of the floodtide, the fallingback
to the sea of the ebbtide
it avails not, neither time nor placedistance avails not
i am with youyou men and women of a generation, or ever so many
generations hence
i project myselfalso i returni am with you, and know how it is
just as you feel when you look on the river and sky, so i felt
just as any of you is one of a living crowd, i was one of a crowd
just as you are refreshed by the gladness of the river and the bright flow,
i was refreshed
just as you stand and lean on the rail, yet hurry with the swift current, i
stood, yet was hurried
just as you look on the numberless masts of ships, and the
thickstemmed pipes of steamboats, i looked
i too many and many a time crossed the river, the sun half an hour high
i watched the twelfthmonth seagullsi saw them high in the air, floating
with motionless wings, oscillating their bodies,
i saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies, and left the
rest in strong shadow,
i saw the slowwheeling circles, and the gradual edging toward the south
i too saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water,
had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams,
looked at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my head
in the sunlit water,
looked on the haze on the hills southward and southwestward,
looked on the vapour as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet,
looked toward the lower bay to notice the arriving ships,
saw their approach, saw aboard those that were near me,
saw the white sails of schooners and sloops, saw the ships at anchor,
the sailors at work in the rigging, or out astride the spars
the round masts, the swinging motion of the hulls, the slender serpentine
pennants,
the large and small steamers in motion, the pilots in their
pilothouses,
the white wake left by the passage, the quick tremulous whirl of the
wheels,
the flags of all nations, the falling of them at sunset,
the scallopedged waves in the twilight, the ladled cups, the frolicsome
crests and glistening,
the stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the grey walls of the granite
storehouses by the docks,
on the river the shadowy group, the big steamtug closely flanked on each
side by the bargesthe hayboat, the belated lighter,
on the neighbouring shore, the fires from the foundry chimneys burning high
and glaringly into the night,
casting their flicker of black, contrasted with wild red and yellow light,
over the tops of houses and down into the clefts of streets
these, and all else, were to me the same as they are to you
i project myself a moment to tell youalso i return
i loved well those cities
i loved well the stately and rapid river
the men and women i saw were all near to me
others the sameothers who look back on me because i looked forward to
them
the time will come, though i stop here today and tonight
what is it, then, between us?
what is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us?
whatever it is, it avails notdistance avails not, and place avails not
i too livedbrooklyn, of ample hills, was mine
i too walked the streets of manhattan island, and bathed in the waters
around it
i too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me
in the day, among crowds of people, sometimes they came upon me,
in my walks home late at night, or as i lay in my bed, they came upon me
i too had been struck from the float for ever held in solution, i too had
received identity by my body
that i was, i knew, was of my bodyand what i should be, i knew, i should
be of my body
it is not upon you alone the dark patches fall,
the dark threw patches down upon me also
the best i had done seemed to me blank and suspicious
my great thoughts, as i supposed them, were they not in reality meagre?
would not people laugh at me?
it is not you alone who know what it is to be evil
i am he who knew what it was to be evil
i too knitted the old knot of contrariety,
blabbed, blushed, resented, lied, stole, grudged
had guile, anger, lust, hot wishes i dared not speak
was wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant
the wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me
the cheating look, the frivolous word, the adulterous wish, not wanting
refusals, hates, postponements, meanness, laziness, none of these wanting
but i was manhattanese, friendly and proud
i was called by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as they
saw me approaching or passing,
felt their arms on my neck as i stood, or the negligent leaning of their
flesh against me as i sat
saw many i loved in the street, or ferryboat, or public assembly, yet
never told them a word
lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing,
sleeping
played the part that still looks back on the actor or actress,
the same old rle, the rle that is what we make it,as great as we like,
or as small as we like, or both great and small
closer yet i approach you
what thought you have of me, i had as much of you
i laid in my stores in advance
i considered long and seriously of you before you were born
who was to know what should come home to me?
who knows but i am enjoying this?
who knows but i am as good as looking at you now, for all you cannot see
me?
it is not you alone, nor i alone
not a few races, nor a few generations, nor a few centuries
it is that each came or comes or shall come from its due
emission, without fail, either now or then or henceforth
everything indicatesthe smallest does, and the largest does
a necessary film envelops all, and envelops the soul for a proper time
now i am curious what sight can ever be more stately and admirable to me
than my masthemmed manhatta,
my river and sunset, and my scallopedged waves of floodtide
the seagulls oscillating their bodies, the hayboat in the twilight, and
the belated lighter
curious what gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand, and with
voices i love call me promptly and loudly by my nighest name as i
approach
curious what is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or man
that looks in my face,
which fuses me into you now, and pours my meaning into you
we understand, then, do we not?
what i promised without mentioning it have you not accepted?
what the study could not teachwhat the preaching could not accomplish, is
accomplished, is it not?
what the push of reading could not start, is started by me personally, is
it not?

flow on river flow with the floodtide, and ebb with the ebbtide
frolic on, crested and scallopedged waves
gorgeous clouds of the sunset, drench with your splendour me, or the men
and women generations after me
cross from shore to shore, countless crowds of passengers
stand up, tall masts of mannahattastand up, beautiful hills of brooklyn
bully for you you proud, friendly, free manhattanese
throb, baffled and curious brain throw out questions and answers
suspend here and everywhere, eternal float of solution
blab, blush, lie, steal, you or i or any one after us
gaze, loving and thirsting eyes, in the house, or street, or public
assembly
sound out, voices of young men loudly and musically call me by my nighest
name
live, old life play the part that looks back on the actor or actress
play the old role, the role that is great or small, according as one makes
it
consider, you who peruse me, whether i may not in unknown ways be looking
upon you
be firm, rail over the river, to support those who lean idly, yet haste
with the hasting current
fly on, seabirds fly sideways, or wheel in large circles high in the air
receive the summer sky, you water and faithfully hold it, till all
downcast eyes have time to take it from you
diverge, fine spokes of light, from the shape of my head, or any ones
head, in the sunlit water
come on, ships from the lower bay pass up or down, whitesailed schooners,
sloops, lighters
flaunt away, flags of all nations be duly lowered at sunset
burn high your fires, foundry chimneys cast black shadows at nightfall
cast red and yellow light over the tops of the houses
appearances, now or henceforth, indicate what you are
you necessary film, continue to envelop the soul
about my body for me, and your body for you, be hung our divinest aromas
thrive, cities bring your freight, bring your shows, ample and sufficient
rivers
expand, being than which none else is perhaps more spiritual
keep your places, objects than which none else is more lasting
we descend upon you and all thingswe arrest you all
we realise the soul only by you, you faithful solids and fluids
through you colour, form, location, sublimity, ideality
through you every proof, comparison, and all the suggestions and
determinations of ourselves
you have waited, you always wait, you dumb, beautiful ministers you
novices
we receive you with free sense at last, and are insatiate henceforward
not you any more shall be able to foil us, or withhold yourselves from us
we use you, and do not cast you asidewe plant you permanently within us
we fathom you notwe love youthere is perfection in you also
you furnish your parts toward eternity
great or small, you furnish your parts toward the soul
night and death

night on the prairies
the supper is overthe fire on the ground burns low
the wearied emigrants sleep, wrapped in their blankets
i walk by myselfi stand and look at the stars, which i think now i never
realised before
now i absorb immortality and peace,
i admire death, and test propositions
how plenteous how spiritual how resum
the same old man and soulthe same old aspirations, and the same content

i was thinking the day most splendid, till i saw what the not day
exhibited,
i was thinking this globe enough, till there sprang out so noiseless around
me myriads of other globes
now, while the great thoughts of space and eternity fill me, i will measure
myself by them
and now, touched with the lives of other globes, arrived as far along as
those of the earth,
or waiting to arrive, or passed on farther than those of the earth,
i henceforth no more ignore them than i ignore my own life,
or the lives of the earth arrived as far as mine, or waiting to arrive

o i see now that life cannot exhibit all to meas the day cannot,
i see that i am to wait for what will be exhibited by death
elemental drifts

elemental drifts
o i wish i could impress others as you and the waves have just been
impressing me
as i ebbed with an ebb of the ocean of life,
as i wended the shores i know,
as i walked where the searipples wash you, paumanok,
where they rustle up, hoarse and sibilant,
where the fierce old mother endlessly cries for her castaways,
i, musing, late in the autumn day, gazing off southward,
alone, held by this eternal self of me, out of the pride of which i have
uttered my poems,
was seized by the spirit that trails in the lines underfoot,
in the rim, the sediment, that stands for all the water and all the land of
the globe
fascinated, my eyes, reverting from the south, dropped, to follow those
slender winrows,
chaff, straw, splinters of wood, weeds, and the seagluten,
scum, scales from shining rocks, leaves of saltlettuce, left by the tide
miles walking, the sound of breaking waves the other side of me,
paumanok, there and then, as i thought the old thought of likenesses
these you presented to me, you fishshaped island,
as i wended the shores i know,
as i walked with that eternal self of me, seeking types

as i wend to the shores i know not,
as i list to the dirge, the voices of men and women wrecked,
as i inhale the impalpable breezes that set in upon me,
as the ocean so mysterious rolls toward me closer and closer,
i too but signify, at the utmost, a little washedup drift,
a few sands and dead leaves to gather,
gather, and merge myself as part of the sands and drift
o baffled, baulked, bent to the very earth,
oppressed with myself that i have dared to open my mouth,
aware now that, amid all the blab whose echoes recoil upon me, i have not
once had the least idea who or what i am,
but that before all my insolent poems, the real me stands yet untouched,
untold, altogether unreached,
withdrawn far, mocking me with mockcongratulatory signs and bows,
with peals of distant ironical laughter at every word i have written,
pointing in silence to all these songs, and then to the sand beneath
now i perceive i have not understood anythingnot a single objectand
that no man ever can
i perceive nature, here in sight of the sea, is taking advantage of me, to
dart upon me, and sting me,
because i have dared to open my mouth to sing at all

you oceans both i close with you
these little shreds shall indeed stand for all
you friable shore, with trails of debris
you fishshaped island i take what is underfoot
what is yours is mine, my father
i too, paumanok,
i too have bubbled up, floated the measureless float, and been washed on
your shores
i too am but a trail of drift and debris,
i too leave little wrecks upon you, you fishshaped island
i throw myself upon your breast, my father,
i cling to you so that you cannot unloose me,
i hold you so firm till you answer me something
kiss me, my father,
touch me with your lips, as i touch those i love,
breathe to me, while i hold you close, the secret of the wondrous murmuring
i envy

ebb, ocean of life, the flow will return
cease not your moaning, you fierce old mother,
endlessly cry for your castawaysbut fear not, deny not me,
rustle not up so hoarse and angry against my feet, as i touch you, or
gather from you
i mean tenderly by you,
i gather for myself, and for this phantom, looking down where we lead, and
following me and mine
me and mine
we, loose winrows, little corpses,
froth, snowy white, and bubbles,
see from my dead lips the ooze exuding at last
seethe prismatic colours, glistening and rolling
tufts of straw, sands, fragments,
buoyed hither from many moods, one contradicting another,
from the storm, the long calm, the darkness, the swell
musing, pondering, a breath, a briny tear, a dab of liquid or soil
up just as much out of fathomless workings fermented and thrown
a limp blossom or two, torn, just as much over waves floating, drifted at
random
just as much for us that sobbing dirge of nature
just as much, whence we come, that blare of the cloudtrumpets
we, capricious, brought hither, we know not whence, spread out before you,
you, up there, walking or sitting,
whoever you arewe too lie in drifts at your feet
wonders

who learns my lesson complete?
boss, journeyman, apprenticechurchman and atheist,
the stupid and the wise thinkerparents and offspringmerchant, clerk,
porter, and customer,
editor, author, artist and schoolboydraw nigh and commence
it is no lessonit lets down the bars to a good lesson,
and that to another, and every one to another still

the great laws take and effuse without argument
i am of the same style, for i am their friend,
i love them quits and quitsi do not halt and make salaams
i lie abstracted, and hear beautiful tales of things, and the reasons of
things
they are so beautiful i nudge myself to listen
i cannot say to any person what i heari cannot say it to myselfit is
very wonderful
it is no small matter, this round and delicious globe, moving so exactly in
its orbit for ever and ever, without one jolt, or the untruth of a
single second
i do not think it was made in six days, nor in ten thousand years, nor ten
billions of years,
nor planned and built one thing after another, as an architect plans and
builds a house
i do not think seventy years is the time of a man or woman,
nor that seventy millions of years is the time of a man or woman,
nor that years will ever stop the existence of me, or any one else

is it wonderful that i should be immortal? as every one is immortal
i know it is wonderfulbut my eyesight is equally wonderful, and how i was
conceived in my mothers womb is equally wonderful
and passed from a babe, in the creeping trance of a couple of summers and
winters, to articulate and walkall this is equally wonderful
and that my soul embraces you this hour, and we affect each other without
ever seeing each other, and never perhaps to see each other, is
every bit as wonderful
and that i can think such thoughts as these is just as wonderful
and that i can remind you, and you think them and know them to be true, is
just as wonderful
and that the moon spins round the earth, and on with the earth, is equally
wonderful
and that they balance themselves with the sun and stars is equally
wonderful
miracles

what shall i give? and which are my miracles?

realism is minemy miraclestake freely,
take without endi offer them to you wherever your feet can carry you or
your eyes reach

why who makes much of a miracle?
as to me, i know of nothing else but miracles,
whether i walk the streets of manhattan,
or dart my sight over the roofs of houses toward the sky,
or wade with naked feet along the beach, just in the edge of the water,
or stand under trees in the woods,
or talk by day with any one i loveor sleep in the bed at night with any
one i love,
or sit at the table at dinner with my mother,
or look at strangers opposite me riding in the car,
or watch honeybees busy around the hive, of a summer forenoon,
or animals feeding in the fields,
or birdsor the wonderfulness of insects in the air,
or the wonderfulness of the sundownor of stars shining so quiet and
bright,
or the exquisite, delicate, thin curve of the new moon in spring
or whether i go among those i like best, and that like me bestmechanics,
boatmen, farmers,
or among the savansor to the soireor to the opera
or stand a long while looking at the movements of machinery,
or behold children at their sports,
or the admirable sight of the perfect old man, or the perfect old woman,
or the sick in hospitals, or the dead carried to burial,
or my own eyes and figure in the glass
these, with the rest, one and all, are to me miracles,
the whole referringyet each distinct and in its place

to me, every hour of the light and dark is a miracle,
every inch of space is a miracle,
every square yard of the surface of the earth is spread with the same,
every cubic foot of the interior swarms with the same
every spear of grassthe frames, limbs, organs, of men and women, and all
that concerns them,
all these to me are unspeakably perfect miracles
to me the sea is a continual miracle
the fishes that swimthe rocksthe motion of the wavesthe ships, with
men in them,
what stranger miracles are there?
visages
of the visages of thingsand of piercing through to the accepted hells
beneath
of uglinessto me there is just as much in it as there is in
beautyand now the ugliness of human beings is acceptable to me
of detected personsto me, detected persons are not, in any respect, worse
than undetected personsand are not in any respect worse than i am
myself
of criminalsto me, any judge, or any juror, is equally criminaland any
reputable person is alsoand the president is also
the dark side
i sit and look out upon all the sorrows of the world, and upon all
oppression and shame
i hear secret convulsive sobs from young men, at anguish with themselves,
remorseful after deeds done
i see, in low life, the mother misused by her children, dying, neglected,
gaunt, desperate
i see the wife misused by her husbandi see the treacherous seducer of
young women
i mark the ranklings of jealousy and unrequited love, attempted to be hid
i see these sights on the earth
i see the workings of battle, pestilence, tyrannyi see martyrs and
prisoners
i observe a famine at seai observe the sailors casting lots who shall be
killed, to preserve the lives of the rest
i observe the slights and degradations cast by arrogant persons upon
labourers, the poor, and upon negroes, and the like
all theseall the meanness and agony without end, i, sitting, look out
upon
see, hear, and am silent
music
i heard you, solemnsweet pipes of the organ, as last sunday morn i passed
the church
winds of autumnas i walked the woods at dusk, i heard your
longstretched sighs, up above, so mournful
i heard the perfect italian tenor, singing at the operai heard the
soprano in the midst of the quartette singing
heart of my love you too i heard, murmuring low, through one of the
wrists around my head
heard the pulse of you, when all was still, ringing little bells last night
under my ear
wherefore?
o me o lifeof the questions of these recurring
of the endless trains of the faithlessof cities filled with the foolish
of myself for ever reproaching myself, for who more foolish than i, and
who more faithless?
of eyes that vainly crave the lightof the objects meanof the struggle
ever renewed
of the poor results of allof the plodding and sordid crowds i see around
me
of the empty and useless years of the restwith the rest me intertwined
the question, o me so sad, recurringwhat good amid these, o me, o life?
answer
that you are herethat life exists, and identity
that the powerful play goes on, and you will contribute a verse
questionable
as i lay with my head in your lap, camerado,
the confession i made i resumewhat i said to you and the open air i
resume
i know i am restless, and make others so
i know my words are weapons, full of danger, full of death
indeed i am myself the real soldier
it is not he, there, with his bayonet, and not the redstriped
artilleryman
for i confront peace, security, and all the settled laws, to unsettle them
i am more resolute because all have denied me than i could ever have been
had all accepted me
i heed not, and have never heeded, either experience, cautions, majorities,
nor ridicule
and the threat of what is called hell is little or nothing to me
and the lure of what is called heaven is little or nothing to me
dear camerado i confess i have urged you onward with me, and still urge
you, without the least idea what is our destination,
or whether we shall be victorious, or utterly quelled and defeated
song at sunset

splendour of ended day, floating and filling me
hour prophetichour resuming the past
inflating my throatyou, divine average
you, earth and life, till the last ray gleams, i sing

open mouth of my soul, uttering gladness,
eyes of my soul, seeing perfection,
natural life of me, faithfully praising things
corroborating for ever the triumph of things

illustrious every one
illustrious what we name spacesphere of unnumbered spirits
illustrious the mystery of motion, in all beings, even the tiniest insect
illustrious the attribute of speechthe sensesthe body
illustrious the passing light illustrious the pale reflection on the new
moon in the western sky
illustrious whatever i see, or hear, or touch, to the last
good in all,
in the satisfaction and aplomb of animals,
in the annual return of the seasons,
in the hilarity of youth,
in the strength and flush of manhood,
in the grandeur and exquisiteness of old age,
in the superb vistas of death
wonderful to depart
wonderful to be here
the heart, to jet the allalike and innocent blood,
to breathe the air, how delicious
to speak to walk to seize something by the hand
to prepare for sleep, for bedto look on my rosecoloured flesh,
to be conscious of my body, so happy, so large,
to be this incredible god i am,
to have gone forth among other godsthose men and women i love
wonderful how i celebrate you and myself
how my thoughts play subtly at the spectacles around
how the clouds pass silently overhead
how the earth darts on and on and how the sun, moon, stars, dart on and
on
how the water sports and sings surely it is alive
how the trees rise and stand upwith strong trunkswith branches and
leaves
surely there is something more in each of the treessome living soul
o amazement of things even the least particle
o spirituality of things
o strain musical, flowing through ages and continentsnow reaching me and
america
i take your strong chordsi intersperse them, and cheerfully pass them
forward
i too carol the sun, ushered, or at noon, or, as now, setting,
i too throb to the brain and beauty of the earth, and of all the growths of
the earth,
i too have felt the resistless call of myself
as i sailed down the mississippi,
as i wandered over the prairies,
as i have livedas i have looked through my windows, my eyes,
as i went forth in the morningas i beheld the light breaking in the east
as i bathed on the beach of the eastern sea, and again on the beach of the
western sea
as i roamed the streets of inland chicagowhatever streets i have roamed
wherever i have been, i have charged myself with contentment and triumph
i sing the equalities
i sing the endless finales of things
i say nature continuesglory continues
i praise with electric voice
for i do not see one imperfection in the universe
and i do not see one cause or result lamentable at last in the universe
o setting sun though the time has come,

appearances
of the terrible doubt of appearances,
of the uncertainty after allthat we may be deluded,
that maybe reliance and hope are but speculations after all,
that maybe identity beyond the grave is a beautiful fable only,
maybe the things i perceivethe animals, plants, men, hills, shining and
flowing waters,
the skies of day and nightcolours, densities, formsmaybe these are as
doubtless they are only apparitions, and the real something has
yet to be known
how often they dart out of themselves, as if to confound me and mock me
how often i think neither i know, nor any man knows, aught of them
maybe seeming to me what they are as doubtless they indeed but seem as
from my present point of viewand might prove as of course they
would naught of what they appear, or naught anyhow, from entirely
changed points of view
to me, these, and the like of these, are curiously answered by my lovers,
my dear friends
when he whom i love travels with me, or sits a long while holding me by the
hand,
when the subtle air, the impalpable, the sense that words and reason hold
not, surround us and pervade us,
then i am charged with untold and untellable wisdomi am silenti require
nothing further,
i cannot answer the question of appearances, or that of identity beyond the
grave
but i walk or sit indifferenti am satisfied,
he ahold of my hand has completely satisfied me
the friend
recorders ages hence
come, i will take you down underneath this impassive exteriori will tell
you what to say of me
publish my name and hang up my picture as that of the tenderest lover,
the friend, the lovers portrait, of whom his friend, his lover, was
fondest,
who was not proud of his songs, but of the measureless ocean of love within
himand freely poured it forth,
who often walked lonesome walks, thinking of his dear friends, his lovers,
who pensive, away from one he loved, often lay sleepless and dissatisfied
at night,
who knew too well the sick, sick dread lest the one he loved might secretly
be indifferent to him,
whose happiest days were far away, through fields, in woods, on hills, he
and another, wandering hand in hand, they twain, apart from other
men,
who oft, as he sauntered the streets, curved with his arm the shoulder of
his friendwhile the arm of his friend rested upon him also
meeting again
when i heard at the close of the day how my name had been received with
plaudits in the capitol, still it was not a happy night for me that
followed
and else, when i caroused, or when my plans were accomplished, still i was
not happy
but the day when i rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health, refreshed,
singing, inhaling the ripe breath of autumn,
when i saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in the morning
light,
when i wandered alone over the beach, and undressing bathed, laughing with
the cool waters, and saw the sunrise,
and when i thought how my dear friend, my lover, was on his way coming, o
then i was happy
o then each breath tasted sweeterand all that day my food nourished me
moreand the beautiful day passed well,
and the next came with equal joyand with the next, at evening, came my
friend
and that night, while all was still, i heard the waters roll slowly
continually up the shores,
i heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands, as directed to me,
whispering, to congratulate me
for the one i love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover in the cool
night,
in the stillness, in the autumn moonbeams, his face was inclined toward me,
and his arm lay lightly around my breastand that night i was happy
a dream
of him i love day and night, i dreamed i heard he was dead
and i dreamed i went where they had buried him i lovebut he was not in
that place
and i dreamed i wandered, searching among burialplaces, to find him
and i found that every place was a burialplace
the houses full of life were equally full of death, this house is now
the streets, the shipping, the places of amusement, the chicago, boston,
philadelphia, the mannahatta, were as full of the dead as of the living,
and fuller, o vastly fuller, of the dead than of the living
and what i dreamed i will henceforth tell to every person and age,
and i stand henceforth bound to what i dreamed
and now i am willing to disregard burialplaces, and dispense with them
and if the memorials of the dead were put up indifferently everywhere, even
in the room where i eat or sleep, i should be satisfied
and if the corpse of any one i love, or if my own corpse, be duly rendered
to powder, and poured in the sea, i shall be satisfied
or if it be distributed to the winds, i shall be satisfied
parting friends
what think you i take my pen in hand to record?
the battleship, perfectmodelled, majestic, that i saw pass the offing to
day under full sail?
the splendours of the past day? or the splendour of the night that envelops
me?
or the vaunted glory and growth of the great city spread around me?no
but i record of two simple men i saw today, on the pier, in the midst of
the crowd, parting the parting of dear friends
the one to remain hung on the others neck, and passionately kissed him,
while the one to depart tightly pressed the one to remain in his arms
to a stranger
passing stranger you do not know how longingly i look upon you
you must be he i was seeking, or she i was seeking it comes to me, as of a
dream
i have somewhere surely lived a life of joy with you
all is recalled as we flit by each other, fluid, affectionate, chaste,
matured
you grew up with me, were a boy with me, or a girl with me
i ate with you, and slept with youyour body has become not yours only,
nor left my body mine only
you give me the pleasure of your eyes, face, flesh, as we passyou take of
my beard, breast, hands in return
i am not to speak to youi am to think of you when i sit alone, or wake at
night alone
i am to waiti do not doubt i am to meet you again
i am to see to it that i do not lose you
other lands
this moment yearning and thoughtful, sitting alone,
it seems to me there are other men in other lands, yearning and thoughtful
it seems to me i can look over and behold them in prussia, italy, france,
spainor far, far away, in china, or in russia or indiatalking
other dialects
and it seems to me, if i could know those men, i should become attached to
them, as i do to men in my own lands
o i know we should be brethren and lovers
i know i should be happy with them
envy
when i peruse the conquered fame of heroes, and the victories of mighty
generals, i do not envy the generals,
nor the president in his presidency, nor the rich in his great house
but when i read of the brotherhood of lovers, how it was with them
how through life, through dangers, odium, unchanging, long and long,
through youth, and through middle and old age, how unfaltering, how
affectionate and faithful they were,
then i am pensivei hastily put down the book, and walk away, filled with
the bitterest envy
the city of friends
i dreamed in a dream i saw a city invincible to the attacks of the whole of
the rest of the earth
i dreamed that it was the new city of friends
nothing was greater there than the quality of robust loveit led the rest
it was seen every hour in the actions of the men of that city,
and in all their looks and words
out of the crowd

out of the rolling ocean, the crowd, came a drop gently to me,
whispering, i love you before long i die
i have travelled a long way, merely to look on you, to touch you
for i could not die till i once looked on you,
for i feared i might afterward lose you

now we have met, we have looked, we are safe
return in peace to the ocean, my love
i too am part of that ocean, my lovewe are not so much separated
behold the great rondurethe cohesion of all, how perfect
but as for me, for you, the irresistible sea is to separate us,
as for an hour carrying us diverseyet cannot carry us diverse for ever
be not impatienta little spaceknow you, i salute the air, the ocean,
and the land,
every day, at sundown, for your dear sake, my love
among the multitude
among the men and women, the multitude,
i perceive one picking me out by secret and divine signs,
acknowledging none elsenot parent, wife, husband, brother, child, any
nearer than i am
some are baffledbut that one is notthat one knows me
ah, lover and perfect equal
i meant that you should discover me so, by my faint indirections
and i, when i meet you, mean to discover you by the like in you
leaves of grass
president lincolns funeral hymn

when lilacs last in the dooryard bloomed,
and the great star early drooped in the western sky in the night,
i mourned,and yet shall mourn with everreturning spring
o everreturning spring trinity sure to me you bring
lilac blooming perennial, and drooping star in the west,
and thought of him i love

o powerful, western, fallen star
o shades of night o moody, tearful night
o great star disappeared o the black murk that hides the star
o cruel hands that hold me powerless o helpless soul of me
o harsh surrounding cloud that will not free my soul

in the dooryard fronting an old farmhouse, near the whitewashed palings,
stands the lilac bush, tallgrowing, with heartshaped leaves of rich
green,
with many a pointed blossom, rising delicate, with the perfume strong i
love,
with every leaf a miracle and from this bush in the dooryard,
with delicatecoloured blossoms, and heartshaped leaves of rich green,
a sprig, with its flower, i break

in the swamp, in secluded recesses,
a shy and hidden bird is warbling a song
solitary, the thrush,
the hermit, withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settlements,
sings by himself a song
song of the bleeding throat
deaths outlet song of lifefor well, dear brother, i know,
if thou wast not gifted to sing, thou wouldst surely die

over the breast of the spring, the land, amid cities,
amid lanes, and through old woods, where lately the violets peeped from the
ground, spotting the greydebris
amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanespassing the endless
grass
passing the yellowspeared wheat, every grain from its shroud in the
darkbrown fields uprising
passing the appletree blows of white and pink in the orchards
carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave,
night and day journeys a coffin

coffin that passes through lanes and streets,
through day and night, with the great cloud darkening the land,
with the pomp of the inlooped flags, with the cities draped in black,
with the show of the states themselves as of crapeveiled women standing,
with processions long and winding, and the flambeaus of the night,
with the countless torches litwith the silent sea of faces,
and the unbared heads,
with the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre faces,
with dirges through the night, with the thousand voices rising strong and
solemn
with all the mournful voices of the dirges, poured around the coffin,
the dimlit churches and the shuddering organswhere amid these you
journey,
with the tolling, tolling bells perpetual clang
here coffin that slowly passes,
i give you my sprig of lilac

nor for you, for one, alone
blossoms and branches green to coffins all i bring
for fresh as the morningthus would i chant a song for you, o sane and
sacred death
all over bouquets of roses,
o death i cover you over with roses and early lilies
but mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first,
copious, i break, i break the sprigs from the bushes
with loaded arms i come, pouring for you,
for you and the coffins all of you, o death

o western orb, sailing the heaven
now i know what you must have meant, as a month since we walked,
as we walked up and down in the dark blue so mystic,
as we walked in silence the transparent shadowy night,
as i saw you had something to tell, as you bent to me night after night,
as you drooped from the sky low down, as if to my side, while the other
stars all looked on
as we wandered together the solemn night, for something, i know not what,
kept me from sleep
as the night advanced, and i saw on the rim of the west, ere you went, how
full you were of woe
as i stood on the rising ground in the breeze, in the cool transparent
night,
as i watched where you passed and was lost in the netherward  black of the
night,
as my soul, in its trouble, dissatisfied, sank, as where you, sad orb,
concluded, dropped in the night, and was gone

sing on, there in the swamp
o singer bashful and tender i hear your notesi hear your call
i heari come presentlyi understand you
but a moment i lingerfor the lustrous star has detained me
the star, my comrade departing, holds and detains me

o how shall i warble myself for the dead one there i loved?
and how shall i deck my song for the large sweet soul that has gone?
and what shall my perfume be for the grave of him i love?
seawinds, blown from east and west,
blown from the eastern sea, and blown from the western sea, till there on
the prairies meeting
these, and with these, and the breath of my chant,
i perfume the grave of him i love

o what shall i hang on the chamber walls?
and what shall the pictures be that i hang on the walls,
to adorn the burialhouse of him i love?
pictures of growing spring, and farms, and homes,
with the fourthmonth eve at sundown, and the grey smoke lucid and bright,
with floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent sinking sun,
burning, expanding the air
with the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale green leaves of the
trees prolific
in the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river,
with a winddapple here and there
with ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky, and
shadows
and the city at hand, with dwellings so dense, and stacks of chimneys,
and all the scenes of life, and the workshops, and the workmen homeward
returning

lo body and soul this land
mighty manhattan, with spires, and the sparkling and hurrying tides, and
the ships
the varied and ample landthe south and the north in the
lightohios shores, and flashing missouri,
and ever the farspreading prairies, covered with grass and corn
lo the most excellent sun, so calm and haughty
the violet and purple morn, with justfelt breezes
the gentle, softborn, measureless light
the miracle, spreading, bathing allthe fulfilled noon
the coming eve, deliciousthe welcome night, and the stars,
over my cities shining all, enveloping man and land

sing on sing on, you greybrown bird
sing from the swamps, the recessespour your chant from the bushes
limitless out of the dusk, out of the cedars and pines
sing on, dearest brotherwarble your reedy song,
loud human song, with voice of uttermost woe
o liquid, and free, and tender
o wild and loose to my soul o wondrous singer
you only i hear, yet the star holds me, but will soon depart
yet the lilac, with mastering odour, holds me

now while i sat in the day, and looked forth,
in the close of the day, with its light, and the fields of spring, and the
farmer preparing his crops,
in the large unconscious scenery of my land, with its lakes and forests,
in the heavenly aerial beauty, after the perturbed winds and the storms
under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing, and the voices of
children and women,
the manymoving seatides,and i saw the ships how they sailed,
and the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all busy with
labour,
and the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each with its meals
and minutiae of daily usages
and the streets, how their throbbings throbbed, and the cities
pentlo then and there,
falling upon them all, and among them all, enveloping me with the rest,
appeared the cloud, appeared the long black trail
and i knew death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of death

and the thought of death closewalking the other side of me,
and i in the middle, as with companions, and as holding the hands of
companions,
i fled forth to the hiding receiving night, that talks not,
down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the dimness,
to the solemn shadowy cedars, and ghostly pines so still
and the singer so shy to the rest received me
the greybrown bird i know received us comrades three
and he sang what seemed the song of death, and a verse for him i love
from deep secluded recesses,
from the fragrant cedars, and the ghostly pines so still,
came the singing of the bird
and the charm of the singing rapt me,
as i held, as if by their hands, my comrades in the night
and the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird

come, lovely and soothing death,
undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,
in the day, in the night, to all, to each,
sooner or later, delicate death
praised be the fathomless universe,
for life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious
and for love, sweet lovebut praise o praise and praise,
for the sureenwinding arms of coolenfolding death
dark mother, always gliding near, with soft feet,
have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?
then i chant it for theei glorify thee above all
i bring thee a song that, when thou must indeed come, come unfalteringly
approach, encompassing deathstrong deliveress
when it is sowhen thou hast taken them, i joyously sing the dead,
lost in the loving, floating ocean of thee,
laved in the flood of thy bliss, o death
from me to thee glad serenades,
dances for thee i propose, saluting theeadornments and feastings for
thee
and the sights of the open landscape, and the highspread sky, are fitting,
and life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night
the night, in silence, under many a star
the ocean shore, and the husky whispering wave, whose voice i know
and the soul turning to thee, o vast and wellveiled death,
and the body gratefully nestling close to thee
over the treetops i float thee a song
over the rising and sinking wavesover the myriad fields, and the prairies
wide
over the densepacked cities all, and the teeming wharves and ways,
i float this carol with joy, with joy, to thee, o death

to the tally of my soul
loud and strong kept up the greybrown bird,
with pure, deliberate notes, spreading, filling the night
loud in the pines and cedars dim,
clear in the freshness moist, and the swampperfume,
and i with my comrades there in the night
while my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed,
as to long panoramas of visions

i saw the vision of armies
and i saw, as in noiseless dreams, hundreds of battleflags
borne through the smoke of the battles, and pierced with missiles, i saw
them,
and carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody
and at last but a few shreds of the flags left on the staffs, and all in
silence,
and the staffs all splintered and broken
i saw battlecorpses, myriads of them,
and the white skeletons of young meni saw them
i saw the debris and debris of all dead soldiers
but i saw they were not as was thought
they themselves were fully at restthey suffered not
the living remained and sufferedthe mother suffered,
and the wife and the child, and the musing comrade suffered,
and the armies that remained suffered

passing the visions, passing the night
passing, unloosing the hold of my comrades hands
passing the song of the hermit bird, and the tallying song of my soul
victorious song, deaths outlet song, yet varying, everaltering song
as low and wailing, yet clear, the notes, rising and falling, flooding the
night,
sadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again bursting
with joy
covering the earth, and filling the spread of the heaven,
as that powerful psalm in the night, i heard from recesses

must i leave thee, lilac with heartshaped leaves?
must i leave thee there in the dooryard, blooming, returning with spring?
must i pass from my song for thee
from my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with thee,
o comrade lustrous, with silver face in the night?

yet each i keep, and all
the song, the wondrous chant of the greybrown bird,
and the tallying chant, the echo aroused in my soul,
with the lustrous and drooping star, with the countenance full of woe
with the lilac tali, and its blossoms of mastering odour
comrades mine, and i in the midst, and their memory ever i keepfor the
dead i loved so well
for the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and landsand this for his
dear sake
lilac and star and bird, twined with the chant of my soul,
with the holders holding my hand, nearing the call of the bird,

o captain my captain
for the death of lincoln

o captain my captain our fearful trip is done
the ship has weathered every wrack, the prize we sought is won
the port is near, the bells i hear, the people all exulting,
while follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring
but, o heart heart heart
leave you not the little spot
where on the deck my captain lies,
fallen cold and dead

o captain my captain rise up and hear the bells
rise up for you the flag is flung, for you the bugle trills
for you bouquets and ribboned wreaths for you the shores acrowding
for you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning
o captain dear father
this arm i push beneath you
it is some dream that on the deck
youve fallen cold and dead

my captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still
my father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will
but the ship, the ship is anchored safe, its voyage closed and done
from fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won
exult, o shores and ring, o bells
but i, with silent tread,
walk the spot my captain lies,
fallen cold and dead

to the sayers of words

earth, round, rolling, compactsuns, moons, animalsall these are words
to be said
watery, vegetable, sauroid advancesbeings, premonitions, lispings of
the future,
behold these are vast words to be said
were you thinking that those were the wordsthose upright lines? those
curves, angles, dots?
no, those are not the wordsthe substantial words are in the ground and
sea,
they are in the airthey are in you
were you thinking that those were the wordsthose delicious sounds out of
your friends mouths?
no the real words are more delicious than they
human bodies are words, myriads of words
in the best poems reappears the body, mans or womans, wellshaped,
natural, gay
every part able, active, receptive, without shame or the need of shame
air, soil, water, firethese are words
i myself am a word with themmy qualities interpenetrate
with theirsmy name is nothing to them
though it were told in the three thousand languages, what would air, soil,
water, fire, know of my name?
a healthy presence, a friendly or commanding gesture, are words, sayings,
meanings
the charms that go with the mere looks of some men and women are sayings
and meanings also

the workmanship of souls is by the inaudible words of the earth
the great masters know the earths words, and use them more than the
audible words
amelioration is one of the earths words
the earth neither lags nor hastens
it has all attributes, growths, effects, latent in itself from the jump
it is not half beautiful onlydefects and excrescences show just as much
as perfections show
the earth does not withholdit is generous enough
the truths of the earth continually wait, they are not so concealed either
they are calm, subtle, untransmissible by print
they are imbued through all things, conveying themselves willingly,
conveying a sentiment and invitation of the earth i utter and utter
i speak not yet, if you hear me not, of what avail am i to you?
to bearto better lacking these, of what avail am i?
accouche accouchez
will you rot your own fruit in yourself there?
will you squat and stifle there?
the earth does not argue,
is not pathetic, has no arrangements,
does not scream, haste, persuade, threaten, promise,
makes no discriminations, has no conceivable failures,
closes nothing, refuses nothing, shuts none out
of all the powers, objects, states, it notifies, shuts none out
the earth does not exhibit itself, nor refuse to exhibit itselfpossesses
still underneath
underneath the ostensible sounds, the august chorus of heroes, the wail of
slaves,
persuasions of lovers, curses, gasps of the dying, laughter of young
people, accents of bargainers,
underneath these, possessing the words that never fail
to her children, the words of the eloquent dumb great mother never fail
the true words do not fail, for motion does not fail, and reflection does
not fail
also the day and night do not fail, and the voyage we pursue does not fail

of the interminable sisters,
of the ceaseless cotillons of sisters,
of the centripetal and centrifugal sisters, the elder and younger sisters,
the beautiful sister we know dances on with the rest
with her ample back towards every beholder,
with the fascinations of youth, and the equal fascinations of age,
sits she whom i too love like the restsits undisturbed,
holding up in her hand what has the character of a mirror, while her eyes
glance back from it,
glance as she sits, inviting none, denying none,
holding a mirror day and night tirelessly before her own face
seen at hand, or seen at a distance,
duly the twentyfour appear in public every day,
duly approach and pass with their companions, or a companion,
looking from no countenances of their own, but from the countenances of
those who are with them,
from the countenances of children or women, or the manly countenance,
from the open countenances of animals, or from inanimate things,
from the landscape or waters, or from the exquisite apparition of the sky,
from our countenances, mine and yours, faithfully returning them,
every day in public appearing without fail, but never twice with the same
companions
embracing man, embracing all, proceed the three hundred and
sixtyfive resistlessly round the sun
embracing all, soothing, supporting, follow close three hundred and sixty
five offsets of the first, sure and necessary as they
tumbling on steadily, nothing dreading,
sunshine, storm, cold, heat, for ever withstanding, passing, carrying,
the souls realisation and determination still inheriting
the fluid vacuum around and ahead still entering and dividing,
no baulk retarding, no anchor anchoring, on no rock striking,
swift, glad, content, unbereaved, nothing losing,
of all able and ready at any time to give strict account,
the divine ship sails the divine sea

whoever you are motion and reflection are especially for you
the divine ship sails the divine sea for you
whoever you are you are he or she for whom the earth is solid and liquid,
you are he or she for whom the sun and moon hang in the sky
for none more than you are the present and the past,
for none more than you is immortality
each man to himself, and each woman to herself, such as the word of the
past and present, and the word of immortality
no one can acquire for anothernot one
not one can grow for anothernot one
the song is to the singer, and comes back most to him
the teaching is to the teacher, and comes back most to him
the murder is to the murderer, and comes back most to him
the theft is to the thief, and comes back most to him
the love is to the lover, and conies back most to him
the gift is to the giver, and comes back most to himit cannot fail
the oration is to the orator, the acting is to the actor and actress, not
to the audience
and no man understands any greatness or goodness but his own, or the
indication of his own

i swear the earth shall surely be complete to him or her who shall be
complete
i swear the earth remains jagged and broken only to him or her who remains
broken and jagged
i swear there is no greatness or power that does not emulate those of the
earth
i swear there can be no theory of any account, unless it corroborate the
theory of the earth
no politics, art, religion, behaviour, or what not, is of account, unless
it compare with the amplitude of the earth,
unless it face the exactness, vitality, impartiality, rectitude, of the
earth
i swear i begin to see love with sweeter spasms than that which responds
love
it is that which contains itselfwhich never invites, and never refuses
i swear i begin to see little or nothing in audible words
i swear i think all merges toward the presentation of the unspoken meanings
of the earth
toward him who sings the songs of the body, and of the truths of the earth
toward him who makes the dictionaries of words that print cannot touch
i swear i see what is better than to tell the best
it is always to leave the best untold
when i undertake to tell the best, i find i cannot,
my tongue is ineffectual on its pivots,
my breath will not be obedient to its organs,
i become a dumb man
the best of the earth cannot be told anyhowall or any is best
it is not what you anticipatedit is cheaper, easier, nearer
things are not dismissed from the places they held before
the earth is just as positive and direct as it was before
facts, religions, improvements, politics, trades, are as real as before
but the soul is also real,it too is positive and direct
no reasoning, no proof has established it,
undeniable growth has established it

this is a poem for the sayers of wordsthese are hints of meanings,
these are they that echo the tones of souls, and the phrases of souls
if they did not echo the phrases of souls, what were they then?
if they had not reference to you in especial, what were they then?
i swear i will never henceforth have to do with the faith that tells the
best
i will have to do only with that faith that leaves the best untold

say on, sayers
delve mould pile the words of the earth
work onit is materials you bring, not breaths
work on, age after age nothing is to be lost
it may have to wait long, but it will certainly come in use
when the materials are all prepared, the architects shall appear
i swear to you the architects shall appear without fail i announce them
and lead them
i swear to you they will understand you and justify you
i swear to you the greatest among them shall be he who best knows you, and
encloses all, and is faithful to all
i swear to you, he and the rest shall not forget youthey shall perceive
that you are not an iota less than they
i swear to you, you shall be glorified in them
voices

now i make a leaf of voicesfor i have found nothing mightier than they
are,
and i have found that no word spoken but is beautiful in its place

o what is it in me that makes me tremble so at voices?
surely, whoever speaks to me in the right voice, him or her i shall follow,
as the water follows the moon, silently, with fluid steps anywhere around
the globe
all waits for the right voices
where is the practised and perfect organ? where is the developed soul?
for i see every word uttered thence has deeper, sweeter, new sounds,
impossible on less terms
i see brains and lips closedtympans and temples unstruck,
until that comes which has the quality to strike and to unclose,
until that comes which has the quality to bring forth what lies slumbering,
for ever ready, in all words
whosoever
whoever you are, i fear you are walking the walks of dreams,
i fear those supposed realities are to melt from under your feet and hands
even now, your features, joys, speech, house, trade, manners, troubles,
follies, costume, crimes, dissipate away from you,
your true soul and body appear before me,
they stand forth out of affairsout of commerce, shops, law, science, work,
farms, clothes, the house, medicine, print, buying, selling,
eating, drinking, suffering, dying
whoever you are, now i place my hand upon you, that you be my poem
i whisper with my lips close to your ear,
i have loved many women and men, but i love none better than you
oh i have been dilatory and dumb
i should have made my way straight to you long ago
i should have blabbed nothing but you, i should have chanted nothing but
you
i will leave all, and come and make the hymns of you
none have understood you, but i understand you
none have done justice to youyou have not done justice to yourself
none but have found you imperfecti only find no imperfection in you
none but would subordinate youi only am he who will never consent to
subordinate you
i only am he who places over you no master, owner, better, god, beyond what
waits intrinsically in yourself
painters have painted their swarming groups, and the centre figure of all,
from the head of the centre figure spreading a nimbus of
goldcoloured light
but i paint myriads of heads, but paint no head without its nimbus of gold
coloured light
from my hand, from the brain of every man and woman, it streams,
effulgently flowing for ever
o i could sing such grandeurs and glories about you
you have not known what you areyou have slumbered upon yourself all your
life
your eyelids have been the same as closed most of the time
what you have done returns already in mockeries
your thrift, knowledge, prayers, if they do not return in mockeries, what
is their return?
the mockeries are not you
underneath them, and within them, i see you lurk
i pursue you where none else has pursued you
silence, the desk, the flippant expression, the night, the accustomed
routine, if these conceal you from others, or from yourself, they
do not conceal you from me
the shaved face, the unsteady eye, the impure complexion, if these baulk
others, they do not baulk me
the pert apparel, the deformed attitude, drunkenness, greed, premature
death, all these i part aside
there is no endowment in man or woman that is not tallied in you
there is no virtue, no beauty, in man or woman, but as good is in you
no pluck, no endurance in others, but as good is in you
no pleasure waiting for others, but an equal pleasure waits for you
as for me, i give nothing to any one, except i give the like carefully to
you
i sing the songs of the glory of none, not god, sooner than i sing the
songs of the glory of you
whoever you are claim your own at any hazard
these shows of the east and west are tame compared to you
these immense meadowsthese interminable riversyou are immense and
interminable as they
these furies, elements, storms, motions of nature, throes of apparent
dissolutionyou are he or she who is master or mistress over them,
master or mistress in your own right over nature, elements, pain, passion,
dissolution
the hopples fall from your anklesyou find an unfailing sufficiency
old or young, male or female, rude, low, rejected by the rest, whatever you
are promulgates itself
through birth, life, death, burial, the means are provided, nothing is
scanted
through angers, losses, ambition, ignorance, ennui, what you are picks its
way
beginners
how they are provided for upon the earth, appearing at intervals
how dear and dreadful they are to the earth
how they inure to themselves as much as to anywhat a paradox appears
their age
how people respond to them, yet know them not
how there is something relentless in their fate, all times
how all times mischoose the objects of their adulation and reward,
and how the same inexorable price must still be paid for the same great
purchase
to a pupil

is reform needed? is it through you?
the greater the reform needed, the greater the personality you need to
accomplish it
you do you not see how it would serve to have eyes, blood, complexion,
clean and sweet?
do you not see how it would serve to have such a body and soul that, when
you enter the crowd, an atmosphere of desire and command enters
with you, and every one is impressed with your personality?

o the magnet the flesh over and over
go, dear friend if need be, give up all else, and commence today to inure
yourself to pluck, reality, selfesteem, definiteness,
elevatedness
rest not, till you rivet and publish yourself of your own personality
links

think of the soul
i swear to you that body of yours gives proportions to your soul somehow to
live in other spheres
i do not know how, but i know it is so

think of loving and being loved
i swear to you, whoever you are, you can interfuse yourself with such
things that everybody that sees you shall look longingly upon you

think of the past
i warn you that, in a little while, others will find their past in you and
your times
the race is never separatednor man nor woman escapes
all is inextricablethings, spirits, nature, nations, you toofrom
precedents you come
recall the everwelcome defiers the mothers precede them
recall the sages, poets, saviours, inventors, lawgivers, of the earth
recall christ, brother of rejected personsbrother of slaves, felons,
idiots, and of insane and diseased persons

think of the time when you was not yet born
think of times you stood at the side of the dying
think of the time when your own body will be dying
think of spiritual results
sure as the earth swims through the heavens, does every one of its objects
pass into spiritual results
think of manhood, and you to be a man
do you count manhood, and the sweet of manhood, nothing?
think of womanhood, and you to be a woman
the creation is womanhood
have i not said that womanhood involves all?
have i not told how the universe has nothing better than the best
womanhood?

to identify the sixteenth, seventeenth, or eighteenth presidentiad
why reclining, interrogating? why myself and all drowsing?
what deepening twilight scum floating atop of the waters
who are they, as bats and nightdogs, askant in the capitol?
what a filthy presidentiad o south, your torrid suns o north, your
arctic freezings
are those really congressmen? are those the great judges? is that the
president?
then i will sleep a while yetfor i see that these states sleep, for

what shapeless lump is that, bent, crouched there on the sand?

a young steersman, steering with care
a bell through fog on a seacoast dolefully ringing,
an oceanbello a warning bell, rocked by the waves
o you give good notice indeed, you bell by the seareefs ringing,
ringing, ringing, to warn the ship from its wreckplace
for, as on the alert, o steersman, you mind the bells admonition,
the bows turn,the freighted ship, tacking, speeds away under her grey
sails
the beautiful and noble ship, with all her precious wealth, speeds away
gaily and safe

greatness

great are the mythsi too delight in them
great are adam and evei too look back and accept them
great the risen and fallen nations, and their poets, women, sages,
inventors, rulers, warriors, and priests
great is liberty great is equality i am their follower
helmsmen of nations, choose your craft where you sail, i sail,
i weather it out with you, or sink with you
great is youthequally great is old agegreat are the day and night
great is wealthgreat is povertygreat is expressiongreat is silence

youth, large, lusty, lovingyouth, full of grace, force, fascination
do you know that old age may come after you, with equal grace, force,
fascination?
day, fullblown and splendidday of the immense sun, action, ambition,
laughter,
the night follows close, with millions of suns, and sleep, and restoring
darkness
wealth, with the flush hand, fine clothes, hospitality
but then the souls wealth, which is candour, knowledge, pride, enfolding
love
who goes for men and women showing poverty richer than wealth?
expression of speech in what is written or said, forget not that silence
is also expressive
that anguish as hot as the hottest, and contempt as cold as the coldest,
may be without words

great is the earth, and the way it became what it is
do you imagine it has stopped at this? the increase abandoned?
understand then that it goes as far onward from this as this is from the
times when it lay in covering waters and gases, before man had
appeared

great is the quality of truth in man
the quality of truth in man supports itself through all changes
it is inevitably in the manhe and it are in love, and never leave each
other
the truth in man is no dictum, it is vital as eyesight
if there be any soul, there is truthif there be man or woman, there is
truthif there be physical or moral, there is truth
if there be equilibrium or volition, there is truthif there be things at
all upon the earth, there is truth
o truth of the earth o truth of things i am determined to press my way
toward you
sound your voice i scale mountains, or dive in the sea, after you

great is languageit is the mightiest of the sciences,
it is the fulness, colour, form, diversity of the earth, and of men and
women, and of all qualities and processes
it is greater than wealth, it is greater than buildings, ships, religions,
paintings, music
great is the english speechwhat speech is so great as the english?
great is the english broodwhat brood has so vast a destiny as the
english?
it is the mother of the brood that must rule the earth with the new rule
the new rule shall rule as the soul rules, and as the love, justice,
equality in the soul rule

great is lawgreat are the old few landmarks of the law,
they are the same in all times, and shall not be disturbed
great is justice
justice is not settled by legislators and lawsit is in the soul
it cannot be varied by statutes, any more than love, pride, the attraction
of gravity, can
it is immutableit does not depend on majoritiesmajorities or what not
come at last before the same passionless and exact tribunal
for justice are the grand natural lawyers, and perfect judgesit is in
their souls
it is well assortedthey have not studied for nothingthe great includes
the less
they rule on the highest groundsthey oversee all eras, states,
administrations
the perfect judge fears nothinghe could go front to front before god
before the perfect judge all shall stand backlife and death shall stand
backheaven and hell shall stand back

great is life, real and mystical, wherever and whoever
great is deathsure as life holds all parts together, death holds all
parts together
has life much purport?ah death has the greatest purport
the poet

now list to my mornings romanza
to the cities and farms i sing, as they spread in the sunshine before me

a young man came to me bearing a message from his brother
how should the young man know the whether and when of his brother?
tell him to send me the signs
and i stood before the young man face to face, and took his right hand in
my left hand, and his left hand in my right hand,
and i answered for his brother, and for men, and i answered for the poet,
and sent these signs
him all wait forhim all yield up tohis word is decisive and final,
him they accept, in him lave, in him perceive themselves, as amid light,
him they immerse, and he immerses them
beautiful women, the haughtiest nations, laws, the landscape, people,
animals,
the profound earth and its attributes, and the unquiet ocean so tell i my
mornings romanza,
all enjoyments and properties, and money, and whatever money will buy,
the best farmsothers toiling and planting, and he unavoidably reaps,
the noblest and costliest citiesothers grading and building, and he
domiciles there,
nothing for any one but what is for himnear and far are for him,the
ships in the offing,
the perpetual shows and marches on land, are for him, if they are for
anybody
he puts things in their attitudes
he puts today out of himself, with plasticity and love
he places his own city, times, reminiscences, parents, brothers and
sisters, associations, employment, politics, so that the rest never
shame them afterward, nor assume to command them
he is the answerer
what can be answered he answersand what cannot be answered, he shows how
it cannot be answered

a man is a summons and challenge
it is vain to skulkdo you hear that mocking and laughter? do you hear
the ironical echoes?
books, friendships, philosophers, priests, action, pleasure, pride, beat up
and down, seeking to give satisfaction
he indicates the satisfaction, and indicates them that beat up and down
also
whichever the sex, whatever the season or place, he may go freshly and
gently and safely, by day or by night
he has the passkey of heartsto him the response of the prying of hands
on the knobs
his welcome is universalthe flow of beauty is not more welcome or
universal than he is
the person he favours by day or sleeps with at night is blessed
every existence has its idiomeverything has an idiom and tongue
he resolves all tongues into his own, and bestows it upon men, and any man
translates, and any man translates himself also
one part does not counteract another parthe is the joinerhe sees how
they join
he says indifferently and alike, how are you, friend? to the president
at his levee,
and he says, goodday, my brother to cudge that hoes in the sugar
field,
and both understand him, and know that his speech is right
he walks with perfect ease in the capitol,
he walks among the congress, and one representative says to another, here
is our equal, appearing and new

then the mechanics take him for a mechanic,
and the soldiers suppose him to be a soldier, and the sailors that he has
followed the sea,
and the authors take him for an author, and the artists for an artist,
and the labourers perceive he could labour with them and love them
no matter what the work is, that he is the one to follow it, or has
followed it,
no matter what the nation, that he might find his brothers and sisters
there
the english believe he comes of their english stock,
a jew to the jew he seemsa russ to the russusual and near, removed from
none
whoever he looks at in the travellers coffeehouse claims him
the italian or frenchman is sure, and the german is sure, and the spaniard
is sure, and the island cuban is sure
the engineer, the deckhand on the great lakes, or on the mississippi, or
st lawrence, or sacramento, or hudson, or paumanok sound, claims him
the gentleman of perfect blood acknowledges his perfect blood
the insulter, the prostitute, the angry person, the beggar, see themselves
in the ways of himhe strangely transmutes them,
they are not vile any morethey hardly know themselves, they are so grown
burial

to think of it
to think of timeof all that retrospection
to think of today, and the ages continued henceforward
have you guessed you yourself would not continue?
have you dreaded these earthbeetles?
have you feared the future would be nothing to you?
is today nothing? is the beginningless past nothing?
if the future is nothing, they are just as surely nothing
to think that the sun rose in the east that men and women were flexible,
real, alive that everything was alive
to think that you and i did not see, feel, think, nor bear our part
to think that we are now here, and bear our part

not a day passesnot a minute or second, without an accouchement
not a day passesnot a minute or second, without a corpse
the dull nights go over, and the dull days also,
the soreness of lying so much in bed goes over,
the physician, after long putting off, gives the silent and terrible look
for an answer,
the children come hurried and weeping, and the brothers and sisters are
sent for
medicines stand unused on the shelfthe camphorsmell has long pervaded
the rooms,
the faithful hand of the living does not desert the hand of the dying,
the twitching lips press lightly on the forehead of the dying,
the breath ceases, and the pulse of the heart ceases,
the corpse stretches on the bed, and the living look upon it,
it is palpable as the living are palpable
the living look upon the corpse with their eyesight,
but without eyesight lingers a different living, and looks curiously on the
corpse

to think that the rivers will flow, and the snow fall, and the fruits
ripen, and act upon others as upon us nowyet not act upon us
to think of all these wonders of city and country, and others taking great
interest in themand we takingno interest in them
to think how eager we are in building our houses
to think others shall be just as eager, and we quite indifferent
i see one building the house that serves him a few years, or seventy or
eighty years at most,
i see one building the house that serves him longer than that
slowmoving and black lines creep over the whole earththey never cease
they are the burial lines
he that was president was buried, and he that is now president shall surely
be buried

gold dash of waves at the ferrywharfposh and ice in the river, half
frozen mud in the streets, a grey discouraged sky overhead, the
short last daylight of twelfthmonth,
a hearse and stagesother vehicles give placethe funeral of an old
broadway stagedriver, the cortege mostly drivers
steady the trot to the cemetery, duly rattles the deathbell, the gate is
passed, the newdug grave is halted at, the living alight, the
hearse uncloses,
the coffin is passed out, lowered, and settled, the whip is laid on the
coffin, the earth is swiftly shovelled in,
the mound above is flattened with the spadessilence,
a minute, no one moves or speaksit is done,
he is decently put awayis there anything more?
he was a good fellow, freemouthed, quicktempered, not badlooking, able
to take his own part, witty, sensitive to a slight, ready with life
or death for a friend, fond of women, gambled, ate hearty, drank
hearty, had known what it was to be flush, grew lowspirited toward
the last, sickened, was helped by a contribution, died, aged forty
one yearsand that was his funeral
thumb extended, finger uplifted, apron, cape, gloves, strap, wetweather
clothes, whip carefully chosen, boss, spotter, starter, hostler,
somebody loafing on you, you loafing on somebody, headway, man
before and man behind, good days work, bad days work, pet stock,
mean stock, first out, last out, turningin at night
to think that these are so much and so nigh to other driversand he there
takes no interest in them

the markets, the government, the workingmans wagesto think what account
they are through our nights and days
to think that other workingmen will make just as great account of them
yet we make little or no account
the vulgar and the refinedwhat you call sin, and what you call goodness
to think how wide a difference
to think the difference will still continue to others, yet we lie beyond
the difference
to think how much pleasure there is
have you pleasure from looking at the sky? have you pleasure from poems?
do you enjoy yourself in the city? or engaged in business? or planning a
nomination and election? or with your wife and family?
or with your mother and sisters? or in womanly housework? or the beautiful
maternal cares?
these also flow onward to othersyou and i fly onward,
but in due time you and i shall take less interest in them
your farm, profits, crops,to think how engrossed you are
to think there will still be farms, profits, cropsyet for you, of what
avail?

what will be will be wellfor what is is well
to take interest is well, and not to take interest shall be well
the sky continues beautiful,
the pleasure of men with women shall never be sated, nor the pleasure of
women with men, nor the pleasure from poems
the domestic joys, the daily housework or business, the building of
housesthese are not phantasmsthey have weight, form, location
farms, profits, crops, markets, wages, government, are none of them
phantasms
the difference between sin and goodness is no delusion,
the earth is not an echoman and his life, and all the things of his life,
are wellconsidered
you are not thrown to the windsyou gather certainly and safely around
yourself
yourself yourself yourself, for ever and ever

it is not to diffuse you that you were born of your mother and fatherit
is to identify you
it is not that you should be undecided, but that you should
be decided
something long preparing and formless is arrived and formed in you,
you are henceforth secure, whatever comes or goes
the threads that were spun are gathered, the weft crosses the warp, the
pattern is systematic
the preparations have every one been justified,
the orchestra have sufficiently tuned their instrumentsthe baton has
given the signal
the guest that was cominghe waited long, for reasonshe is now housed
he is one of those who are beautiful and happyhe is one of those that to
look upon and be with is enough
the law of the past cannot be eluded,
the law of the present and future cannot be eluded,
the law of the living cannot be eludedit is eternal
the law of promotion and transformation cannot be eluded,
the law of heroes and gooddoers cannot be eluded,
the law of drunkards, informers, mean personsnot one iota thereof can be
eluded

slowmoving and black lines go ceaselessly over the earth,
northerner goes carried, and southerner goes carried, and they on the
atlantic side, and they on the pacific, and they between, and all
through the mississippi country, and all over the earth
the great masters and kosmos are well as they gothe heroes and gooddoers
are well,
the known leaders and inventors, and the rich owners and pious and
distinguished, may be well,
but there is more account than thatthere is strict account of all
the interminable hordes of the ignorant and wicked are not nothing,
the barbarians of africa and asia are not nothing,
the common people of europe are not nothingthe american aborigines are
not nothing,
the infected in the immigrant hospital are not nothingthe murderer or
mean person is not nothing,
the perpetual successions of shallow people are not nothing as they go,
the lowest prostitute is not nothingthe mocker of religion is not nothing
as he goes

i shall go with the restwe have satisfaction,
i have dreamed that we are not to be changed so much, nor the law of us
changed,
i have dreamed that heroes and gooddoers shall be under the present and
past law,
and that murderers, drunkards, liars, shall be under the present and past
law,
for i have dreamed that the law they are under now is enough
and i have dreamed that the satisfaction is not so much changed, and that
there is no life without satisfaction
what is the earth? what are body and soul without satisfaction?
i shall go with the rest,
we cannot be stopped at a given pointthat is no satisfaction,
to show us a good thing, or a few good things, for a space of timethat is
no satisfaction,
we must have the indestructible breed of the best, regardless of time
if otherwise, all these things came but to ashes of dung,
if maggots and rats ended us, then alarum for we are betrayed
then indeed suspicion of death
do you suspect death? if i were to suspect death, i should die now
do you think i could walk pleasantly and wellsuited toward annihilation?

pleasantly and wellsuited i walk
whither i walk i cannot define, but i know it is good
the whole universe indicates that it is good,
the past and the present indicate that it is good
how beautiful and perfect are the animals how perfect is my soul
how perfect the earth, and the minutest thing upon it
what is called good is perfect, and what is called bad is just as perfect,
the vegetables and minerals are all perfect, and the imponderable fluids
are perfect
slowly and surely they have passed on to this, and slowly and surely they
yet pass on
my soul if i realise you, i have satisfaction
animals and vegetables if i realise you, i have satisfaction
laws of the earth and air if i realise you, i have satisfaction
i cannot define my satisfaction, yet it is so
i cannot define my life, yet it is so

it comes to me now
i swear i think now that everything without exception has an eternal soul
the trees have, rooted in the ground the weeds of the sea have the
animals
i swear i think there is nothing but immortality
that the exquisite scheme is for it, and the nebulous float is for it, and
the cohering is for it
and all preparation is for it and identity is for it and life and death
are altogether for it
this compost

something startles me where i thought i was safest
i withdraw from the still woods i loved
i will not go now on the pastures to walk
i will not strip the clothes from my body to meet my lover the sea
i will not touch my flesh to the earth, as to other flesh, to renew me

o how can the ground not sicken?
how can you be alive, you growths of spring?
how can you furnish health, you blood of herbs, roots, orchards, grain?
are they not continually putting distempered corpses in you?
is not every continent worked over and over with sour dead?
where have you disposed of their carcasses?
those drunkards and gluttons of so many generations
where have you drawn off all the foul liquid and meat?
i do not see any of it upon you todayor perhaps i am deceived
i will run a furrow with my ploughi will press my spade through the sod,
and turn it up underneath
i am sure i shall expose some of the foul meat

behold this compost behold it well
perhaps every mite has once formed part of a sick personyet behold
the grass covers the prairies,
the bean bursts noiselessly through the mould in the garden,
the delicate spear of the onion pierces upward,
the applebuds cluster together on the apple branches,
the resurrection of the wheat appears with pale visage out of its graves,
the tinge awakes over the willowtree and the mulberrytree,
the hebirds carol mornings and evenings, while the shebirds sit on their
nests,
the young of poultry break through the hatched eggs,
the newborn of animals appearthe calf is dropped from the cow, the colt
from the mare,
out of its little hill faithfully rise the potatos darkgreen leaves,
out of its hill rises the yellow maizestalk
the summer growth is innocent and disdainful above all those strata of sour
dead
what chemistry
that the winds are really not infectious,
that this is no cheat, this transparent greenwash of the sea, which is so
amorous after me
that it is safe to allow it to lick my naked body all over with its
tongues,
that it will not endanger me with the fevers that have deposited themselves
in it,
that all is clean for ever and for ever,
that the cool drink from the well tastes so good,
that blackberries are so flavorous and juicy,
that the fruits of the appleorchard, and of the orangeorchardthat
melons, grapes, peaches, plums, will none of them poison me,
that when i recline on the grass i do not catch any disease,
though probably every sphere of grass rises out of what was once a catching
disease

now i am terrified at the earth it is that calm and patient,
it grows such sweet things out of such corruptions,
it turns harmless and stainless on its axis, with such endless successions
of diseased corpses,
it distils such exquisite winds out of such infused fetor,
it renews with such unwitting looks its prodigal, annual, sumptuous crops,
it gives such divine materials to men, and accepts such leavings from them
at last
despairing cries

despairing cries float ceaselessly toward me, day and night,
the sad voice of deaththe call of my nearest lover, putting forth,
alarmed, uncertain,
the sea i am quickly to sail come tell me,
come tell me where i am speedingtell me my destination

i understand your anguish, but i cannot help you
i approach, hear, beholdthe sad mouth, the look out of the eyes, your
mute inquiry,
whither i go from the bed i recline on, come tell me
old age, alarmed, uncertaina young womans voice, appealing to me for
comfort
a young mans voice, shall i not escape?
the city deadhouse
by the city deadhouse, by the gate,
as idly sauntering, wending my way from the clangour,
i curious pausefor lo an outcast form, a poor dead prostitute brought
her corpse they deposit unclaimed, it lies on the damp brick pavement
the divine woman, her bodyi see the bodyi look on it alone,
that house once full of passion and beautyall else i notice not
nor stillness so cold, nor running water from faucet, nor odours morbific
impress me
but the house alonethat wondrous housethat delicate fair housethat
ruin
that immortal house, more than all the rows of dwellings ever built,
or whitedomed capitol itself, with majestic figure surmountedor all the
old highspired cathedrals,
that little house alone, more than them allpoor, desperate house
fair, fearful wreck tenement of a soul itself a soul
unclaimed, avoided house take one breath from my tremulous lips
take one tear, dropped aside as i go, for thought of you,
dead house of love house of madness and sin, crumbled crushed
house of lifeerewhile talking and laughingbut ah, poor house dead even
then
months, years, an echoing, garnished housebut dead, dead, dead
to one shortly to die

from all the rest i single out you, having a message for you
you are to dielet others tell you what they please, i cannot prevaricate,
i am exact and merciless, but i love youthere is no escape for you

softly i lay my right hand upon youyou just feel it
i do not arguei bend my head close, and half envelop it,
i sit quietly byi remain faithful,
i am more than nurse, more than parent or neighbour,
i absolve you from all except yourself, spiritual, bodilythat is
eternal,
the corpse you will leave will be but excrementitious
the sun bursts through in unlookedfor directions
strong thoughts fill you, and confidenceyou smile
you forget you are sick, as i forget you are sick,
you do not see the medicinesyou do not mind the weeping friendsi am
with you,
i exclude others from youthere is nothing to be commiserated,
i do not commiseratei congratulate you
unnamed lands

nations, ten thousand years before these states, and many times ten
thousand years before these states
garnered clusters of ages, that men and women like us grew up and travelled
their course, and passed on
what vastbuilt citieswhat orderly republicswhat pastoral tribes and
nomads
what histories, rulers, heroes, perhaps transcending all others
what laws, customs, wealth, arts, traditions
what sort of marriagewhat costumeswhat physiology and phrenology
what of liberty and slavery among themwhat they thought of death and the
soul
who were witty and wisewho beautiful and poeticwho brutish and
undeveloped
not a mark, not a record remains,and yet all remains

o i know that those men and women were not for nothing, any more than we
are for nothing
i know that they belong to the scheme of the world every bit as much as we
now belong to it, and as all will henceforth belong to it
afar they standyet near to me they stand,
some with oval countenances, learned and calm,
some naked and savagesome like huge collections of insects,
some in tentsherdsmen, patriarchs, tribes, horsemen,
some prowling through woodssome living peaceably on farms, labouring,
reaping, filling barns,
some traversing paved avenues, amid temples, palaces, factories, libraries,
shows, courts, theatres, wonderful monuments
are those billions of men really gone?
are those women of the old experience of the earth gone?
do their lives, cities, arts, rest only with us?
did they achieve nothing for good, for themselves?

i believe, of all those billions of men and women that filled the unnamed
lands, every one exists this hour, here or elsewhere, invisible to
us, in exact proportion to what he or she grew from in life, and
out of what he or she did, felt, became, loved, sinned, in life
i believe that was not the end of those nations, or any person of them, any
more than this shall be the end of my nation, or of me
of their languages, governments, marriage, literature, products, games,
wars, manners, crimes, prisons, slaves, heroes, poets, i suspect
their results curiously await in the yet unseen worldcounterparts
of what accrued to them in the seen world
i suspect i shall meet them there,
i suspect i shall there find each old particular of those unnamed lands
similitude

on the beach at night alone,
as the old mother sways her to and fro, singing her savage and husky song,
as i watch the bright stars shiningi think a thought of the clef of the
universes, and of the future

a vast similitude interlocks all,
all spheres, grown, ungrown, small, large, suns, moons, planets, comets,
asteroids,
all the substances of the same, and all that is spiritual upon the same,
all distances of place, however wide,
all distances of timeall inanimate forms,
all soulsall living bodies, though they be ever so different, or in
different worlds,
all gaseous, watery, vegetable, mineral processesthe fishes, the brutes,
all men and womenme also
all nations, colours, barbarisms, civilisations, languages
all identities that have existed, or may exist, on this globe, or any
globe
all lives and deathsall of the past, present, future
this vast similitude spans them, and always has spanned, and shall for ever
span them, and compactly hold them

comrade of criminals, brother of slaves,
crafty, despised, a drudge, ignorant,
with sudra face and worn browblack, but in the depths of my heart proud

methodically wrong
songs of parting
singers and poets

the indications and tally of time
perfect sanity shows the master among philosophs
time, always without flaw, indicates itself in parts
what always indicates the poet is the crowd of the pleasant company of
singers, and their words
the words of the singers are the hours or minutes of the light or darkbut
the words of the maker of poems are the general light and dark
the maker of poems settles justice, reality, immortality,
his insight and power encircle things and the human race,
he is the glory and extract, thus far, of things and of the human race

the singers do not begetonly the poet begets
the singers are welcomed, understood, appear often enoughbut rare has the
day been, likewise the spot, of the birth of the maker of poems
not every century, or every five centuries, has contained such a day, for
all its names
the singers of successive hours of centuries may have ostensible names, but
the name of each of them is one of the singers
the name of each is eyesinger, earsinger, headsinger,
sweetsinger, echosinger, parloursinger, lovesinger, or something else

all this time, and at all times, wait the words of poems
the greatness of sons is the exuding of the greatness of mothers and
fathers
the words of poems are the tuft and final applause of science
divine instinct, breadth of vision, the law of reason, health, rudeness of
body, withdrawnness, gaiety, suntan, airsweetnesssuch are some
of the words of poems

the sailor and traveller underlie the maker of poems,
the builder, geometer, chemist, anatomist, phrenologist, artistall these
underlie the maker of poems

the words of the true poems give you more than poems,
they give you, to form for yourself, poems, religions, politics, war,
peace, behaviour, histories, essays, romances, and everything else,
they balance ranks, colours, races, creeds, and the sexes,
they do not seek beautythey are sought,
for ever touching them, or close upon them, follows beauty, longing, fain,
lovesick
they prepare for deathyet are they not the finish, but rather the outset,
they bring none to his or her terminus, or to be content and full
whom they take, they take into space, to behold the birth of stars, to
learn one of the meanings,
to launch off with absolute faithto sweep through the ceaseless rings,
and never be quiet again
to a historian
you who celebrate bygones
who have explored the outward, the surfaces of the racesthe life that has
exhibited itself
who have treated of man as the creature of politics, aggregates, rulers,
and priests
i, habitu of the alleghanies, treating man as he is in himself, in his own
rights,
pressing the pulse of the life that has seldom exhibited itself, the great
pride of man in himself
chanter of personality, outlining what is yet to be
i project the history of the future
fit audience

whoever you are, holding me now in hand,
without one thing, all will be useless
i give you fair warning, before you attempt me further,
i am not what you supposed, but far different

who is he that would become my follower?
who would sign himself a candidate for my affections?
the way is suspiciousthe result uncertain, perhaps destructive
you would have to give up all elsei alone would expect to be your god,
sole and exclusive
your novitiate would even then be long and exhausting,
the whole past theory of your life, and all conformity to the lives around
you, would have to be abandoned
therefore release me now, before troubling yourself any furtherlet go
your hand from my shoulders,
put me down, and depart on your way
or else, by stealth, in some wood, for trial,
or back of a rock, in the open air,
for in any roofed room of a house i emerge notnor in company,
and in libraries i lie as one dumb, a gawk, or unborn, or dead,
but just possibly with you on a high hillfirst watching lest any person,
for miles around, approach unawares
or possibly with you sailing at sea, or on the beach of the sea, or some
quiet island,
here to put your lips upon mine i permit you,
with the comrades longdwelling kiss, or the new husbands kiss,
for i am the new husband, and i am the comrade
or, if you will, thrusting me beneath your clothing,
where i may feel the throbs of your heart, or rest upon your hip,
carry me when you go forth over land or sea
for thus, merely touching you, is enoughis best,
and thus, touching you, would i silently sleep, and be carried eternally

but these leaves conning, you con at peril,
for these leaves, and me, you will not understand,
they will elude you at first, and still more afterwardi will certainly
elude you,
even while you should think you had unquestionably caught me, behold
already you see i have escaped from you
for it is not for what i have put into it that i have written this book,
nor is it by reading it you will acquire it,
nor do those know me best who admire me, and vauntingly praise me,
nor will the candidates for my love unless at most a very few prove
victorious,
nor will my poems do good onlythey will do just as much evil, perhaps
more
for all is useless without that which you may guess at many times and not
hitthat which i hinted at
therefore release me, and depart on your way
singing in spring
these i, singing in spring, collect for lovers
for who but i should understand lovers, and all their sorrow and joy?
and who but i should be the poet of comrades?
collecting, i traverse the garden, the worldbut soon i pass the gates,
now along the pondsidenow wading in a little, fearing not the wet,
now by the postandrail fences, where the old stones thrown there, picked
from the fields, have accumulated,
wild flowers and vines and weeds come up through the stones, and partly
cover thembeyond these i pass,
far, far in the forest, before i think where i go,
solitary, smelling the earthy smell, stopping now and then in the silence
alone, i had thoughtyet soon a silent troop gathers around me
some walk by my side, and some behind, and some embrace my arms or neck,
they, the spirits of friends, dead or alivethicker they come, a great
crowd, and i in the middle,
collecting, dispensing, singing in spring, there i wander with them,
plucking something for tokenstossing toward whoever is near me
here lilac, with a branch of pine,
here, out of my pocket, some moss which i pulled off a liveoak in florida,
as it hung trailing down,
here some pinks and laurel leaves, and a handful of sage,
and here what i now draw from the water, wading in the pondside,
o here i last saw him that tenderly loves meand returns again, never to
separate from me,
and this, o this shall henceforth be the token of comradesthis calamus
root shall,
interchange it, youths, with each other let none render it back
and twigs of maple, and a bunch of wild orange, and chestnut,
and stems of currants, and plumblows, and the aromatic cedar,
these i, compassed around by a thick cloud of spirits,
wandering, point to, or touch as i pass, or throw them loosely from me,
indicating to each one what he shall havegiving something to each
but what i drew from the water by the pondside, that i reserve
i will give of itbut only to them that love as i myself am capable of
loving
footnote  i am favoured with the following indication, from mr whitman
himself, of the relation in which this word calamus is to be
understoodcalamus is the very large and aromatic grass or rush growing
about waterponds in the valleysspears about three feet high often
called sweet flag grows all over the northern and middle states the
recherch or ethereal sense of the term, as used in my book, arises
probably from the actual calamus presenting the biggest and hardiest kind
of spears of grass, and their fresh, aquatic, pungent bouquet
love of comrades

come, i will make the continent indissoluble
i will make the most splendid race the sun ever yet shone upon
i will make divine magnetic lands,
with the love of comrades,
with the lifelong love of comrades

i will plant companionship thick as trees along all the rivers of america,
and along the shores of the great lakes, and all over the prairies
i will make inseparable cities, with their arms about each others necks
by the love of comrades,
by the manly love of comrades

for you these, from me, o democracy, to serve you, ma femme
for you for you, i am trilling these songs,
in the love of comrades,
in the hightowering love of comrades
pulse of my life
not heaving from my ribbed breast only
not in sighs at night, in rage, dissatisfied with myself
not in those longdrawn, illsuppressed sighs
not in many an oath and promise broken
not in my wilful and savage souls volition
not in the subtle nourishment of the air
not in this beating and pounding at my temples and wrists
not in the curious systole and diastole within, which will one day cease
not in many a hungry wish, told to the skies only
not in cries, laughter, defiances, thrown from me when alone, far in the
wilds
not in husky pantings through clenched teeth
not in sounded and resounded wordschattering words, echoes, dead words
not in the murmurs of my dreams while i sleep,
nor the other murmurs of these incredible dreams of every day
nor in the limbs and senses of my body, that take you and dismiss you
continuallynot there
not in any or all of them, o adhesiveness o pulse of my life
need i that you exist and show yourself, any more than in these songs
auxiliaries
what place is besieged, and vainly tries to raise the siege?
lo i send to that place a commander, swift, brave, immortal
and with him horse and foot, and parks of artillery,
and artillerymen, the deadliest that ever fired gun
realities

as i walk, solitary, unattended,
around me i hear that clat of the worldpolitics, produce,
the announcements of recognised thingsscience,
the approved growth of cities, and the spread of inventions
i see the ships, they will last a few years,
the vast factories, with their foremen and workmen,
and hear the endorsement of all, and do not object to it

but i too announce solid things
science, ships, politics, cities, factories, are not nothingthey serve,
they stand for realitiesall is as it should be

then my realities
what else is so real as mine?
libertad, and the divine averagefreedom to every slave on the face of the
earth,
the rapt promises and lumin of seersthe spiritual
worldthese centurieslasting songs,
and our visions, the visions of poets, the most solid announcements of any
for we support all,
after the rest is done and gone, we remain,
there is no final reliance but upon us
democracy rests finally upon us, i, my brethren, begin it,
and our visions sweep through eternity
footnote  i suppose whitman gets this odd word lumin, by a process of
his own, out of illuminati, and intends it to stand for what would be
called clairvoyance, intuition
nearing departure

as nearing departure,
as the time draws nigh, glooming, a cloud,
a dread beyond, of i know not what, darkens me

i shall go forth,
i shall traverse the statesbut i cannot tell whither or how long
perhaps soon, some day or night while i am singing, my voice will suddenly
cease

o book and chant must all then amount to but this?
must we barely arrive at this beginning of me?
and yet it is enough, o soul
o soul we have positively appearedthat is enough
poets to come

poets to come
not today is to justify me, and democracy, and what we are for
but you, a new brood, native, athletic, continental, greater than before
known,
you must justify me

i but write one or two indicative words for the future,
i but advance a moment, only to wheel and hurry back in the darkness
i am a man who, sauntering along, without fully stopping, turns a casual
look upon you, and then averts his face,
leaving it to you to prove and define it,
expecting the main things from you
centuries hence
full of life now, compact, visible,
i, forty years old the eightythird year of the states,
to one a century hence, or any number of centuries hence,
to you, yet unborn, these seeking you
when you read these, i, that was visible, am become invisible
now it is you, compact, visible, realising my poems, seeking me
fancying how happy you were, if i could be with you, and become your loving
comrade
be it as if i were with you be not too certain but i am now with you
so long

to concludei announce what comes after me
i announce mightier offspring, orators, days, and then depart,
i remember i said, before my leaves sprang at all,
i would raise my voice jocund and strong, with reference to consummations
when america does what was promised,
when there are plentiful athletic bards, inland and seaboard,
when through these states walk a hundred millions of superb persons,
when the rest part away for superb persons, and contribute to them,
when breeds of the most perfect mothers denote america,
then to me my due fruition
i have pressed through in my own right,
i have offered my style to every onei have journeyed with confident step
while my pleasure is yet at the full, i whisper, so long
and take the young womans hand, and the young mans hand for the last
time

i announce natural persons to arise,
i announce justice triumphant,
i announce uncompromising liberty and equality,
i announce the justification of candour, and the justification of pride
i announce that the identity of these states is a single identity only,
i announce the union, out of all its struggles and wars, more and more
compact,
i announce splendours and majesties to make all the previous politics of
the earth insignificant
i announce a man or woman comingperhaps you are the one so long
i announce the great individual, fluid as nature, chaste, affectionate,
compassionate, fully armed
i announce a life that shall be copious, vehement, spiritual, bold,
and i announce an old age that shall lightly and joyfully meet its
translation

o thicker and faster so long
o crowding too close upon me
i foresee too muchit means more than i thought,
it appears to me i am dying
hasten throat, and sound your last
salute mesalute the days once more peal the old cry once more
screaming electric, the atmosphere using,
at random glancing, each as i notice absorbing,
swiftly on, but a little while alighting,
curious enveloped messages delivering,
sparkles hot, seed ethereal, down in the dirt dropping,
myself unknowing, my commission obeying, to question it never daring,
to ages, and ages yet, the growth of the seed leaving,
to troops out of me risingthey the tasks i have set promulging,
to women certain whispers of myself bequeathingtheir affection me more
clearly explaining,
to young men my problems offeringno dallier ii the muscle of their
brains trying,
so i passa little time vocal, visible, contrary,
afterward, a melodious echo, passionately bent fordeath making me really
undying,
the best of me then when no longer visiblefor toward that i have been
incessantly preparing
what is there more, that i lag and pause, and crouch extended with unshut
mouth?
is there a single final farewell?

my songs ceasei abandon them,
from behind the screen where i hid, i advance personally, solely to you
camerado this is no book
who touches this touches a man
is it night? are we here alone?
it is i you hold, and who holds you,
i spring from the pages into your armsdecease calls me forth
o how your fingers drowse me
your breath falls around me like dewyour pulse lulls the tympans of my
ears,
i feel immerged from head to foot,
deliciousenough
enough, o deed impromptu and secret
enough, o gliding present enough, o summedup past

dear friend, whoever you are, here, take this kiss,
i give it especially to youdo not forget me,
i feel like one who has done his worki progress on,long enough have i
dallied with life,
the unknown sphere, more real than i dreamed, more direct, awakening rays
about meso long
remember my wordsi love youi depart from materials,
i am as one disembodied, triumphant, dead
