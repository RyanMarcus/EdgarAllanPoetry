 
nce upon a midnight dreary, while  pondered, weak and weary,
ver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore--
hile  nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
s of some one gently rapping--rapping at my chamber door
is some visitor,  muttered, tapping at my chamber door--
nly this and nothing more
h, distinctly  remember, it was in the bleak ecember,
nd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
agerly  wished the morrow--vainly  had sought to borrow
rom my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost enore--
or the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name enore--
ameless here for evermore
nd the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
hrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before
o that now, to still the beating of my heart,  stood repeating
is some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door--
ome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door--
his it is and nothing more
resently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer,
ir, said , or adam, truly your forgiveness  implore
ut the fact is  was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
nd so faintly you came tapping--tapping at my chamber door,
hat  scarce was sure  heard you--here  opened wide the door--
arkness there and nothing more
eep into that darkness peering, long  stood there wondering,
fearing,
oubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before
ut the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,
nd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, enore
his  whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, enore
erely this and nothing more
ack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
oon  heard again a tapping, somewhat louder than before
urely, said , surely that is something at my window lattice
et me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore--
et my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore--
is the wind and nothing more
pen here  flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
n there stepped a stately aven of the saintly days of yore
ot the least obeisance made he not an instant stopped or stayed he
ut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--
erched upon a bust of allas just above my chamber door--
erched, and sat, and nothing more
hen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
y the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
hough thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,  said, art sure no
craven,
hastly grim and ancient aven wandering from the ightly shore--
ell me what thy lordly name is on the ights lutonian shore
uoth the aven, evermore
uch  marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
hough its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore
or we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
ver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--
ird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
ith such name as evermore
ut the aven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only
hat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour
othing further then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered--
ill  scarcely more than muttered, ther friends have flown before--
n the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before
hen the bird said, evermore
tartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
oubtless, said , what it utters is its only stock and store,
aught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful isaster
ollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore--
ill the dirges of his ope the melancholy burden bore
f ever--nevermore
ut the aven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
traight  wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and
door
hen, upon the velvet sinking,  betook myself to linking
ancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--
hat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
eant in croaking evermore
his  sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
o the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms core
his and more  sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
n the cushions velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated oer,
ut whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating oer,
he shall press, ah, nevermore
hen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
wung by eraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor
retch,  cried, thy od hath lent thee--by these angels he hath
sent thee
espite--respite aad nepenth from thy memories of enore
uaff, oh quaff this kind nepenth, and forget this lost enore
uoth the aven, evermore
rophet said , thing of evil--prophet still, if bird or devil--
hether empter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
esolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--
n this home by orror haunted--tell me truly,  implore--
s there--is there balm in ilead?--tell me--tell me,  implore
uoth the aven, evermore
rophet said , thing of evil--prophet still, if bird or devil
y that eaven that bends above us--by that od we both adore--
ell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant idenn,
t shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name enore--
lasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name enore
uoth the aven, evermore
e that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend  shrieked,
upstarting--
et thee back into the tempest and the ights lutonian shore
eave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken
eave my loneliness unbroken--quit the bust above my door
ake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door
uoth the aven, evermore
nd the aven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
n the pallid bust of allas just above my chamber door
nd his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming,
nd the lamp-light oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor
nd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
hall be lifted--nevermore

t was night in the lonesome ctober
f my most immemorial year
t was hard by the dim lake of uber,

t the end of our path a liquescent
nd nebulous lustre was born,
ut of which a miraculous crescent
rose with a duplicate horn--

istinct with its duplicate horn

 saw thee once--once only--years ago
 must not say how many--but not many
t was a uly midnight and from out
 full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring,
ought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,
here fell a silvery-silken veil of light,
ith quietude, and sultriness and slumber,
pon the upturnd faces of a thousand
oses that grew in an enchanted garden,
here no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe--
ell on the upturnd faces of these roses
hat gave out, in return for the love-light,
heir odorous souls in an ecstatic death--
ell on the upturnd faces of these roses
hat smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted
y thee, and by the poetry of thy presence
lad all in white, upon a violet bank
 saw thee half-reclining while the moon
ell on the upturnd faces of the roses,
nd on thine own, upturnd--alas, in sorrow
as it not ate, that, on this uly midnight--
as it not ate whose name is also orrow,
hat bade me pause before that garden-gate,
o breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?
o footstep stirred the hated world all slept,
ave only thee and me-- eaven-- od
ow my heart beats in coupling those two words--
ave only thee and me  paused-- looked--
nd in an instant all things disappeared
h, bear in mind this garden was enchanted
he pearly lustre of the moon went out
he mossy banks and the meandering paths,
he happy flowers and the repining trees,
ere seen no more the very roses odors
ied in the arms of the adoring airs
ll--all expired save thee--save less than thou
ave only the divine light in thine eyes--
ave but the soul in thine uplifted eyes
 saw but them--they were the world to me
 saw but them--saw only them for hours--
aw only them until the moon went down
hat wild heart-histories seemed to lie unwritten
pon those crystalline, celestial spheres
ow dark a woe yet how sublime a hope
ow silently serene a sea of pride
ow daring an ambition yet how deep--
ow fathomless a capacity for love
ut now, at length, dear ian sank from sight,
nto a western couch of thunder-cloud
nd thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees
idst glide away nly thine eyes remained
hey would not go--they never yet have gone
ighting my lonely pathway home that night,
hey have not left me as my hopes have since
hey follow me--they lead me through the years
hey are my ministers--yet  their slave
heir office is to illumine and enkindle--
y duty, to be saved by their bright light,
nd purified in their electric fire,
nd sanctified in their elysian fire
hey fill my soul with eauty which is ope,
nd are far up in eaven--the stars  kneel to
n the sad, silent watches of my night
hile even in the meridian glare of day
 see them still--two sweetly scintillant
enuses, unextinguished by the sun
                            
 
t was many and many a year ago,
n a kingdom by the sea,
hat a maiden there lived whom you may know
y the name of  
nd this maiden she lived with no other thought
han to love and be loved by me
 was a child and she was a child,
n this kingdom by the sea
ut we loved with a love that was more than love--
 and my  
ith a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
oveted her and me
nd this was the reason that, long ago,
n this kingdom by the sea,
 wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
y beautiful  
o that her highborn kinsmen came
nd bore her away from me,
o shut her up in a sepulchre
n this kingdom by the sea
he angels, not half so happy in heaven,
ent envying her and me--
es--that was the reason as all men know,
n this kingdom by the sea
hat the wind came out of the cloud by night,
hilling and killing my  
ut our love it was stronger by far than the love
f those who were older than we--
f many far wiser than we--
nd neither the angels in heaven above,
or the demons down under the sea,
an ever dissever my soul from the soul
f the beautiful  
or the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
f the beautiful  
nd the stars never rise but  see the bright eyes
f the beautiful  
nd so, all the night-tide,  lie down by the side
f my darling, my darling, my life and my bride,
n her sepulchre there by the sea--
n her tomb by the side of the sea

eyond the utterance of the human tongue

y angels dreaming in the moonlit dew

ith thy dear name as text, though hidden by thee,

hreshold of the wide-open gate of dreams,

mid empurpled vapors, far away
o where the prospect terminates--thee only

n a strange city lying alone

ave gone to their eternal rest

ime-eaten towers and tremble not
esemble nothing that is ours
round, by lifting winds forgot,
esignedly beneath the sky
he melancholy waters lie
o rays from the holy eaven come down
n the long night-time of that town

nto the universal valley

he lily lolls upon the wave
rapping the fog about its breast,

ooking like ethe, see the lake
 conscious slumber seems to take,
nd would not, for the world, awake
ll eauty sleeps--and lo where lies
er casement open to the skies
rene, with her estinies
h, lady bright can it be right--
his window open to the night
he wanton airs, from the tree-top,
aughingly through the lattice-drop--
he bodiless airs, a wizard rout,
lit through thy chamber in and out,

o fitfully--so fearfully--
bove the closed and fringed lid
eath which thy slumbring soul lies hid,

ike ghosts the shadows rise and fall
h, lady dear, hast thou no fear?
hy and what art thou dreaming here?
ure thou art come oer far-off seas,

trange is thy pallor strange thy dress
trange, above all, thy length of tress,
nd this all-solemn silentness
he lady sleeps h, may her sleep
hich is enduring, so be deep
eaven have her in its sacred keep
his chamber changed for one more holy,
his bed for one more melancholy,
 pray to od that she may lie
or ever with unopened eye,
hile the dim sheeted ghosts go by
y love, she sleeps h, may her sleep,
s it is lasting, so be deep
oft may the worms about her creep
ar in the forest, dim and old,
or her may some tall vault unfold--
ome vault that oft hath flung its black
nd winged panels fluttering back,
riumphant, oer the crested palls,
f her grand family funerals--
ome sepulchre, remote, alone,
gainst whose portal she hath thrown,
n childhood many an idle stone--
ome tomb from out whose sounding door
he neer shall force an echo more,
hrilling to think, poor child of sin
t was the dead who groaned within

re all at my command
nd  am happy now
nd my lord he loves me well
ut, when first he breathed his vow,
 felt my bosom swell--
or the words rang as a knell,
nd the voice seemed his who fell
n the battle down the dell,
nd who is happy now
ut he spoke to reassure me,
nd he kissed my pallid brow,
hile a reverie came oer me,
nd to the churchyard bore me,
nd  sighed to him before me,
hinking him dead lormie,
h,  am happy now
nd thus the words were spoken,
nd thus the plighted vow,
nd, though my faith be broken,
nd, though my heart be broken,
ehold the golden keys
hat proves me happy now
ould to od  could awaken
or  dream  know not how,
nd my soul is sorely shaken
est an evil step be taken,--
est the dead who is forsaken

-- adys partment, with a window open and looking into a garden
, in deep mourning, reading at a table on which lie some books and
a hand-mirror n the background  a servant maid leans
carelessly upon a chair

acinta

acinta seats herself in a side-long manner upon the chair, resting
her elbows upon the back, and regarding her mistress with a contemptuous
look alage continues to read

ore a bright golden flower, but not i this soil

o lingering winters there, nor snow, nor shower--

h, beautiful--most beautiful--how like
o what my fevered soul doth dream of eaven
 happy land pauses he died--the maiden died
 still more happy maiden who couldst die
acinta
acinta returns no answer, and alage presently resumes
gain--a similar tale
old of a beauteous dame beyond the sea
hus speaketh one erdinand in the words of the play--
he died full young--one ossola answers him--
 think not so--her infelicity
eemed to have years too many--h, luckless lady
acinta still no answer
eres a far sterner story--

ow should he love thee? or how deem thee wise,
ho wouldst not leave him in his wandering
o seek for treasure in the jewelled skies,

ast thou not dragged iana from her car?

o seek a shelter in some happier star?
ast thou not torn the aiad from her flood,

o distant spheres, from time to time, she rode,
nd late to ours, the favourd one of od--
ut, now, the ruler of an anchord realm,

eliriously sweet, was droppd from eaven,

he fears to perfume, perfuming the night
nd lytia  pondering between many a sun,

f rosy head, that towering far away
nto the sunlit ether, caught the ray
f sunken suns at eve--at noon of night,

f gorgeous columns on th uuburthend air,
lashing from arian marble that twin smile
ar down upon the wave that sparkled there,
nd nursled the young mountain in its lair
f molten stars their pavement, such as fall 
hro the ebon air, besilvering the pall
f their own dissolution, while they die--
dorning then the dwellings of the sky

at gently on these columns as a crown--
 window of one circular diamond, there,
ookd out above into the purple air
nd rays from od shot down that meteor chain
nd hallowd all the beauty twice again,

hat stealeth ever on the ear of him
ho, musing, gazeth on the distance dim,
nd sees the darkness coming as a cloud--

ut what is this?--it cometh--and it brings
 music with it--tis the rush of wings--

rom the wild energy of wanton haste
er cheeks were flushing, and her lips apart

ad burst beneath the heaving of her heart
ithin the centre of that hall to breathe

nd longd to rest, yet could but sparkle there
oung flowers were whispering in melody 
o happy flowers that night--and tree to tree

n many a star-lit grove, or moon-light dell
et silence came upon material things--

nd sound alone that from the spirit sprang
ore burthen to the charm the maiden sang
eath blue-bell or streamer--

eraphs in all but nowledge, the keen light
hat fell, refracted, thro thy bounds afar,
 death from eye of od upon that star

o them twere the imoom, and would destroy--
or what to them availeth it to know

ith the last ecstasy of satiate life--
eyond that death no immortality--
ut sleep that pondereth and is not to be--
nd there--oh may my weary spirit dwell--

hat guilty spirit, in what shrubbery dim

ut two they fell for heaven no grace imparts
o those who hear not for their beating hearts
 maiden-angel and her seraph-lover--
 where and ye may seek the wide skies over
as ove, the blind, near sober uty known?
nguided ove hath fallen--mid tears of perfect moan 
e was a goodly spirit--he who fell
 wanderer by mossy-mantled well--
 gazer on the lights that shine above--
 dreamer in the moonbeam by his love
hat wonder? for each star is eye-like there,
nd looks so sweetly down on eautys hair--
nd they, and evry mossy spring were holy
o his love-haunted heart and melancholy
he night had found to him a night of wo
pon a mountain crag, young ngelo--
eetling it bends athwart the solemn sky,
nd scowls on starry worlds that down beneath it lie
ere sate he with his love--his dark eye bent
ith eagle gaze along the firmament
ow turnd it upon her--but ever then
t trembled to the orb of  again
anthe, dearest, see how dim that ray
ow lovely tis to look so far away
he seemed not thus upon that autumn eve
 left her gorgeous halls--nor mourned to leave,
hat eve--that eve-- should remember well--
he sun-ray dropped, in emnos with a spell
n th rabesque carving of a gilded hall
herein  sate, and on the draperied wall--
nd on my eyelids--, the heavy light
ow drowsily it weighed them into night
n flowers, before, and mist, and love they ran
ith ersian aadi in his ulistan
ut , that light-- slumbered--eath, the while,
tole oer my senses in that lovely isle
o softly that no single silken hair
woke that slept--or knew that he was there
he last spot of arths orb  trod upon
as a proud temple called the arthenon 
ore beauty clung around her columned wall
hen even thy glowing bosom beats withal, 
nd when old ime my wing did disenthral
hence sprang --as the eagle from his tower,
nd years  left behind me in an hour
hat time upon her airy bounds  hung,
ne half the garden of her globe was flung
nrolling as a chart unto my view--
enantless cities of the desert too
anthe, beauty crowded on me then,
nd half  wished to be again of men
y ngelo and why of them to be?
 brighter dwelling-place is here for thee--
nd greener fields than in yon world above,
nd womans loveliness--and passionate love
ut list, anthe when the air so soft
ailed, as my pennoned spirit leapt aloft, 
erhaps my brain grew dizzy--but the world
 left so late was into chaos hurled,
prang from her station, on the winds apart,
nd rolled a flame, the fiery eaven athwart
ethought, my sweet one, then  ceased to soar,
nd fell--not swiftly as  rose before,
ut with a downward, tremulous motion thro
ight, brazen rays, this golden star unto
or long the measure of my falling hours,
or nearest of all stars was thine to ours--
read star that came, amid a night of mirth,
 red aedalion on the timid arth
e came--and to thy arth--but not to us
e given our ladys bidding to discuss
e came, my love around, above, below,
ay fire-fly of the night we come and go,
or ask a reason save the angel-nod
he grants to us as granted by her od--
ut, ngelo, than thine gray ime unfurled
ever his fairy wing oer fairer world
im was its little disk, and angel eyes
lone could see the phantom in the skies,
hen first l araaf knew her course to be
eadlong thitherward oer the starry sea--
ut when its glory swelled upon the sky,
s glowing eautys bust beneath mans eye,
e paused before the heritage of men,
nd thy star trembled--as doth eauty then
hus in discourse, the lovers whiled away
he night that waned and waned and brought no day
hey fell for eaven to them no hope imparts
ho hear not for the beating of their hearts
ind solace in a dying hour
uch, father, is not now my theme--
 will not madly deem that power
f arth may shrive me of the sin
nearthly pride hath revelled in--
 have no time to dote or dream
ou call it hope--that fire of fire
t is but agony of desire
f  can hope-- od  can--
ts fount is holier--more divine--
 would not call thee fool, old man,
ut such is not a gift of thine
now thou the secret of a spirit
owed from its wild pride into shame

hy withering portion with the fame,
he searing glory which hath shone
mid the ewels of my throne,
alo of ell and with a pain
ot ell shall make me fear again--

nd sunshine of my summer hours
he undying voice of that dead time,
ith its interminable chime,

ath not the same fierce heirdom given

nd a proud spirit which hath striven

ightly their dews upon my head,
nd,  believe, the winged strife
nd tumult of the headlong air

id dreams of an unholy night

hile the red flashing of the light
rom clouds that hung, like banners, oer,

nd the deep trumpet-thunders roar
ame hurriedly upon me, telling
f human battle, where my voice,
y own voice, silly child--was swelling
 how my spirit would rejoice,
nd leap within me at the cry
he battle-cry of ictory
he rain came down upon my head
nsheltered--and the heavy wind
endered me mad and deaf and blind
t was but man,  thought, who shed
aurels upon me and the rush--
he torrent of the chilly air
urgled within my ear the crush
f empires--with the captives prayer--
he hum of suitors--and the tone
f flattery round a sovereigns throne
y passions, from that hapless hour,
surped a tyranny which men
ave deemed since  have reached to power,
y innate nature--be it so
ut, father, there lived one who, then,
hen--in my boyhood--when their fire
urned with a still intenser glow
or passion must, with youth, expire
en then who knew this iron heart
n womans weakness had a part
 have no words--alas--to tell
he loveliness of loving well
or would  now attempt to trace
he more than beauty of a face
hose lineaments, upon my mind,

ith loitering eye, till  have felt
he letters--with their meaning--melt
o fantasies--with none
, she was worthy of all love
ove as in infancy was mine--
was such as angel minds above
ight envy her young heart the shrine
n which my every hope and thought
ere incense--then a goodly gift,
or they were childish and upright--
ure--as her young example taught
hy did  leave it, and, adrift,
rust to the fire within, for light?
e grew in age--and love--together--
oaming the forest, and the wild
y breast her shield in wintry weather--
nd, when the friendly sunshine smiled
nd she would mark the opening skies,
 saw no eaven--but in her eyes
oung oves first lesson is----the heart
or mid that sunshine, and those smiles,
hen, from our little cares apart,
nd laughing at her girlish wiles,
d throw me on her throbbing breast,
nd pour my spirit out in tears--
here was no need to speak the rest--
o need to quiet any fears
f her--who asked no reason why,
ut turned on me her quiet eye
et more than worthy of the love
y spirit struggled with, and strove
hen, on the mountain peak, alone,

 had no being--but in thee

n the earth--the air--the sea--

hat was new pleasure--the ideal,
im, vanities of dreams by night--
nd dimmer nothings which were real--
hadows--and a more shadowy light
arted upon their misty wings,
nd, so, confusedly, became
hine image and--a name--a name
wo separate--yet most intimate things

e walked together on the crown
f a high mountain which looked down
far from its proud natural towers
f rock and forest, on the hills--
he dwindled hills begirt with bowers
nd shouting with a thousand rills
 spoke to her of power and pride,
ut mystically--in such guise
hat she might deem it nought beside

 mingled feeling with my own--
he flush on her bright cheek, to me
eemed to become a queenly throne
oo well that  should let it be
ight in the wilderness alone

nd donned a visionary crown--
et it was not that antasy

o him who still would look upon

o those whose spirits hearken as one

o like you gather in your breath

nd boyhood is a summer sun
hose waning is the dreariest one--
or all we live to know is known,
nd all we seek to keep hath flown--
et life, then, as the day-flower, fall
ith the noon-day beauty--which is all

or all had flown who made it so
 passed from out its mossy door,

f one whom  had earlier known--
,  defy thee, ell, to show

rom regions of the blest afar,

ver the magic solitude

hat palpitate like the chill seas
round the misty ebrides
h, by no wind those clouds are driven
hat rustle through the unquiet eaven
nceasingly, from morn till even,
ver the violets there that lie

a musique, says armontel, in those ontes oraux which in all
our translations we have insisted upon calling oral ales, as if in
mockery of their spirit--la musique est le seul des talens qui jouisse
de lui-meme tous les autres veulent des temoins e here confounds
the pleasure derivable from sweet sounds with the capacity for creating
them o more than any other talent, is that for music susceptible of
complete enjoyment where there is no second party to appreciate its
exercise and it is only in common with other talents that it produces
effects which may be fully enjoyed in solitude he idea which the
raconteur has either failed to entertain clearly, or has sacrificed in
its expression to his national love of point, is doubtless the very
tenable one that the higher order of music is the most thoroughly
estimated when we are exclusively alone he proposition in this form
will be admitted at once by those who love the lyre for its own sake and
for its spiritual uses ut there is one pleasure still within the reach
of fallen mortality, and perhaps only one, which owes even more than
does music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion  mean the happiness
experienced in the contemplation of natural scenery n truth, the man
who would behold aright the glory of od upon earth must in solitude
behold that glory o me at least the presence, not of human life only,
but of life, in any other form than that of the green things which grow
upon the soil and are voiceless, is a stain upon the landscape, is at
war with the genius of the scene  love, indeed, to regard the dark
valleys, and the gray rocks, and the waters that silently smile, and the
forests that sigh in uneasy slumbers, and the proud watchful mountains
that look down upon all,-- love to regard these as themselves but the
colossal members of one vast animate and sentient whole--a whole whose
form that of the sphere is the most perfect and most inclusive of all
whose path is among associate planets whose meek handmaiden is the
moon whose mediate sovereign is the sun whose life is eternity whose
thought is that of a god whose enjoyment is knowledge whose destinies
are lost in immensity whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our
own cognizance of the animalcul which infest the brain, a being which
we in consequence regard as purely inanimate and material, much in the
same manner as these animalcul must thus regard us
ur telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on every
hand, notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the priesthood,
that space, and therefore that bulk, is an important consideration in
the eyes of the lmighty he cycles in which the stars move are those
best adapted for the evolution, without collision, of the greatest
possible number of bodies he forms of those bodies are accurately such
as within a given surface to include the greatest possible amount of
matter while the surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodate
a denser population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces
otherwise arranged or is it any argument against bulk being an object
with od that space itself is infinite for there may be an infinity of
matter to fill it and since we see clearly that the endowment of matter
with vitality is a principle--indeed, as far as our judgments extend,
the leading principle in the operations of eity, it is scarcely
logical to imagine it confined to the regions of the minute, where we
daily trace it, and not extending to those of the august s we find
cycle within cycle without end, yet all revolving around one far-distant
centre which is the odhead, may we not analogically suppose, in the
same manner, life within life, the less within the greater, and all
within the pirit ivine? n short, we are madly erring through
self-esteem in believing man, in either his temporal or future
destinies, to be of more moment in the universe than that vast clod of
the valley which he tills and contemns, and to which he denies a soul,
for no more profound reason than that he does not behold it in operation
hese fancies, and such as these, have always given to my meditations
among the mountains and the forests, by the rivers and the ocean, a
tinge of what the every-day world would not fail to term the fantastic
y wanderings amid such scenes have been many and far-searching, and
often solitary and the interest with which  have strayed through many
a dim deep valley, or gazed into the reflected heaven of many a bright
lake, has been an interest greatly deepened by the thought that  have
strayed and gazed alone hat flippant renchman  was it who said,
in allusion to the well known work of immermann, that la solitude est
une belle chose mais il faut quelquun pour vous dire que la solitude
est une belle chose? he epigram cannot be gainsaid but the necessity
is a thing that does not exist
t was during one of my lonely journeyings, amid a far distant region of
mountain locked within mountain, and sad rivers and melancholy tarns
writhing or sleeping within all, that  chanced upon a certain rivulet
and island  came upon them suddenly in the leafy une, and threw
myself upon the turf beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub,
that  might doze as  contemplated the scene  felt that thus only
should  look upon it, such was the character of phantasm which it wore
n all sides, save to the west where the sun was about sinking, arose
the verdant walls of the forest he little river which turned sharply
in its course, and was thus immediately lost to sight, seemed to have no
exit from its prison, but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage of
the trees to the east while in the opposite quarter so it appeared to
me as  lay at length and glanced upward there poured down noiselessly
and continuously into the valley a rich golden and crimson waterfall
from the sunset fountains of the sky
bout midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in, one
small circular island, profusely verdured, reposed upon the bosom of the
stream
o blended bank and shadow there,
hat each seemed pendulous in air--
so mirror-like was the glassy water, that it was scarcely possible to
say at what point upon the slope of the emerald turf its crystal
dominion began y position enabled me to include in a single view both
the eastern and western extremities of the islet, and  observed a
singularly-marked difference in their aspects he latter was all one
radiant harem of garden beauties t glowed and blushed beneath the eye
of the slant sunlight, and fairly laughed with flowers he grass was
short, springy, sweet-scented, and sphodel-interspersed he trees were
lithe, mirthful, erect, bright, slender, and graceful, of eastern figure
and foliage, with bark smooth, glossy, and parti-colored here seemed a
deep sense of life and joy about all, and although no airs blew from out
the heavens, yet everything had motion through the gentle sweepings to
and fro of innumerable butterflies, that might have been mistaken for
tulips with wings 
he other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest shade
 sombre, yet beautiful and peaceful gloom, here pervaded all things
he trees were dark in color and mournful in form and attitude--
wreathing themselves into sad, solemn, and spectral shapes, that
conveyed ideas of mortal sorrow and untimely death he grass wore the
deep tint of the cypress, and the heads of its blades hung droopingly,
and hither and thither among it were many small unsightly hillocks, low
and narrow, and not very long, that had the aspect of graves, but were
not, although over and all about them the rue and the rosemary
clambered he shades of the trees fell heavily upon the water, and
seemed to bury itself therein, impregnating the depths of the element
with darkness  fancied that each shadow, as the sun descended lower
and lower, separated itself sullenly from the trunk that gave it birth,
and thus became absorbed by the stream, while other shadows issued
momently from the trees, taking the place of their predecessors thus
entombed
his idea having once seized upon my fancy greatly excited it, and 
lost myself forthwith in reverie f ever island were enchanted, said
 to myself, this is it his is the haunt of the few gentle ays who
remain from the wreck of the race re these green tombs theirs?--or do
they yield up their sweet lives as mankind yield up their own? n dying,
do they not rather waste away mournfully, rendering unto od little by
little their existence, as these trees render up shadow after shadow,
exhausting their substance unto dissolution? hat the wasting tree is to
the water that imbibes its shade, growing thus blacker by what it preys
upon, may not the life of the ay be to the death which engulfs it?
s  thus mused, with half-shut eyes, while the sun sank rapidly to
rest, and eddying currents careered round and round the island, bearing
upon their bosom large dazzling white flakes of the bark of the
sycamore, flakes which, in their multiform positions upon the water, a
quick imagination might have converted into anything it pleased while 
thus mused, it appeared to me that the form of one of those very ays
about whom  had been pondering, made its way slowly into the darkness
from out the light at the western end of the island he stood erect in
a singularly fragile canoe, and urged it with the mere phantom of an
oar hile within the influence of the lingering sunbeams, her attitude
seemed indicative of joy, but sorrow deformed it as she passed within
the shade lowly she glided along, and at length rounded the islet and
re-entered the region of light he revolution which has just been made
by the ay, continued  musingly, is the cycle of the brief year of
her life he has floated through her winter and through her summer he
is a year nearer unto death for  did not fail to see that as she came
into the shade, her shadow fell from her, and was swallowed up in the
dark water, making its blackness more black
nd again the boat appeared and the ay, but about the attitude of the
latter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic joy
he floated again from out the light and into the gloom which deepened
momently, and again her shadow fell from her into the ebony water, and
became absorbed into its blackness nd again and again she made the
circuit of the island while the sun rushed down to his slumbers, and
at each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person,
while it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct, and at each
passage into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade, which became
whelmed in a shadow more black ut at length, when the sun had utterly
departed, the ay, now the mere ghost of her former self, went
disconsolately with her boat into the region of the ebony flood, and
that she issued thence at all  cannot say, for darkness fell over all
things, and  beheld her magical figure no more

appeared to blend into unity?

gathos
here are no dreams in idenn--but it is here whispered that, of this
infinity of matter, the sole purpose is to afford infinite springs
at which the soul may allay the thirst to know which is forever
unquenchable within it--since to quench it would be to extinguish the

triplicate and triple-tinted suns

nd now, gathos, as we proceed, instruct me--speak to me in the
earths familiar tones  understand not what you hinted to me just
now of the modes or of the methods of what during mortality, we were
accustomed to call reation o you mean to say that the reator is

throughout the universe so perpetually springing into being can only
be considered as the mediate or indirect, not as the direct or
immediate results of the ivine creative power
inos
mong men, my gathos, this idea would be considered heretical in the
extreme
gathos
mong the angels, my inos, it is seen to be simply true
inos
 can comprehend you thus far--that certain operations of what we term
ature, or the natural laws, will, under certain conditions, give rise
to that which has all the appearance of creation hortly before the
final overthrow of the earth, there were,  well remember, many very
successful experiments in what some philosophers were weak enough to
denominate the creation of animalcul
gathos
he cases of which you speak were, in fact, instances of the secondary
creation, and of the only species of creation which has ever been
since the first word spoke into existence the first law
inos
re not the starry worlds that, from the abyss of nonentity, burst
hourly forth into the heavens--are not these stars, gathos, the
immediate handiwork of the ing?
gathos
et me endeavor, my inos, to lead you, step by step, to the
conception  intend ou are well aware that, as no thought can
perish, so no act is without infinite result e moved our hands, for
example, when we were dwellers on the earth, and in so doing we gave
vibration to the atmosphere which engirdled it his vibration was
indefinitely extended till it gave impulse to every particle of the
earths air, which thenceforward, and forever, was actuated by the
one movement of the hand his fact the mathematicians of our globe
well knew hey made the special effects, indeed, wrought in the fluid
by special impulses, the subject of exact calculation--so that it
became easy to determine in what precise period an impulse of given
extent would engirdle the orb, and impress forever every atom of the
atmosphere circumambient etrograding, they found no difficulty from
a given effect, under given conditions, in determining the value of
the original impulse ow the mathematicians who saw that the results
of any given impulse were absolutely endless--and who saw that a
portion of these results were accurately traceable through the agency
of algebraic analysis--who saw, too, the facility of the
retrogradation--these men saw, at the same time, that this species of
analysis itself had within itself a capacity for indefinite
progress--that there were no bounds conceivable to its advancement and
applicability, except within the intellect of him who advanced or
applied it ut at this point our mathematicians paused
inos
nd why, gathos, should they have proceeded?
gathos
ecause there were some considerations of deep interest beyond t was
deducible from what they knew, that to a being of infinite
understanding--one to whom the perfection of the algebraic analysis
lay unfolded--there could be no difficulty in tracing every impulse
given the air--and the ether through the air--to the remotest
consequences at any even infinitely remote epoch of time t is indeed
demonstrable that every such impulse given the air, must in the
end impress every individual thing that exists within the
universe--and the being of infinite understanding--the being whom
we have imagined--might trace the remote undulations of the
impulse--trace them upward and onward in their influences upon all
particles of all matter--upward and onward forever in their
modifications of old forms--or, in other words, in their creation of
new--until he found them reflected--unimpressive at last--back from
the throne of the odhead nd not only could such a being do this,
but at any epoch, should a given result be afforded him--should one of
these numberless comets, for example, be presented to his
inspection--he could have no difficulty in determining, by the
analytic retrogradation, to what original impulse it was due his
power of retrogradation in its absolute fulness and perfection--this
faculty of referring at all epochs, all effects to all
causes--is of course the prerogative of the eity alone--but in every
variety of degree, short of the absolute perfection, is the power
itself exercised by the whole host of the ngelic ntelligences
inos
ut you speak merely of impulses upon the air
gathos
n speaking of the air,  referred only to the earth but the general
proposition has reference to impulses upon the ether--which, since it
pervades, and alone pervades all space, is thus the great medium of
creation
inos
hen all motion, of whatever nature, creates?
gathos
t must but a true philosophy has long taught that the source of all
motion is thought--and the source of all thought is--
inos
od
gathos
 have spoken to you, inos, as to a child, of the fair arth which
lately perished--of impulses upon the atmosphere of the earth
inos
ou did
gathos
nd while  thus spoke, did there not cross your mind some thought of
the physical power of words? s not every word an impulse on the
air?
inos
ut why, gathos, do you weep--and why, oh, why do your wings droop as
we hover above this fair star--which is the greenest and yet most
terrible of all we have encountered in our flight? ts brilliant
flowers look like a fairy dream--but its fierce volcanoes like the
passions of a turbulent heart
gathos
hey are--they are--his wild star--it is now three centuries
since, with clasped hands, and with streaming eyes, at the feet of my
beloved-- spoke it--with a few passionate sentences--into birth ts
brilliant flowers are the dearest of all unfulfilled dreams, and its
raging volcanoes are the passions of the most turbulent and
unhallowed of hearts

eyelids with the passionate fingers of love
onos
ne word first, my na, in regard to mans general condition at this
epoch ou will remember that one or two of the wise among our
forefathers--wise in fact, although not in the worlds esteem--had
ventured to doubt the propriety of the term improvement, as applied
to the progress of our civilization here were periods in each of the
five or six centuries immediately preceding our dissolution when arose
some vigorous intellect, boldly contending for those principles whose
truth appears now, to our disenfranchised reason, so utterly obvious
--principles which should have taught our race to submit to the
guidance of the natural laws rather than attempt their control t
long intervals some master-minds appeared, looking upon each advance
in practical science as a retrogradation in the true utility
ccasionally the poetic intellect--that intellect which we now feel to
have been the most exalted of all--since those truths which to us were
of the most enduring importance could only be reached by that
analogy which speaks in proof-tones to the imagination alone, and to
the unaided reason bears no weight--occasionally did this poetic
intellect proceed a step farther in the evolving of the vague idea of
the philosophic, and find in the mystic parable that tells of the tree
of knowledge, and of its forbidden fruit, death-producing, a distinct
intimation that knowledge was not meet for man in the infant condition
of his soul nd these men--the poets--living and perishing amid the
scorn of the utilitarians--of rough pedants, who arrogated to
themselves a title which could have been properly applied only to the
scorned--these men, the poets, pondered piningly, yet not unwisely,
upon the ancient days when our wants were not more simple than our
enjoyments were keen--days when mirth was a word unknown, so
solemnly deep-toned was happiness--holy, august, and blissful days,
blue rivers ran undammed, between hills unhewn, into far forest
solitudes, primeval, odorous, and unexplored et these noble
exceptions from the general misrule served but to strengthen it by
opposition las we had fallen upon the most evil of all our evil
days he great movement--that was the cant term--went on a
diseased commotion, moral and physical rt--the rts--arose supreme,
and once enthroned, cast chains upon the intellect which had elevated
them to power an, because he could not but acknowledge the majesty
of ature, fell into childish exultation at his acquired and
still-increasing dominion over her elements ven while he stalked a
od in his own fancy, an infantine imbecility came over him s might
be supposed from the origin of his disorder, he grew infected with
system, and with abstraction e enwrapped himself in generalities
mong other odd ideas, that of universal equality gained ground and
in the face of analogy and of od--in despite of the loud warning
voice of the laws of gradation so visibly pervading all things in
arth and eaven--wild attempts at an omniprevalent emocracy were
made et this evil sprang necessarily from the leading evil,
nowledge an could not both know and succumb eantime huge smoking
cities arose, innumerable reen leaves shrank before the hot breath
of furnaces he fair face of ature was deformed as with the ravages
of some loathsome disease nd methinks, sweet na, even our
slumbering sense of the forced and of the far-fetched might have
arrested us here ut now it appears that we had worked out our own
destruction in the perversion of our taste, or rather in the blind
neglect of its culture in the schools or, in truth, it was at this
crisis that taste alone--that faculty which, holding a middle position
between the pure intellect and the moral sense, could never safely
have been disregarded--it was now that taste alone could have led us
gently back to eauty, to ature, and to ife ut alas for the pure
contemplative spirit and majestic intuition of lato las for the
reek mousichae  which he justly regarded as an all-sufficient
education for the soul las for him and for it--since both were most
desperately needed, when both were most entirely forgotten or despised
 ascal, a philosopher whom we both love, has said, how
truly--ue tout notre raisonnement se rduit  cder au
sentiment and it is not impossible that the sentiment of the
natural, had time permitted it, would have regained its old ascendency
over the harsh mathematical reason of the schools ut this thing was
not to be rematurely induced by intemperance of knowledge, the old
age of the world drew near his the mass of mankind saw not, or,
living lustily although unhappily, affected not to see ut, for
myself, the arths records had taught me to look for widest ruin as
the price of highest civilization  had imbibed a prescience of our
ate from comparison of hina the simple and enduring, with ssyria
the architect, with gypt the astrologer, with ubia, more crafty than
either, the turbulent mother of all rts n the history of these
regions  met with a ray from the uture he individual
artificialities of the three latter were local diseases of the arth,
and in their individual overthrows we had seen local remedies applied
but for the infected world at large  could anticipate no regeneration
save in death hat man, as a race, should not become extinct,  saw
that he must be born again
nd now it was, fairest and dearest, that we wrapped our spirits,
daily, in dreams ow it was that, in twilight, we discoursed of the
days to come, when the rt-scarred surface of the arth, having
undergone that purification which alone could efface its rectangular
obscenities, should clothe itself anew in the verdure and the
mountain-slopes and the smiling waters of aradise, and be rendered at
length a fit dwelling-place for man--for man the eath-purged--for
man to whose now exalted intellect there should be poison in knowledge
no more--for the redeemed, regenerated, blissful, and now immortal,
but still for the material, man
na
ell do  remember these conversations, dear onos but the epoch of
the fiery overthrow was not so near at hand as we believed, and as the
corruption you indicate did surely warrant us in believing en lived
and died individually ou yourself sickened, and passed into the
grave and thither your constant na speedily followed you nd though
the century which has since elapsed, and whose conclusion brings up
together once more, tortured our slumbering senses with no impatience
of duration, yet my onos, it was a century still
onos
ay, rather, a point in the vague infinity nquestionably, it was in
the arths dotage that  died earied at heart with anxieties which
had their origin in the general turmoil and decay,  succumbed to the
fierce fever fter some few days of pain, and many of dreamy delirium
replete with ecstasy, the manifestations of which you mistook for
pain, while  longed but was impotent to undeceive you--after some
days there came upon me, as you have said, a breathless and motionless
torpor and this was termed eath by those who stood around me
ords are vague things y condition did not deprive me of sentience
t appeared to me not greatly dissimilar to the extreme quiescence of
him, who, having slumbered long and profoundly, lying motionless and
fully prostrate in a mid-summer noon, begins to steal slowly back into
consciousness, through the mere sufficiency of his sleep, and without
being awakened by external disturbances
 breathed no longer he pulses were still he heart had ceased to
beat olition had not departed, but was powerless he senses were
unusually active, although eccentrically so--assuming often each
others functions at random he taste and the smell were inextricably
confounded, and became one sentiment, abnormal and intense he
rose-water with which your tenderness had moistened my lips to the
last, affected me with sweet fancies of flowers--fantastic flowers,
far more lovely than any of the old arth, but whose prototypes we
have here blooming around us he eye-lids, transparent and bloodless,
offered no complete impediment to vision s volition was in abeyance,
the balls could not roll in their sockets--but all objects within the
range of the visual hemisphere were seen with more or less
distinctness the rays which fell upon the external retina, or into
the corner of the eye, producing a more vivid effect than those which
struck the front or interior surface et, in the former instance,
this effect was so far anomalous that  appreciated it only as
sound--sound sweet or discordant as the matters presenting
themselves at my side were light or dark in shade--curved or angular
in outline he hearing, at the same time, although excited in degree,
was not irregular in action--estimating real sounds with an
extravagance of precision, not less than of sensibility ouch had
undergone a modification more peculiar ts impressions were tardily
received, but pertinaciously retained, and resulted always in the
highest physical pleasure hus the pressure of your sweet fingers
upon my eyelids, at first only recognized through vision, at length,
long after their removal, filled my whole being with a sensual delight
immeasurable  say with a sensual delight ll my perceptions were
purely sensual he materials furnished the passive brain by the
senses were not in the least degree wrought into shape by the deceased
understanding f pain there was some little of pleasure there was
much but of moral pain or pleasure none at all hus your wild sobs
floated into my ear with all their mournful cadences, and were
appreciated in their every variation of sad tone but they were soft
musical sounds and no more they conveyed to the extinct reason no
intimation of the sorrows which gave them birth while large and
constant tears which fell upon my face, telling the bystanders of a
heart which broke, thrilled every fibre of my frame with ecstasy
alone nd this was in truth the eath of which these bystanders
spoke reverently, in low whispers--you, sweet na, gaspingly, with
loud cries
hey attired me for the coffin--three or four dark figures which
flitted busily to and fro s these crossed the direct line of my
vision they affected me as forms but upon passing to my side their
images impressed me with the idea of shrieks, groans, and, other
dismal expressions of terror, of horror, or of woe ou alone, habited
in a white robe, passed in all directions musically about
he day waned and, as its light faded away,  became possessed by a
vague uneasiness--an anxiety such as the sleeper feels when sad real
sounds fall continuously within his ear--low distant bell-tones,
solemn, at long but equal intervals, and commingling with melancholy
dreams ight arrived and with its shadows a heavy discomfort t
oppressed my limbs with the oppression of some dull weight, and was
palpable here was also a moaning sound, not unlike the distant
reverberation of surf, but more continuous, which, beginning with the
first twilight, had grown in strength with the darkness uddenly
lights were brought into the rooms, and this reverberation became
forthwith interrupted into frequent unequal bursts of the same sound,
but less dreary and less distinct he ponderous oppression was in a
great measure relieved and, issuing from the flame of each lamp for
there were many, there flowed unbrokenly into my ears a strain of
melodious monotone nd when now, dear na, approaching the bed upon
which  lay outstretched, you sat gently by my side, breathing odor
from your sweet lips, and pressing them upon my brow, there arose
tremulously within my bosom, and mingling with the merely physical
sensations which circumstances had called forth, a something akin to
sentiment itself--a feeling that, half appreciating, half responded
to your earnest love and sorrow but this feeling took no root in the
pulseless heart, and seemed indeed rather a shadow than a reality, and
faded quickly away, first into extreme quiescence, and then into a
purely sensual pleasure as before
nd now, from the wreck and the chaos of the usual senses, there
appeared to have arisen within me a sixth, all perfect n its
exercise  found a wild delight--yet a delight still physical,
inasmuch as the understanding had in it no part otion in the animal
frame had fully ceased o muscle quivered no nerve thrilled no
artery throbbed ut there seemed to have sprung up in the brain
that of which no words could convey to the merely human intelligence
even an indistinct conception et me term it a mental pendulous
pulsation t was the moral embodiment of mans abstract idea of
ime y the absolute equalization of this movement--or of such as
this--had the cycles of the firmamental orbs themselves been adjusted
y its aid  measured the irregularities of the clock upon the mantel,
and of the watches of the attendants heir tickings came sonorously
to my ears he slightest deviations from the true proportion--and
these deviations were omniprevalent--affected me just as violations of
abstract truth were wont on earth to affect the moral sense lthough
no two of the timepieces in the chamber struck the individual seconds
accurately together, yet  had no difficulty in holding steadily in
mind the tones, and the respective momentary errors of each nd
this--this keen, perfect self-existing sentiment of duration--this
sentiment existing as man could not possibly have conceived it to
exist independently of any succession of events--this idea--this
sixth sense, upspringing from the ashes of the rest, was the first
obvious and certain step of the intemporal soul upon the threshold of
the temporal eternity
t was midnight and you still sat by my side ll others had departed
from the chamber of eath hey had deposited me in the coffin he
lamps burned flickeringly for this  knew by the tremulousness of the
monotonous strains ut suddenly these strains diminished in
distinctness and in volume inally they ceased he perfume in my
nostrils died away orms affected my vision no longer he oppression
of the arkness uplifted itself from my bosom  dull shot like that
of electricity pervaded my frame, and was followed by total loss of
the idea of contact ll of what man has termed sense was merged in
the sole consciousness of entity, and in the one abiding sentiment of
duration he mortal body had been at length stricken with the hand of
the deadly ecay
et had not all of sentience departed for the consciousness and the
sentiment remaining supplied some of its functions by a lethargic
intuition  appreciated the direful change now in operation upon the
flesh, and, as the dreamer is sometimes aware of the bodily presence
of one who leans over him, so, sweet na,  still dully felt that you
sat by my side o, too, when the noon of the second day came,  was
not unconscious of those movements which displaced you from my side,
which confined me within the coffin, which deposited me within the
hearse, which bore me to the grave, which lowered me within it, which
heaped heavily the mould upon me, and which thus left me, in blackness
and corruption, to my sad and solemn slumbers with the worm
nd here in the prison-house which has few secrets to disclose, there
rolled away days and weeks and months and the soul watched narrowly
each second as it flew, and, without effort, took record of its
flight--without effort and without object
 year passed he consciousness of being had grown hourly more
indistinct, and that of mere locality had in great measure usurped
its position he idea of entity was becoming merged in that of
place he narrow space immediately surrounding what had been the
body was now growing to be the body itself t length, as often
happens to the sleeper by sleep and its world alone is eath
imaged--at length, as sometimes happened on arth to the deep
slumberer, when some flitting light half startled him into awaking,
yet left him half enveloped in dreams--so to me, in the strict embrace
of the hadow, came that light which alone might have had power to
startle--the light of enduring ove en toiled at the grave in

nd that last hour--speak of it emember that, beyond the naked fact
of the catastrophe itself,  know nothing hen, coming out from among
mankind,  passed into ight through the rave--at that period, if 
remember aright, the calamity which overwhelmed you was utterly
unanticipated ut, indeed,  knew little of the speculative
philosophy of the day
iros
he individual calamity was, as you say, entirely unanticipated but
analogous misfortunes had been long a subject of discussion with
astronomers  need scarce tell you, my friend, that, even when you
left us, men had agreed to understand those passages in the most holy
writings which speak of the final destruction of all things by fire as
having reference to the orb of the earth alone, ut in regard to the
immediate agency of the ruin, speculation had been at fault from that
epoch in astronomical knowledge in which the comets were divested of
the terrors of flame he very moderate density of these bodies had
been well established hey had been observed to pass among the
satellites of upiter without bringing about any sensible alteration
either in the masses or in the orbits of these secondary planets e
had long regarded the wanderers as vapory creations of inconceivable
tenuity, and as altogether incapable of doing injury to our
substantial globe, even in the event of contact ut contact was not
in any degree dreaded for the elements of all the comets were
accurately known hat among them we should look for the agency of
the threatened fiery destruction had been for many years considered an
inadmissible idea ut wonders and wild fancies had been of late days
strangely rife among mankind and, although it was only with a few of
the ignorant that actual apprehension prevailed, upon the announcement
by astronomers of a new comet, yet this announcement was generally
received with  know not what of agitation and mistrust
he elements of the strange orb were immediately calculated, and it
was at once conceded by all observers that its path, at perihelion
would bring it into very close proximity with the earth here were
two or three astronomers of secondary note who resolutely maintained
that a contact was inevitable  cannot very well express to you the
effect of this intelligence upon the people or a few short days they
would not believe an assertion which their intellect, so long employed
among worldly considerations, could not in any manner grasp ut the
truth of a vitally important fact soon makes its way into the
understanding of even the most stolid inally, all men saw that
astronomical knowledge lies not, and they awaited the comet ts
approach was not at first seemingly rapid, nor was its appearance of
very unusual character t was of a dull red, and had little
perceptible train or seven or eight days we saw no material increase
in its apparent diameter, and but a partial alteration in its color
eantime, the ordinary affairs of men were discarded, and all interest
absorbed in a growing discussion instituted by the philosophic in
respect to the cometary nature ven the grossly ignorant aroused
their sluggish capacities to such considerations he learned now
gave their intellect--their soul--to no such points as the allaying of
fear, or to the sustenance of loved theory hey sought--they panted
for right views hey groaned for perfected knowledge ruth arose
in the purity of her strength and exceeding majesty, and the wise
bowed down and adored
hat material injury to our globe or to its inhabitants would result
from the apprehended contact was an opinion which hourly lost ground
among the wise and the wise were now freely permitted to rule the
reason and the fancy of the crowd t was demonstrated that the
density of the comets nucleus was far less than that of our rarest
gas and the harmless passage of a similar visitor among the
satellites of upiter was a point strongly insisted upon, and which
served greatly to allay terror heologists, with an earnestness
fear-enkindled, dwelt upon the biblical prophecies, and expounded them
to the people with a directness and simplicity of which no previous
instance had been known hat the final destruction of the earth must
be brought about by the agency of fire, was urged with a spirit that
enforced everywhere conviction and that the comets were of no fiery
nature as all men now knew was a truth which relieved all, in a
great measure, from the apprehension of the great calamity foretold
t is noticeable that the popular prejudices and vulgar errors in
regard to pestilences and wars--errors which were wont to prevail upon
every appearance of a comet--were now altogether unknown, as if by
some sudden convulsive exertion reason had at once hurled superstition
from her throne he feeblest intellect had derived vigor from
excessive interest
hat minor evils might arise from the contact were points of elaborate
question he learned spoke of slight geological disturbances, of
probable alterations in climate, and consequently in vegetation of
possible magnetic and electric influences any held that no visible
or perceptible effect would in any manner be produced hile such
discussions were going on, their subject gradually approached, growing
larger in apparent diameter, and of a more brilliant lustre ankind
grew paler as it came ll human operations were suspended
here was an epoch in the course of the general sentiment when the
comet had attained, at length, a size surpassing that of any
previously recorded visitation he people now, dismissing any
lingering hope that the astronomers were wrong, experienced all the
certainty of evil he chimerical aspect of their terror was gone he
hearts of the stoutest of our race beat violently within their bosoms
 very few days suffered, however, to merge even such feelings in
sentiments more unendurable e could no longer apply to the strange
orb any accustomed thoughts ts historical attributes had
disappeared t oppressed us with a hideous novelty of emotion e
saw it not as an astronomical phenomenon in the heavens, but as an
incubus upon our hearts and a shadow upon our brains t had taken,
with unconceivable rapidity, the character of a gigantic mantle of
rare flame, extending from horizon to horizon
et a day, and men breathed with greater freedom t was clear that we
were already within the influence of the comet yet we lived e even
felt an unusual elasticity of frame and vivacity of mind he
exceeding tenuity of the object of our dread was apparent for all
heavenly objects were plainly visible through it eantime, our
vegetation had perceptibly altered and we gained faith, from this
predicted circumstance, in the foresight of the wise  wild
luxuriance of foliage, utterly unknown before, burst out upon every
vegetable thing
et another day--and the evil was not altogether upon us t was now
evident that its nucleus would first reach us  wild change had come
over all men and the first sense of pain was the wild signal for
general lamentation and horror he first sense of pain lay in a
rigorous construction of the breast and lungs, and an insufferable
dryness of the skin t could not be denied that our atmosphere was
radically affected the conformation of this atmosphere and the
possible modifications to which it might be subjected, were now the
topics of discussion he result of investigation sent an electric
thrill of the intensest terror through the universal heart of man
t had been long known that the air which encircled us was a compound
of oxygen and nitrogen gases, in the proportion of twenty-one measures
of oxygen and seventy-nine of nitrogen in every one hundred of the
atmosphere xygen, which was the principle of combustion, and the
vehicle of heat, was absolutely necessary to the support of animal
life, and was the most powerful and energetic agent in nature
itrogen, on the contrary, was incapable of supporting either animal
life or flame n unnatural excess of oxygen would result, it had been
ascertained, in just such an elevation of the animal spirits as we had
latterly experienced t was the pursuit, the extension of the idea,
which had engendered awe hat would be the result of a total
extraction of the nitrogen?  combustion irresistible, all-devouring,
omni-prevalent, immediate--the entire fulfilment, in all their
minute and terrible details, of the fiery and horror-inspiring
denunciations of the prophecies of the oly ook
hy need  paint, harmion, the now disenchained frenzy of mankind?
hat tenuity in the comet which had previously inspired us with hope,
was now the source of the bitterness of despair n its impalpable
gaseous character we clearly perceived the consummation of ate

ope e gasped in the rapid modification of the air he red blood
bounded tumultuously through its strict channels  furious delirium
possessed all men and with arms rigidly outstretched towards the

of the destroyer was now upon us--even here in idenn  shudder while

all things hen--let us bow down, harmion, before the excessive
majesty of the great od--then, there came a shouting and pervading
sound, as if from the mouth itself of  while the whole incumbent

some to disbelieve and some to doubt, and yet a few who will find much
to ponder upon in the characters here graven with a stylus of iron
he year had been a year of terror, and of feeling more intense than
terror for which there is no name upon the earth or many prodigies and
signs had taken place, and far and wide, over sea and land, the black
wings of the estilence were spread abroad o those, nevertheless,
cunning in the stars, it was not unknown that the heavens wore an aspect
of ill and to me, the reek inos, among others, it was evident that
now had arrived the alternation of that seven hundred and ninety-fourth
year when, at the entrance of ries, the planet upiter is enjoined with
the red ring of the terrible aturnus he peculiar spirit of the skies,
if  mistake not greatly, made itself manifest, not only in the physical
orb of the earth, but in the souls, imaginations, and meditations of
mankind
ver some flasks of the red hian wine, within the walls of a noble
hall, in a dim city called tolemais, we sat, at night, a company of
seven nd to our chamber there was no entrance save by a lofty door of
brass and the door was fashioned by the artisan orinnos, and, being of
rare workmanship, was fastened from within lack draperies, likewise in
the gloomy room, shut out from our view the moon, the lurid stars, and
the peopleless streets--but the boding and the memory of vil, they
would not be so excluded here were things around us and about of which
 can render no distinct account--things material and spiritual--
heaviness in the atmosphere--a sense of suffocation--anxiety--and, above
all, that terrible state of existence which the nervous experience when
the senses are keenly living and awake, and meanwhile the powers of
thought lie dormant  dead weight hung upon us t hung upon our
limbs--upon the household furniture--upon the goblets from which we
drank and all things were depressed, and borne down thereby--all things
save only the flames of the seven iron lamps which illumined our revel
prearing themselves in tall slender lines of light, they thus remained
burning all pallid and motionless and in the mirror which their lustre
formed upon the round table of ebony at which we sat each of us there
assembled beheld the pallor of his own countenance, and the unquiet
glare in the downcast eyes of his companions et we laughed and were
merry in our proper way--which was hysterical and sang the songs of
nacreon--which are madness and drank deeply--although the purple wine
reminded us of blood or there was yet another tenant of our chamber in
the person of young oilus ead and at full length he lay,
enshrouded--the genius and the demon of the scene las he bore no
portion in our mirth, save that his countenance, distorted with the
plague, and his eyes in which eath had but half extinguished the fire
of the pestilence, seemed to take such an interest in our merriment as
the dead may haply take in the merriment of those who are to die ut
although , inos, felt that the eyes of the departed were upon me,
still  forced myself not to perceive the bitterness of their
expression, and gazing down steadily into the depths of the ebony
mirror, sang with a loud and sonorous voice the songs of the son of
eos ut gradually my songs they ceased, and their echoes, rolling afar
off among the sable draperies of the chamber, became weak, and
undistinguishable, and so faded away nd lo from among those sable
draperies, where the sounds of the song departed, there came forth a
dark and undefiled shadow--a shadow such as the moon, when low in
heaven, might fashion from the figure of a man but it was the shadow
neither of man nor of od, nor of any familiar thing nd quivering
awhile among the draperies of the room it at length rested in full view
upon the surface of the door of brass ut the shadow was vague, and
formless, and indefinite, and was the shadow neither of man nor
od--neither od of reece, nor od of halda, nor any gyptian od
nd the shadow rested upon the brazen doorway, and under the arch of the
entablature of the door and moved not, nor spoke any word, but there
became stationary and remained nd the door whereupon the shadow rested
was, if  remember aright, over against the feet of the young oilus
enshrouded ut we, the seven there assembled, having seen the shadow as
it came out from among the draperies, dared not steadily behold it, but
cast down our eyes, and gazed continually into the depths of the mirror
of ebony nd at length , inos, speaking some low words, demanded of
the shadow its dwelling and its appellation nd the shadow answered, 
am , and my dwelling is near to the atacombs of tolemais, and
hard by those dim plains of elusion which border upon the foul
haronian canal nd then did we, the seven, start from our seats in
horror, and stand trembling, and shuddering, and aghast for the tones
in the voice of the shadow were not the tones of any one being, but of a
multitude of beings, and varying in their cadences from syllable to
syllable, fell duskily upon our ears in the well remembered and familiar
accents of many thousand departed friends

of the river ire nd there is no quiet there, nor silence
he waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue and they flow
not onward to the sea, but palpitate forever and forever beneath the red
eye of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive motion or many miles
on either side of the rivers oozy bed is a pale desert of gigantic
water-lilies hey sigh one unto the other in that solitude, and stretch
towards the heaven their long and ghastly necks, and nod to and fro
their everlasting heads nd there is an indistinct murmur which cometh
out from among them like the rushing of subterrene water nd they sigh
one unto the other
ut there is a boundary to their realm--the boundary of the dark,
horrible, lofty forest here, like the waves about the ebrides, the
low underwood is agitated continually ut there is no wind throughout
the heaven nd the tall primeval trees rock eternally hither and
thither with a crashing and mighty sound nd from their high summits,
one by one, drop everlasting dews nd at the roots, strange poisonous
flowers lie writhing in perturbed slumber nd overhead, with a rustling
and loud noise, the gray clouds rush westwardly forever until they roll,
a cataract, over the fiery wall of the horizon ut there is no wind
throughout the heaven nd by the shores of the river ire there is
neither quiet nor silence
t was night, and the rain fell and, falling, it was rain, but, having
fallen, it was blood nd  stood in the morass among the tall lilies,
and the rain fell upon my head--and the lilies sighed one unto the other
in the solemnity of their desolation
nd, all at once, the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist, and was
crimson in color nd mine eyes fell upon a huge gray rock which stood
by the shore of the river and was lighted by the light of the moon nd
the rock was gray and ghastly, and tall,--and the rock was gray pon
its front were characters engraven in the stones and  walked through
the morass of water-lilies, until  came close unto the shore, that 
might read the characters upon the stone ut  could not decipher them
nd  was going back into the morass when the moon shone with a fuller
red, and  turned and looked again upon the rock and upon the
characters--and the characters were 
nd  looked upwards, and there stood a man upon the summit of the
rock and  hid myself among the water-lilies that  might discover the
action of the man nd the man was tall and stately in form, and wrapped
up from his shoulders to his feet in the toga of old ome nd the
outlines of his figure were indistinct--but his features were the
features of a deity for the mantle of the night, and of the mist, and
of the moon, and of the dew, had left uncovered the features of his
face nd his brow was lofty with thought, and his eye wild with care
and in the few furrows upon his cheek,  read the fables of sorrow, and
weariness, and disgust with mankind, and a longing after solitude
nd the man sat upon the rock, and leaned his head upon his hand, and
looked out upon the desolation e looked down into the low unquiet
shrubbery, and up into the tall primeval trees, and up higher at the
rustling heaven, and into the crimson moon nd  lay close within
shelter of the lilies, and observed the actions of the man nd the man
trembled in the solitude--but the night waned, and he sat upon the
rock
nd the man turned his attention from the heaven, and looked out upon
the dreary river ire, and upon the yellow ghastly waters, and upon the
pale legions of the water-lilies nd the man listened to the sighs of
the water-lilies, and to the murmur that came up from among them nd 
lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man nd the
man trembled in the solitude--but the night waned, and he sat upon the
rock
hen  went down into the recesses of the morass, and waded afar in
among the wilderness of the lilies, and called unto the hippopotami
which dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the morass nd the
hippopotami heard my call, and came, with the behemoth, unto the foot of
the rock, and roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon nd  lay
close within my covert and observed the actions of the man nd the man
trembled in the solitude--but the night waned, and he sat upon the
rock
hen  cursed the elements with the curse of tumult and a frightful
tempest gathered in the heaven, where before there had been no wind nd
the heaven became livid with the violence of the tempest--and the rain
beat upon the head of the man--and the floods of the river came
down--and the river was tormented into foam--and the water-lilies
shrieked within their beds--and the forest crumbled before the wind--and
the thunder rolled--and the lightning fell--and the rock rocked to its
foundation nd  lay close within my covert and observed the actions of
the man nd the man trembled in the solitude--but the night waned, and
he sat upon the rock
hen  grew angry and cursed, with the curse of silence, the river, and
the lilies, and the wind, and the forest, and the heaven, and the
thunder, and the sighs of the water-lilies nd they became accursed,
and were still nd the moon ceased to totter up its pathway to
heaven--and the thunder died away--and the lightning did not flash--and
the clouds hung motionless--and the waters sunk to their level and
remained--and the trees ceased to rock--and the water-lilies sighed no
more--and the murmur was heard no longer from among them, nor any shadow
of sound throughout the vast illimitable desert nd  looked upon the
characters of the rock, and they were changed--and the characters were
nd mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man, and his countenance
was wan with terror nd, hurriedly, he raised his head from his hand,
and stood forth upon the rock and listened ut there was no voice
throughout the vast illimitable desert, and the characters upon the rock
were  nd the man shuddered, and turned his face away, and fled
afar off, in haste, so that  beheld him no more

n speaking of the oetic rinciple,  have no design to be either
thorough or profound hile discussing very much at random the
essentiality of what we call oetry, my principal purpose will be to
cite for consideration some few of those minor nglish or merican poems
which best suit my own taste, or which, upon my own fancy, have left the
most definite impression y minor poems  mean, of course, poems of
little length nd here, in the beginning, permit me to say a few words
in regard to a somewhat peculiar principle, which, whether rightfully or
wrongfully, has always had its influence in my own critical estimate of
the poem  hold that a long poem does not exist  maintain that the
phrase, a long poem, is simply a flat contradiction in terms
 need scarcely observe that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as
it excites, by elevating the soul he value of the poem is in the ratio
of this elevating excitement ut all excitements are, through a psychal
necessity, transient hat degree of excitement which would entitle a
poem to be so called at all, cannot be sustained throughout a
composition of any great length fter the lapse of half an hour, at the
very utmost, it flags--fails--a revulsion ensues--and then the poem is,
in effect, and in fact, no longer such
here are, no doubt, many who have found difficulty in reconciling the
critical dictum that the aradise ost is to be devoutly admired
throughout, with the absolute impossibility of maintaining for it,
during perusal, the amount of enthusiasm which that critical dictum
would demand his great work, in fact, is to be regarded as poetical
only when, losing sight of that vital requisite in all works of rt,
nity, we view it merely as a series of minor poems f, to preserve its
nity--its totality of effect or impression--we read it as would be
necessary at a single sitting, the result is but a constant alternation
of excitement and depression fter a passage of what we feel to be true
poetry, there follows, inevitably, a passage of platitude which no
critical prejudgment can force us to admire but if, upon completing the
work, we read it again omitting the first book--that is to say,
commencing with the second--we shall be surprised at now finding that
admirable which we before condemned--that damnable which we had
previously so much admired t follows from all this that the ultimate,
aggregate, or absolute effect of even the best epic under the sun, is a
nullity--and this is precisely the fact
n regard to the liad, we have, if not positive proof, at least very
good reason, for believing it intended as a series of lyrics but,
granting the epic intention,  can say only that the work is based in an
imperfect sense of rt he modern epic is, of the supposititious
ancient model, but an inconsiderate and blindfold imitation ut the day
of these artistic anomalies is over f, at any time, any very long poem
were popular in reality--which  doubt--it is at least clear that no
very long poem will ever be popular again
hat the extent of a poetical work is ceteris paribus, the measure of
its merit, seems undoubtedly, when we thus state it, a proposition
sufficiently absurd--yet we are indebted for it to the uarterly
eviews urely there can be nothing in mere size, abstractly
considered--there can be nothing in mere bulk, so far as a volume is
concerned, which has so continuously elicited admiration from these
saturnine pamphlets  mountain, to be sure, by the mere sentiment of
physical magnitude which it conveys, does impress us with a sense of
the sublime--but no man is impressed after this fashion by the
material grandeur of even he olumbiad ven the uarterlies have not
instructed us to be so impressed by it s yet, they have not
insisted on our estimating amartine by the cubic foot, or ollock by
the pound--but what else are we to infer from their continual prating
about sustained effort? f, by sustained effort, any little
gentleman has accomplished an epic, let us frankly commend him for the
effort--if this indeed be a thing commendable--but let us forbear
praising the epic on the efforts account t is to be hoped thai common
sense, in the time to come, will prefer deciding upon a work of rt
rather by the impression it makes--by the effect it produces--than by
the time it took to impress the effect, or by the amount of sustained
effort which had been found necessary in effecting the impression he
fact is, that perseverance is one thing and genius quite another--nor
can all the uarterlies in hristendom confound them y and by, this
proposition, with many which  have been just urging, will be received
as self-evident n the meantime, by being generally condemned as
falsities, they will not be essentially damaged as truths
n the other hand, it is clear that a poem may be improperly brief
ndue brevity degenerates into mere epigrammatism  very short poem,
while now and then producing a brilliant or vivid, never produces a
profound or enduring effect here must be the steady pressing down of
the stamp upon the wax e ranger has wrought innumerable things,
pungent and spirit-stirring, but in general they have been too
imponderous to stamp themselves deeply into the public attention, and
thus, as so many feathers of fancy, have been blown aloft only to be
whistled down the wind
 remarkable instance of the effect of undue brevity in depressing a
poem, in keeping it out of the popular view, is afforded by the
following exquisite little erenade
 arise from dreams of thee
n the first sweet sleep of night
hen the winds are breathing low,
nd the stars are shining bright
 arise from dreams of thee,
nd a spirit in my feet
as led me--who knows how?--
o thy chamber-window, sweet
he wandering airs they faint
n the dark the silent stream--
he champak odors fail

he nightingales complaint,
t dies upon her heart,

, lift me from the grass
 die,  faint,  fail
et thy love in kisses rain
n my lips and eyelids pale
y cheek is cold and white, alas
y heart beats loud and fast
, press it close to thine again,
here it will break at last
ery few perhaps are familiar with these lines, yet no less a poet than
helley is their author heir warm, yet delicate and ethereal
imagination will be appreciated by all, but by none so thoroughly as by
him who has himself arisen from sweet dreams of one beloved to bathe in
the aromatic air of a southern midsummer night
ne of the finest poems by illis, the very best in my opinion which he
has ever written, has no doubt, through this same defect of undue
brevity, been kept back from its proper position, not less in the
critical than in the popular view
he shadows lay along roadway,
was near the twilight-tide--
nd slowly there a lady fair
as walking in her pride
lone walkd she but, viewlessly

n this composition we find it difficult to recognise the illis who has
written so many mere verses of society he lines are not only richly
ideal but full of energy, while they breathe an earnestness, an evident
sincerity of sentiment, for which we look in vain throughout all the
other works of this author
hile the epic mania, while the idea that to merit in poetry prolixity
is indispensable, has for some years past been gradually dying out of
the public mind, by mere dint of its own absurdity, we find it succeeded
by a heresy too palpably false to be long tolerated, but one which, in
the brief period it has already endured, may be said to have
accomplished more in the corruption of our oetical iterature than all
its other enemies combined  allude to the heresy of he idactic t
has been assumed, tacitly and avowedly, directly and indirectly, that
the ultimate object of all oetry is truth very poem, it is said,
should inculcate a moral, and by this moral is the poetical merit of the
work to be adjudged e mericans especially have patronized this happy
idea, and we ostonians very especially have developed it in full e
have taken it into our heads that to write a poem simply for the poems
sake, and to acknowledge such to have been our design, would be to
confess ourselves radically wanting in the true poetic dignity and
force--but the simple fact is that would we but permit ourselves to
look into our own souls we should immediately there discover that under
the sun there neither exists nor can exist any work more thoroughly
dignified, more supremely noble, than this very poem, this poem per
se, this poem which is a poem and nothing more, this poem written
solely for the poems sake
ith as deep a reverence for the rue as ever inspired the bosom of man,
 would nevertheless limit, in some measure, its modes of inculcation 
would limit to enforce them  would not enfeeble them by dissipation
he demands of ruth are severe he has no sympathy with the myrtles
ll that which is so indispensable in ong is precisely all that
with which she has nothing whatever to do t is but making her a
flaunting paradox to wreathe her in gems and flowers n enforcing a
truth we need severity rather than efflorescence of language e must be
simple, precise, terse e must be cool, calm, unimpassioned n a word,
we must be in that mood which, as nearly as possible, is the exact
converse of the poetical e must be blind indeed who does not
perceive the radical and chasmal difference between the truthful and the
poetical modes of inculcation e must be theory-mad beyond redemption
who, in spite of these differences, shall still persist in attempting to
reconcile the obstinate oils and waters of oetry and ruth
ividing the world of mind into its three most immediately obvious
distinctions, we have the ure ntellect, aste, and the oral ense 
place aste in the middle because it is just this position which in the
mind it occupies t holds intimate relations with either extreme but
from the oral ense is separated by so faint a difference that
ristotle has not hesitated to place some of its operations among the
virtues themselves evertheless we find the offices of the trio
marked with a sufficient distinction ust as the ntellect concerns
itself with ruth, so aste informs us of the eautiful, while the oral
ense is regardful of uty f this latter, while onscience teaches the
obligation, and eason the expediency, aste contents herself with
displaying the charms, waging war upon ice solely on the ground of her
deformity, her disproportion, her animosity to the fitting, to the
appropriate, to the harmonious, in a word, to eauty
n immortal instinct deep within the spirit of man is thus plainly a
sense of the eautiful his it is which administers to his delight in
the manifold forms, and sounds, and odors, and sentiments amid which he
exists nd just as the lily is repeated in the lake, or the eyes of
maryllis in the mirror, so is the mere oral or written repetition of
these forms, and sounds, and colors, and odors, and sentiments a
duplicate source of delight ut this mere repetition is not poetry e
who shall simply sing, with however glowing enthusiasm, or with however
vivid a truth of description, of the sights, and sounds, and odors, and
colors, and sentiments which greet him in common with all mankind--he, 
say, has yet failed to prove his divine title here is still a
something in the distance which he has been unable to attain e have
still a thirst unquenchable, to allay which he has not shown us the
crystal springs his thirst belongs to the immortality of man t is at
once a consequence and an indication of his perennial existence t is
the desire of the moth for the star t is no mere appreciation of the
eauty before us, but a wild effort to reach the eauty above nspired
by an ecstatic prescience of the glories beyond the grave, we struggle
by multiform combinations among the things and thoughts of ime to
attain a portion of that oveliness whose very elements perhaps
appertain to eternity alone nd thus when by oetry, or when by usic,
the most entrancing of the poetic moods, we find ourselves melted into
tears, we weep then, not as the bbate ravina supposes, through excess
of pleasure, but through a certain petulant, impatient sorrow at our
inability to grasp now, wholly, here on earth, at once and forever,
those divine and rapturous joys of which through the poem, or
through the music, we attain to but brief and indeterminate glimpses
he struggle to apprehend the supernal oveliness--this struggle, on the
part of souls fittingly constituted--has given to the world all that
which it the world has ever been enabled at once to understand and to
feel as poetic
he oetic entiment, of course, may develop itself in various modes--in
ainting, in culpture, in rchitecture, in the ance--very especially
in usic--and very peculiarly, and with a wide field, in the composition
of the andscape arden ur present theme, however, has regard only to
its manifestation in words nd here let me speak briefly on the topic
of rhythm ontenting myself with the certainty that usic, in its
various modes of metre, rhythm, and rhyme, is of so vast a moment in
oetry as never to be wisely rejected--is so vitally important an
adjunct, that he is simply silly who declines its assistance,  will not
now pause to maintain its absolute essentiality t is in usic perhaps
that the soul most nearly attains the great end for which, when inspired
by the poetic entiment, it struggles--the creation of supernal eauty
t may be, indeed, that here this sublime end is, now and, then,
attained in fact e are often made to feel, with a shivering delight,
that from an earthly harp are stricken notes which cannot have been
unfamiliar to the angels nd thus there can be little doubt that in the
union of oetry with usic in its popular sense, we shall find the
widest field for the oetic development he old ards and innesingers
had advantages which we do not possess--and homas oore, singing his
own songs, was, in the most legitimate manner, perfecting them as poems
o recapitulate then-- would define, in brief, the oetry of words as
he hythmical reation of eauty ts sole arbiter is aste ith the
ntellect or with the onscience it has only collateral relations
nless incidentally, it has no concern whatever either with uty or with
ruth
 few words, however, in explanation hat pleasure which is at once
the most pure, the most elevating, and the most intense, is derived, 
maintain, from the contemplation of the eautiful n the contemplation
of eauty we alone find it possible to attain that pleasurable
elevation, or excitement of the soul, which we recognize as the oetic
entiment, and which is so easily distinguished from ruth, which is the
satisfaction of the eason, or from assion, which is the excitement of
the heart  make eauty, therefore--using the word as inclusive of the
sublime-- make eauty the province of the poem, simply because it is an
obvious rule of rt that effects should be made to spring as directly as
possible from their causes--no one as yet having been weak enough to
deny that the peculiar elevation in question is at least most readily
attainable in the poem t by no means follows, however, that the
incitements of assion, or the precepts of uty, or even the lessons of
ruth, may not be introduced into a poem, and with advantage for they
may subserve incidentally, in various ways, the general purposes of the
work but the true artist will always contrive to tone them down in
proper subjection to that eauty which is the atmosphere and the real
essence of the poem
 cannot better introduce the few poems which  shall present for your
consideration, than by the citation of the rem to ongfellows aif
he day is done, and the darkness

hat my soul cannot resist
 feeling of sadness and longing,
hat is not akin to pain,
nd resembles sorrow only
s the mist resembles the rain
ome, read to me some poem,
ome simple and heartfelt lay,
hat shall soothe this restless feeling,
nd banish the thoughts of day

ot from the bards sublime,
hose distant footsteps echo

or, like strains of martial music,
heir mighty thoughts suggest

nd to-night  long for rest

s showers from the clouds of summer,

nd nights devoid of ease,

ith no great range of imagination, these lines have been justly admired
for their delicacy of expression ome of the images are very effective
othing can be better than
--the bards sublime,
hose distant footsteps echo
own the corridors of ime
he idea of the last quatrain is also very effective he poem on the
whole, however, is chiefly to be admired for the graceful insouciance
of its metre, so well in accordance with the character of the
sentiments, and especially for the ease of the general manner his
ease or naturalness, in a literary style, it has long been the fashion
to regard as ease in appearance alone--as a point of really difficult
attainment ut not so--a natural manner is difficult only to him who
should never meddle with it--to the unnatural t is but the result of
writing with the understanding, or with the instinct, that the tone,
in composition, should always be that which the mass of mankind would
adopt--and must perpetually vary, of course, with the occasion he
author who, after the fashion of he orth merican eview, should be
upon all occasions merely quiet, must necessarily upon many
occasions be simply silly, or stupid and has no more right to be
considered easy or natural than a ockney exquisite, or than the
sleeping eauty in the waxworks

nd what, if cheerful shouts at noon,
ome, from the village sent,
r songs of maids, beneath the moon,
ith fairy laughter blent?
nd what if, in the evening light,
etrothed lovers walk in sight
f my low monument?
 would the lovely scene around
ight know no sadder sight nor sound

he seasons glorious show,
or would its brightness shine for me
or its wild music flow

hose part in all the pomp that fills
he circuit of the summer hills,
s--that his grave is green
nd deeply would their hearts rejoice
o hear again his living voice
he rhythmical flow here is even voluptuous--nothing could be more
melodious he poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner he
intense melancholy which seems to well up, perforce, to the surface of
all the poets cheerful sayings about his grave, we find thrilling us to
the soul--while there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill he
impression left is one of a pleasurable sadness nd if, in the
remaining compositions which  shall introduce to you, there be more or
less of a similar tone always apparent, let me remind you that how or
why we know not this certain taint of sadness is inseparably connected
with all the higher manifestations of true eauty t is, nevertheless,
 feeling of sadness and longing
hat is not akin to pain,
nd resembles sorrow only
s the mist resembles the rain

of brilliancy and spirit as he ealth of dward oote inkney

ad he been a ew nglander, it is probable that he would have been
ranked as the first of merican lyrists by that magnanimous cabal which
has so long controlled the destinies of merican etters, in conducting
the thing called he orth merican eview he poem just cited is
especially beautiful but the poetic elevation which it induces we must
refer chiefly to our sympathy in the poets enthusiasm e pardon his
hyperboles for the evident earnestness with which they are uttered
t was by no means my design, however, to expatiate upon the merits
of what  should read you hese will necessarily speak for themselves
occalina, in his dvertisements from arnassus, tells us that oilus
once presented pollo a very caustic criticism upon a very admirable
book--whereupon the god asked him for the beauties of the work e
replied that he only busied himself about the errors n hearing this,
pollo, handing him a sack of unwinnowed wheat, bade him pick out all
the chaff for his reward
ow this fable answers very well as a hit at the critics--but  am by no
means sure that the god was in the right  am by no means certain that
the true limits of the critical duty are not grossly misunderstood
xcellence, in a poem especially, may be considered in the light of an
axiom, which need only be properly put, to become self-evident t is
not excellence if it require to be demonstrated its such--and thus to
point out too particularly the merits of a work of rt, is to admit that
they are not merits altogether
mong the elodies of homas oore is one whose distinguished
character as a poem proper seems to have been singularly left out of
view  allude to his lines beginning--ome, rest in this bosom he
intense energy of their expression is not surpassed by anything in
yron here are two of the lines in which a sentiment is conveyed that
embodies the all in all of the divine passion of ove--a sentiment
which, perhaps, has found its echo in more, and in more passionate,
human hearts that any other single sentiment ever embodied in words
ome, rest in this bosom, my own stricken deer,
hough the herd have fled from thee, thy home is still here
ere still is the smile, that no cloud can oercast,
nd a heart and a hand all thy own to the last

t has been the fashion of late days to deny oore magination, while
granting him ancy--a distinction originating with oleridge--than whom
no man more fully comprehended the great powers of oore he fact is,
that the fancy of this poet so far predominates over all his other
faculties, and over the fancy of all other men, as to have induced, very
naturally, the idea that he is fanciful only ut never was there a
greater mistake ever was a grosser wrong done the fame of a true poet

he aunted ouse, by the same author, is one of the truest poems ever

fantastic, is nevertheless admirably adapted to the wild insanity which
is the thesis of the poem

very brief specimen  call him, and think him the noblest of poets,

hus, although in a very cursory and imperfect manner,  have endeavored
to convey to you my conception of the oetic rinciple t has been my
purpose to suggest that, while this rinciple itself is strictly and
simply the uman spiration for upernal eauty, the manifestation of
the rinciple is always found in an elevating excitement of the soul,
quite independent of that passion which is the intoxication of the
eart, or of that truth which is the satisfaction of the eason or in
regard to passion, alas its tendency is to degrade rather than to
elevate the oul ove, on the contrary--ove--the true, the divine
ros--the ranian as distinguished from the ionasan enus--is
unquestionably the purest and truest of all poetical themes nd in
regard to ruth, if, to be sure, through the attainment of a truth we
are led to perceive a harmony where none was apparent before, we
experience at once the true poetical effect but this effect is
referable to the harmony alone, and not in the least degree to the truth
which merely served to render the harmony manifest
e shall reach, however, more immediately a distinct conception of what
true oetry is, by mere reference to a few of the simple elements which
induce in the oet himself the true poetical effect e recognizes the
ambrosia which nourishes his soul in the bright orbs that shine in
eaven, in the volutes of the flower, in the clustering of low
shrubberies, in the waving of the grain-fields, in the slanting of tall
eastern trees, in the blue distance of mountains, in the grouping of
clouds, in the twinkling of half-hidden brooks, in the gleaming of
silver rivers, in the repose of sequestered lakes, in the star-mirroring
depths of lonely wells e perceives it in the songs of birds, in the
harp of olus, in the sighing of the night-wind, in the repining voice
of the forest, in the surf that complains to the shore, in the fresh
breath of the woods, in the scent of the violet, in the voluptuous
perfume of the hyacinth, in the suggestive odor that comes to him at
eventide from far-distant undiscovered islands, over dim oceans,
illimitable and unexplored e owns it in all noble thoughts, in all
unworldly motives, in all holy impulses, in all chivalrous, generous,
and self-sacrificing deeds e feels it in the beauty of woman, in the
grace of her step, in the lustre of her eye, in the melody of her voice,
in her soft laughter, in her sigh, in the harmony of the rustling of her
robes e deeply feels it in her winning endearments, in her burning
enthusiasms, in her gentle charities, in her meek and devotional
endurance, but above all, ah, far above all, he kneels to it, he
worships it in the faith, in the purity, in the strength, in the
altogether divine majesty of her love
et me conclude by the recitation of yet another brief poem, one very
different in character from any that  have before quoted t is by
otherwell, and is called he ong of the avalier ith our modern
and altogether rational ideas of the absurdity and impiety of warfare,
we are not precisely in that frame of mind best adapted to sympathize
with the sentiments, and thus to appreciate the real excellence of the
poem o do this fully we must identify ourselves in fancy with the soul
of the old cavalier

or beauty,  replied

he intellectual activity of mily ickinson was so great that
a large and characteristic choice is still possible among her
literary material, and this third volume of her verses is put
forth in response to the repeated wish of the admirers of her
peculiar genius uch of mily ickinsons prose was rhythmic,
--even rhymed, though frequently not set apart in lines
lso many verses, written as such, were sent to friends in
letters these were published in , in the volumes of her
etters t has not been necessary, however, to include them in
this eries, and all have been omitted, except three or four
exceptionally strong ones, as  ook, and ith lowers
here is internal evidence that many of the poems were simply
spontaneous flashes of insight, apparently unrelated to outward
circumstance thers, however, had an obvious personal origin
for example, the verses  had a uinea golden, which seem to
have been sent to some friend travelling in urope, as a dainty
reminder of letter-writing delinquencies he surroundings in
which any of mily ickinsons verses are known to have been
written usually serve to explain them clearly but in general the
present volume is full of thoughts needing no interpretation to
those who apprehend this scintillating spirit

shore at last
 do not love you as if you were salt-rose, or topaz,
or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off
 love you as certain dark things are to be loved,
in secret, between the shadow and the soul
 love you as the plant that never blooms
but carries in itself the light of hidden flowers
thanks to your love a certain solid fragrance,
risen from the earth, lives darkly in my body
 love you without knowing how, or when, or from where
 love you straightforwardly, without complexities or pride
so  love you because  know no other way
than this where  does not exist, nor you,
so close that your hand on my chest is my hand,
so close that your eyes close as  fall asleep
 want you to know
one thing
ou know how this is
if  look
at the crystal moon, at the red branch
of the slow autumn at my window,
if  touch
near the fire
the impalpable ash
or the wrinkled body of the log,
everything carries me to you,
as if everything that exists,
aromas, light, metals,
were little boats
that sail
toward those isles of yours that wait for me
ell, now,
if little by little you stop loving me
 shall stop loving you little by little
f suddenly
you forget me
do not look for me,
for  shall already have forgotten you
f you think it long and mad,
the wind of banners
that passes through my life,
and you decide
to leave me at the shore
of the heart where  have roots,
remember
that on that day,
at that hour,
 shall lift my arms
and my roots will set off
to seek another land
ut
if each day,
each hour,
you feel that you are destined for me
with implacable sweetness,
if each day a flower
climbs up to your lips to seek me,
ah my love, ah my own,
in me all that fire is repeated,
in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten,
my love feeds on your love, beloved,
and as long as you live it will be in your arms
without leaving mine
 crave your mouth, your voice, your hair
ilent and starving,  prowl through the streets
read does not nourish me, dawn disrupts me, all day
 hunt for the liquid measure of your steps
 hunger for your sleek laugh,
your hands the color of a savage harvest,
hunger for the pale stones of your fingernails,
 want to eat your skin like a whole almond
 want to eat the sunbeam flaring in your lovely body,
the sovereign nose of your arrogant face,
 want to eat the fleeting shade of your lashes,
and  pace around hungry, sniffing the twilight,
hunting for you, for your hot heart,
like a puma in the barrens of uitratue
very day you play with the light of the universe
ubtle visitor, you arrive in the flower and the water,
ou are more than this white head that  hold tightly
as a bunch of flowers, every day, between my hands
ou are like nobody since  love you
et me spread you out among yellow garlands
ho writes your name in letters of smoke among the stars of the south?
h let me remember you as you were before you existed
uddenly the wind howls and bangs at my shut window
he sky is a net crammed with shadowy fish
ere all the winds let go sooner or later, all of them
he rain takes off her clothes
he birds go by, fleeing
he wind  he wind
 alone can contend against the power of men
he storm whirls dark leaves
and turns loose all the boats that were moored last night to the sky
ou are here  h, you do not run away
ou will answer me to the last cry
url round me as though you were frightened
ven so, a strange shadow once ran through your eyes
ow, now too, little one, you bring me honeysuckle,
and even your breasts smell of it
hile the sad wind goes slaughtering butterflies
 love you, and my happiness bites the plum of your mouth
ow you must have suffered getting accustomed to me,
my savage, solitary soul, my name that sends them all running
o many times we have seen the morning star burn, kissing our eyes,
and over our heads the grey light unwinds in turning fans
y words rained over you, stroking you
 long time  have loved the sunned mother-of-pearl of your body
ntil  even believe that you own the universe
 will bring you happy flowers from the mountains, bluebells, dark hazels, and rustic baskets of kisses
 want to do with you what spring does with the cherry trees
ody of a woman, white hills, white thighs,
you look like a world, lying in surrender
y rough peasants body digs in you
and makes the son leap from the depth of the earth
 was lone like a tunnel he birds fled from me,
and nigh swamped me with its crushing invasion
o survive myself  forged you like a weapon,
like an arrow in my bow, a stone in my sling
ut the hour of vengeance falls, and  love you
ody of skin, of moss, of eager and firm milk
h the goblets of the breast h the eyes of absence
h the roses of the pubis h your voice, slow and sad
ody of my woman,  will persist in your grace
y thirst, my boundless desire, my shifting road
ark river-beds where the eternal thirst flows
and weariness follows, and the infinite ache
runk as drunk on turpentine
rom your open kisses,
our wet body wedged
etween my wet body and the strake
f our boat that is made of flowers,
easted, we guide it - our fingers
ike tallows adorned with yellow metal -
ver the skys hot rim,
he days last breath in our sails
inned by the sun between solstice
nd equinox, drowsy and tangled together
e drifted for months and woke
ith the bitter taste of land on our lips,
yelids all sticky, and we longed for lime
nd the sound of a rope
owering a bucket down its well hen,
e came by night to the ortunate sles,
nd lay like fish
nder the net of our kisses
 like for you to be still
t is as though you are absent
nd you hear me from far away
nd my voice does not touch you
t seems as though your eyes had flown away
nd it seems that a kiss had sealed your mouth
s all things are filled with my soul
ou emerge from the things
illed with my soul
ou are like my soul
 butterfly of dream
nd you are like the word elancholy
 like for you to be still
nd you seem far away
t sounds as though you are lamenting
 butterfly cooing like a dove
nd you hear me from far away
nd my voice does not reach you
et me come to be still in your silence
nd let me talk to you with your silence
hat is bright as a lamp
imple, as a ring
ou are like the night
ith its stillness and constellations
our silence is that of a star
s remote and candid
 like for you to be still
t is as though you are absent
istant and full of sorrow
o you wouldve died
ne word then, ne smile is enough
nd m happy
appy that its not true
 do not love you except because  love you
 go from loving to not loving you,
rom waiting to not waiting for you
y heart moves from cold to fire
 love you only because its you the one  love
 hate you deeply, and hating you
end to you, and the measure of my changing love for you
s that  do not see you but love you blindly
aybe anuary light will consume
y heart with its cruel
ay, stealing my key to true calm
n this part of the story  am the one who
ies, the only one, and  will die of love because  love you,
ecause  love you, ove, in fire and blood
y love, if you die and  dont--,
lets not give grief an even greater field
o expanse is greater than where we live
ust in the wheat, sand in the deserts,
time, wandering water, the vague wind
swept us like sailing seeds
e might not have found one another in time
his meadow where we find ourselves,
 little infinity we give it back
ut ove, this love has not ended
just as it never had a birth, it has
no death it is like a long river,
only changing lands, and changing lips
hen  cannot look at your face
 look at your feet
our feet of arched bone,
your hard little feet
 know that they support you,
and that your sweet weight
rises upon them
our waist and your breasts,
the doubled purple
of your nipples,
the sockets of your eyes
that have just flown away,
your wide fruit mouth,
your red tresses,
my little tower
ut  love your feet
only because they walked
upon the earth and upon
the wind and upon the waters,
until they found me
 am not jealous
of what came before me
ome with a man
on your shoulders,
come with a hundred men in your hair,
come with a thousand men between your breasts and your feet,
come like a river
full of drowned men
which flows down to the wild sea,
to the eternal surf, to ime
ring them all
to where  am waiting for you
we shall always be alone,
we shall always be you and 
alone on earth
to start our life
 can write the saddest poem of all tonight
rite, for instance he night is full of stars,
and the stars, blue, shiver in the distance
he night wind whirls in the sky and sings
 can write the saddest poem of all tonight
 loved her, and sometimes she loved me too
n nights like this,  held her in my arms
 kissed her so many times under the infinite sky
he loved me, sometimes  loved her
ow could  not have loved her large, still eyes?
 can write the saddest poem of all tonight
o think  dont have her o feel that ve lost her
o hear the immense night, more immense without her
nd the poem falls to the soul as dew to grass
hat does it matter that my love couldnt keep her
he night is full of stars and she is not with me
hats all ar away, someone sings ar away
y soul is lost without her
s if to bring her near, my eyes search for her
y heart searches for her and she is not with me
he same night that whitens the same trees
e, we who were, we are the same no longer
 no longer love her, true, but how much  loved her
y voice searched the wind to touch her ear
omeone elses he will be someone elses s she once
belonged to my kisses
er voice, her light body er infinite eyes
 no longer love her, true, but perhaps  love her
ove is so short and oblivion so long
ecause on nights like this  held her in my arms,
my soul is lost without her
lthough this may be the last pain she causes me,
and this may be the last poem  write for her
ont go far off, not even for a day
ont go far off, not even for a day,
ecause  dont know how to say it - a day is long
nd  will be waiting for you, as in
n empty station when the trains are
arked off somewhere else, asleep
ont leave me, even for an hour, because then
he little drops of anguish will all run together,
he smoke that roams looking for a home will drift
nto me, choking my lost heart
h, may your silhouette never dissolve
n the beach, may your eyelids never flutter
nto the empty distance ont  me for
 second, my dearest, because in that moment youll
ave gone so far ll wander mazily
ver all the earth, asking, will you
ome back? ill you leave me here, dying?
aked you are simple as one of your hands
mooth, earthy, small, transparent, round
ouve moon-lines, apple pathways
aked you are slender as a naked grain of wheat
aked you are blue as a night in uba
ouve vines and stars in your hair
aked you are spacious and yellow
s summer in a golden church
aked you are tiny as one of your nails
urved, subtle, rosy, till the day is born
nd you withdraw to the underground world
s if down a long tunnel of clothing and of chores
our clear light dims, gets dressed, drops its leaves,
nd becomes a naked hand again
onight  can write the saddest lines
rite, for example, he night is starry
and the stars are blue and shiver in the distance
he night wind revolves in the sky and sings
onight  can write the saddest lines
 loved her, and sometimes she loved me too
hrough nights like this one  held her in my arms
 kissed her again and again under the endless sky
he loved me, sometimes  loved her too
ow could one not have loved her great still eyes
onight  can write the saddest lines
o think that  do not have her o feel that  have lost her
o hear the immense night, still more immense without her
nd the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture
hat does it matter that my love could not keep her
he night is starry and she is not with me
his is all n the distance someone is singing n the distance
y soul is not satisfied that it has lost her
y sight tries to find her as though to bring her closer
y heart looks for her, and she is not with me
he same night whitening the same trees
e, of that time, are no longer the same
 no longer love her, thats certain, but how  loved her
y voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing
nothers he will be anothers s she was before my kisses
er voice, her bright body er infinite eyes
 no longer love her, thats certain, but maybe  love her
ove is so short, forgetting is so long
ecause through nights like this one  held her in my arms
my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her
hough this be the last pain that she makes me suffer
and these the last verses that  write for her
hats wrong with you, with us,
whats happening to us?
h our love is a harsh cord
that binds us wounding us
and if we want
to leave our wound,
to separate,
it makes a new knot for us and condemns us
to drain our blood and burn together
hats wrong with you?  look at you
and  find nothing in you but two eyes
like all eyes, a mouth
lost among a thousand mouths that  have kissed, more beautiful,
a body just like those that have slipped
beneath my body without leaving any memory
nd how empty you went through the world
like a wheat-colored jar
without air, without sound, without substance
 vainly sought in you
depth for my arms
that dig, without cease, beneath the earth
beneath your skin, beneath your eyes,
nothing,
beneath your double breast scarcely
raised
a current of crystalline order
that does not know why it flows singing
hy, why, why,
my love, why?
h vastness of pines, murmur of waves breaking,
slow play of lights, solitary bell,
twilight falling in your eyes, toy doll,
earth-shell, in whom the earth sings
n you the rivers sing and my soul flees in them
as you desire, and you send it where you will
im my road on your bow of hope
and in a frenzy  will flee my flock of arrows
n all sides  see your waist of fog,
and your silence hunts down my afflicted hours
my kisses anchor, and my moist desire nests
in your arms of transparent stone
h your mysterious voice that love tolls and darkens
in the resonant and dying evening
hus in the deep hours  have seen, over the fields,
the ears of wheat tolling in the mouth of the wind
ou are the daughter of the sea, oreganos first cousin
wimmer, your body is pure as the water
cook, your blood is quick as the soil
verything you do is full of flowers, rich with the earth
our eyes go out toward the water, and the waves rise
your hands go out to the earth and the seeds swell
you know the deep essence of water and the earth,
conjoined in you like a formula for clay
aiad cut your body into turquoise pieces,
they will bloom resurrected in the kitchen
his is how you become everything that lives
nd so at last, you sleep, in the circle of my arms
that push back the shadows so that you can rest--
vegetables, seaweed, herbs the foam of your dreams
 dont love you as if you were the salt-rose, topaz
or arrow of carnations that propagate fire
 love you as certain dark things are loved,
secretly, between the shadow and the soul
 love you as the plant that doesnt bloom and carries
hidden within itself the light of those flowers,
and thanks to your love, darkly in my body
lives the dense fragrance that rises from the earth
 love you without knowing how, or when, or from where,
 love you simply, without problems or pride
 love you in this way because  dont know any other way of loving
but this, in which there is no  or you,
so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand,
so intimate that when  fall asleep it is your eyes that close
he light wraps you in its mortal flame
bstracted pale mourner, standing that way
against the old propellers of the twighlight
that revolves around you
peechless, my friend,
alone in the loneliness of this hour of the dead
and filled with the lives of fire,
pure heir of the ruined day
 bough of fruit falls from the sun on your dark garment
he great roots of night
grow suddenly from your soul,
and the things that hide in you come out again
so that a blue and palled people
your newly born, takes nourishment
h magnificent and fecund and magnetic slave
of the circle that moves in turn through black and gold
rise, lead and possess a creation
so rich in life that its flowers perish
and it is full of sadness
ont go far off, not even for a day, because --
because --  dont know how to say it a day is long
and  will be waiting for you, as in an empty station
when the trains are parked off somewhere else, asleep
ont leave me, even for an hour, because
then the little drops of anguish will all run together,
the smoke that roams looking for a home will drift
into me, choking my lost heart
h, may your silhouette never dissolve on the beach
may your eyelids never flutter into the empty distance
ont leave me for a second, my dearest,
because in that moment youll have gone so far
ll wander mazily over all the earth, asking,
ill you come back? ill you leave me here, dying?
o that you will hear me
my words
sometimes grow thin

t was the twilight of the iguana
rom the rainbow-arch of the battlements,
his long tongue like a lance
sank down in the green leaves,
and a swarm of ants, monks with feet chanting,
crawled off into the jungle,
the guanaco, thin as oxygen
in the wide peaks of cloud,
went along, wearing his shoes of gold,
while the llama opened his honest eyes
on the breakable neatness
of a world full of dew
he monkeys braided a sexual
thread that went on and on
along the shores of dawn,
demolishing walls of pollen
and startling the butterflies of uzo
into flying violets
t was the night of the alligators,
the pure night, crawling
with snouts emrging from ooze,
and out the sleepy marshes
the confused noise of scaly plates
returned to the ground where they began
he jaguar brushed the leaves
with a luminous absence,
the puma runs through the branches
like a forest fire,
while the jungles drunken eyes
burn from inside him
he badgers scratch the rivers
feet, scenting the nest
whost throbbing delicacy
they attack with red teeth
nd deep in the huge waters
the enormous anaconda lies
like the circle around the earth,
covered with ceremonies of mud,
devouring, religious

sweetens a world
and the artichoke
dulcetly there in a gardenplot,
armed for a skirmish,
goes proud
in its pomegranate
burnishes

each by the other,
the artichoke moves
to its dream
of a market place
in the big willow
hoppers
a battle formation
ost warlike
of defilades-
with men
in the market stalls,
white shirts
in the soup-greens,
artichoke field marshals,
close-order conclaves,
commands, detonations,
and voices,
a crashing of crate staves
nd
aria
come
down
with her hamper
to
make trial
of an artichoke
she reflects, she examines,
she candles them up to the light like an egg,
never flinching
she bargains,
she tumbles her prize
in a market bag
among shoes and a
cabbage head,
a bottle
of vinegar is back
in her kitchen
he artichoke drowns in a pot
o you have it
a vegetable, armed,
a profession
call it an artichoke
whose end
is millennial
e taste of that
sweetness,
dismembering scale after scale

he tate sylum  was prejudiced
 wouldnt have sent anyone of mine there
ou know the old idea--the only asylum
as the poorhouse, and those who could afford,
ather than send their folks to such a place,
ept them at home and it does seem more human
ut its not so the place is the asylum
here they have every means proper to do with,
nd you arent darkening other peoples lives--
orse than no good to them, and they no good
o you in your condition you cant know
ffection or the want of it in that state
ve heard too much of the old-fashioned way
y fathers brother, he went mad quite young
ome thought he had been bitten by a dog,
ecause his violence took on the form
f carrying his pillow in his teeth
ut its more likely he was crossed in love,
r so the story goes t was some girl
nyway all he talked about was love
hey soon saw he would do someone a mischief
f he want kept strict watch of, and it ended
n fathers building him a sort of cage,
r room within a room, of hickory poles,
ike stanchions in the barn, from floor to ceiling,--
 narrow passage all the way around
nything they put in for furniture
ed tear to pieces, even a bed to lie on
o they made the place comfortable with straw,
ike a beasts stall, to ease their consciences
f course they had to feed him without dishes
hey tried to keep him clothed, but he paraded
ith his clothes on his arm--all of his clothes
ruel--it sounds  spose they did the best
hey knew nd just when he was at the height,
ather and mother married, and mother came,
 bride, to help take care of such a creature,
nd accommodate her young life to his
hat was what marrying father meant to her
he had to lie and hear love things made dreadful
y his shouts in the night ed shout and shout
ntil the strength was shouted out of him,
nd his voice died down slowly from exhaustion
ed pull his bars apart like bow and bow-string,
nd let them go and make them twang until
is hands had worn them smooth as any ox-bow
nd then hed crow as if he thought that childs play--
he only fun he had ve heard them say, though,
hey found a way to put a stop to it
e was before my time-- never saw him
ut the pen stayed exactly as it was
here in the upper chamber in the ell,
 sort of catch-all full of attic clutter
 often think of the smooth hickory bars
t got so  would say--you know, half fooling--
ts time  took my turn upstairs in jail--
ust as you will till it becomes a habit
o wonder  was glad to get away
ind you,  waited till en said the word
 didnt want the blame if things went wrong
 was glad though, no end, when we moved out,
nd  looked to be happy, and  was,
s  said, for a while--but  dont know
omehow the change wore out like a prescription
nd theres more to it than just window-views
nd living by a lake m past such help--
nless en took the notion, which he wont,
nd  wont ask him--its not sure enough
 spose ve got to go the road m going
ther folks have to, and why shouldnt ?
 almost think if  could do like you,
rop everything and live out on the ground--
ut it might be, come night,  shouldnt like it,
r a long rain  should soon get enough,
nd be glad of a good roof overhead
ve lain awake thinking of you, ll warrant,
ore than you have yourself, some of these nights

 havent courage for a risk like that
less you, of course, youre keeping me from work,
ut the thing of it is,  need to be kept
heres work enough to do--theres always that

 pass by that way in the gloaming with ary
 wonder,  say, who the owner of those is
h, no one you know, she answers me airy,
ut one we must ask if we want any roses
o we must join hands in the dew coming coldly
here in the hush of the wood that reposes,
nd turn and go up to the open door boldly,
nd knock to the echoes as beggars for roses
ray, are you within there, istress ho-were-you?
is ary that speaks and our errand discloses
ray, are you within there? estir you, bestir you
is summer again theres two come for roses
 word with you, that of the singer recalling--
ld errick a saying that every maid knows is
 flower unplucked is but left to the falling,
nd nothing is gained by not gathering roses
e do not loosen our hands intertwining
ot caring so very much what she supposes,
here when she comes on us mistily shining
nd grants us by silence the boon of her roses

here had  heard this wind before
hange like this to a deeper roar?
hat would it take my standing there for,
olding open a restive door,
ooking down hill to a frothy shore?
ummer was past and the day was past
ombre clouds in the west were massed
ut on the porchs sagging floor,
eaves got up in a coil and hissed,
lindly striking at my knee and missed
omething sinister in the tone

omehow must have gotten abroad,

hen  see birches bend to left and right
cross the lines of straighter darker trees,
 like to think some boys been swinging them
ut swinging doesnt bend them down to stay
ce-storms do that ften you must have seen them
oaded with ice a sunny winter morning
fter a rain hey click upon themselves
s the breeze rises, and turn many-coloured
s the stir cracks and crazes their enamel
oon the suns warmth makes them shed crystal shells
hattering and avalanching on the snow-crust
uch heaps of broken glass to sweep away
oud think the inner dome of heaven had fallen
hey are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,
nd they seem not to break though once they are bowed
o low for long, they never right themselves
ou may see their trunks arching in the woods
ears afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground,
ike girls on hands and knees that throw their hair
efore them over their heads to dry in the sun
ut  was going to say when ruth broke in
ith all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm,
 should prefer to have some boy bend them
s he went out and in to fetch the cows--
ome boy too far from town to learn baseball,
hose only play was what he found himself,
ummer or winter, and could play alone
ne by one he subdued his fathers trees
y riding them down over and over again
ntil he took the stiffness out of them,
nd not one but hung limp, not one was left
or him to conquer e learned all there was
o learn about not launching out too soon
nd so not carrying the tree away
lear to the ground e always kept his poise
o the top branches, climbing carefully
ith the same pains you use to fill a cup
p to the brim, and even above the brim
hen he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,
icking his way down through the air to the ground
o was  once myself a swinger of birches
nd so  dream of going back to be
ts when m weary of considerations,
nd life is too much like a pathless wood
here your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs
roken across it, and one eye is weeping
rom a twigs having lashed across it open
d like to get away from earth awhile
nd then come back to it and begin over
ay no fate willfully misunderstand me
nd half grant what  wish and snatch me away
ot to return arths the right place for love
 dont know where its likely to go better
d like to go by climbing a birch tree
nd climb black branches up a snow-white trunk
oward heaven, till the tree could bear no more,
ut dipped its top and set me down again
hat would be good both going and coming back
ne could do worse than be a swinger of birches

aking the gravel leap and leap in air,
eap up, like that, like that, and land so lightly
nd roll back down the mound beside the hole

ou could sit there with the stains on your shoes

he took the market things from arrens arms

ou neednt smile-- didnt recognise him--
 wasnt looking for him--and hes changed
ait till you see
here did you say hed been?
e didnt say  dragged him to the house,
nd gave him tea and tried to make him smoke
 tried to make him talk about his travels
othing would do he just kept nodding off
hat did he say? id he say anything?
ut little
nything? ary, confess
e said hed come to ditch the meadow for me
arren
ut did he?  just want to know
f course he did hat would you have him say?
urely you wouldnt grudge the poor old man
ome humble way to save his self-respect
e added, if you really care to know,
e meant to clear the upper pasture, too
hat sounds like something you have heard before?
arren,  wish you could have heard the way
e jumbled everything  stopped to look
wo or three times--he made me feel so queer--
o see if he was talking in his sleep
e ran on arold ilson--you remember--
he boy you had in haying four years since
es finished school, and teaching in his college
ilas declares youll have to get him back
e says they two will make a team for work
etween them they will lay this farm as smooth
he way he mixed that in with other things
e thinks young ilson a likely lad, though daft
n education--you know how they fought
ll through uly under the blazing sun,
ilas up on the cart to build the load,
arold along beside to pitch it on
es,  took care to keep well out of earshot
ell, those days trouble ilas like a dream
ou wouldnt think they would ow some things linger
arolds young college boys assurance piqued him
fter so many years he still keeps finding
ood arguments he sees he might have used
 sympathise  know just how it feels
o think of the right thing to say too late
arolds associated in his mind with atin
e asked me what  thought of arolds saying
e studied atin like the violin
ecause he liked it--that an argument
e said he couldnt make the boy believe
e could find water with a hazel prong--
hich showed how much good school had ever done him
e wanted to go over that ut most of all
e thinks if he could have another chance
o teach him how to build a load of hay----
 know, thats ilas one accomplishment
e bundles every forkful in its place,
nd tags and numbers it for future reference,
o he can find and easily dislodge it
n the unloading ilas does that well
e takes it out in bunches like big birds nests
ou never see him standing on the hay
es trying to lift, straining to lift himself
e thinks if he could teach him that, hed be
ome good perhaps to someone in the world
e hates to see a boy the fool of books

nd nothing to look forward to with hope,

es, what else but home?
t all depends on what you mean by home
f course hes nothing to us, any more

icked up a little stick, and brought it back
nd broke it in his hand and tossed it by
ilas has better claim on us you think
han on his brother? hirteen little miles
s the road winds would bring him to his door
ilas has walked that far no doubt to-day
hy didnt he go there? is brothers rich,
 somebody--director in the bank
e never told us that
e know it though
 think his brother ought to help, of course
ll see to that if there is need e ought of right
o take him in, and might be willing to--
e may be better than appearances
ut have some pity on ilas o you think
f hed had any pride in claiming kin
r anything he looked for from his brother,
ed keep so still about him all this time?
 wonder whats between them
 can tell you
ilas is what he is--we wouldnt mind him--
ut just the kind that kinsfolk cant abide
e never did a thing so very bad
e dont know why he isnt quite as good
s anyone e wont be made ashamed
o please his brother, worthless though he is
 cant think i ever hurt anyone
o, but he hurt my heart the way he lay
nd rolled his old head on that sharp-edged chair-back
e wouldnt let me put him on the lounge
ou must go in and see what you can do
 made the bed up for him there to-night
oull be surprised at him--how much hes broken
is working days are done m sure of it
d not be in a hurry to say that
 havent been o, look, see for yourself

o make it root again and grow afresh

rom too much dwelling on what has been
et for them the lilac renewed its leaf,
nd the aged elm, though touched with fire
nd the dry pump flung up an awkward arm
nd the fence post carried a strand of wire

ot to believe the phoebes wept

here is a singer eveyone has heard,
oud, a mid-summer and a mid-wood bird,
ho makes the solid tree trunks sound again
e says that leaves are old and that for flowers
id-summer is to spring as one to ten
e says the early petal-fall is past,
hen pear and cherry bloom went down in showers
n sunny days a moment overcast
nd comes that other fall we name the fall

efore it froze, and a gust flings a handful

ll have one if  sell my farm to buy it
here where he moved the rocks to plow the ground
nd plowed between the rocks he couldnt move,
ew farms changed hands so rather than spend years

e burned his house down for the fire insurance

he strongest thing thats given us to see withs

eems to me owes it to the town to keep one

fter such loose talk it was no surprise
hen he did what he did and burned his house down
ean laughter went about the town that day
o let him know we werent the least imposed on,
nd he could wait---wed see to him tomorrow
ut the first thing next morning we reflected
f one by one we counted people out
or the least sin, it wouldnt take us long
o get so we had no one left to live with
or to be social is to be forgiving
ur thief, the one who does our stealing from us,
e dont cut off from coming to church suppers,
ut what we miss we go to him and ask for
e promptly gives it back, that is if still
neaten, unworn out, or undisposed of
t wouldnt do to be too hard on rad
bout his telescope eyond the age
f being given one for hristmas gift,
e had to take the best way he knew how
o find himself in one ell, all we said was
e took a strange thing to be roguish over
ome sympathy was wasted on the house,
 good old-timer dating back along
ut a house isnt sentient the house
idnt feel anything nd if it did,
hy not regard it as a sacrifice,
nd an old-fashioned sacrifice by fire,

s on a farm, but planets, evening stars
hat varied in their hue from red to green
e got a good glass for six hundred dollars
is new job gave him leisure for stargazing
ften he bid me come and have a look
p the brass barrel, velvet black inside,
t a star quaking in the other end
 recollect a night of broken clouds
nd underfoot snow melted down to ice,
nd melting further in the wind to mud
radford and  had out the telescope
e spread our two legs as we spread its three,
ointed our thoughts the way we pointed it,
nd standing at our leisure till the day broke,
aid some of the best things we ever said
hat telescope was christened the tar-plitter,
ecause it didnt do a thing but split
 star in two or three, the way you split
 globule of quicksilver in your hand
ith one stroke of your finger in the middle
ts a star-splitter if there ever was one,
nd ought to do some good if splitting stars
a thing to be compared with splitting wood

ut he had gone his way, the grass all mown,

s all must be,  said within my heart,
hether they work together or apart
ut as  said it, swift there passed me by
n noiseless wing a bewildered butterfly,
eeking with memories grown dim over night
ome resting flower of yesterdays delight
nd once  marked his flight go round and round,
s where some flower lay withering on the ground
nd then he flew as far as eye could see,
nd then on tremulous wing came back to me
 thought of questions that have no reply,
nd would have turned to toss the grass to dry
ut he turned first, and led my eye to look
t a tall tuft of flowers beside a brook,
 leaping tongue of bloom the scythe had spared
eside a reedy brook the scythe had bared
 left my place to know them by their name,
inding them butterfly-weed when  came
he mower in the dew had loved them thus,
y leaving them to flourish, not for us,
or yet to draw one thought of ours to him,
ut from sheer morning gladness at the brim
he butterfly and  had lit upon,
evertheless, a message from the dawn,
hat made me hear the wakening birds around,
nd hear his long scythe whispering to the ground,
nd feel a spirit kindred to my own
o that henceforth  worked no more alone
ut glad with him,  worked as with his aid,
nd weary, sought at noon with him the shade

 little further up the mountain side

ith rock and washout, and unsafe in darkness

pending what onward impulse they still had
n ne last look the way they must not go,

ike some up-ended boulder split in two,
as in her clouded eyes they saw no fear there
he seemed to think that two thus they were safe
hen, as if they were something that, though strange,
he could not trouble her mind with too long,
he sighed and passed unscared along the wall
his, then, is all hat more is there to ask?
ut no, not yet  snort to bid them wait
 buck from round the spruce stood looking at them
cross the wall as near the wall as they
his was an antlered buck of lusty nostril,

o stretch a proffering hand -- and a spell-breaking
hen he too passed unscared along the wall

here in this valley of discrete academies
we have not mountains, but mounts, truncated hillocks
to the adirondacks, to northern monadnock,
themselves mere rocky hillocks to an everest
still, theyre out best mustering of height by
comparison with the sunnken silver-grizzled
back of the connecticut, the river-level
flats of hadley farms, theyre lofty enough
elevations to be called something more than hills
green, wholly green, they stand their knobby spine
against our sky they are what we look southward to
up pleasant street at main poising their shapes
between the snuff and red tar-paper apartments,
they mound a summer coolness in our view
to people who live in the bottom of valleys
a rise in the landscape, hummock or hogback, looks
to be meant for climbing a peculiar logic
in going up for the coming down if the post
we start ats the same post we finish by,
but its the clear conversion at the top can hold
us to the oblique road, in spite of a fitful
wish for even ground, and its the last cliff
ledge will dislodge out cramped concept of space, unwall
horizons beyond vision, spill vision
after the horizons, stretching the narrowed eye
to full capacity we climb to hopes
of such seeing up the leaf-shuttered escarpments,
blindered by green, under a green-grained sky
into the blue tops define themselves as places
where nothing highers to be looked to downward looks
follow the black arrow-backs of swifts on their track
of the air eddies loop and arc though airs at rest
to us, since we see no leaf edge stir high
here on a mount overlaid with leaves the paint-peeled
hundred-year-old hotel sustains its ramshackle
four-way veranda, view-keeping above
the fallen timbers of its once remarkable
funicular railway, witness to gone
time, and to graces gone with the time a state view-
keeper collects half-dollars for the slopes
of state scenery, sells soda, shows off viewpoints
a ruffy skylight oaints the gray oxbow
and paints the rivers pale circumfluent stillness
as roses broach their carmine in a mirror flux
of the desultory currents --- all that unique
stripple of shifting wave-tips is ironed out, lost
in the simplified orderings of sky-
lorded perspectives maplike, the far fields are ruled
by correct green lines and no seedy free-for-all
of asparagus heads cars run their suave
colored beads on the strung roads, and the people stroll
straightforwardly across the springing green
alls peace and discipline down there till lately we
lived under the shadow of hot rooftops
and never saw how coolly we might move for once
a high hush quietens the crickets cry
the smile of iceboxes annihilates me
such blue currents in the veins of my loved one
i hear her great heart purr
from her lips ampersands and percent signs
exit like kisses
it is monday in her mind morals
launder and present themselves
what am i to make of these contradictions?
i wear white cuffs, i bow
is this love then, this red material
issuing from the steele needle that flies so blindingly?
it will make little dresses and coats,
it will cover a dynasty
how her body opens and shuts-
a swiss watch, jeweled in the hinges
o heart, such disorganization
the stars are flashing like terrible numerals
abc, her eyelids say
spry, wry, and gray as these march sticks,
percy bows, in his blue peajacket, among the narcissi
he is recuperating from something on the lung
the narcissi, too, are bowing to some big thing
it rattles their stars on the green hill where percy
nurses the hardship of his stitches, and walks and walks
there is a dignity to this there is a formality-
the flowers vivid as bandages, and the man mending
they bow and stand  they suffer such attacks
and the octogenarian loves the little flocks
he is quite blue the terrible wind tries his breathing
the narcissi look up like children, quickly and whitely
clocks cry stillness is a lie, my dear
the wheels revolve, the universe keeps running
proud you halt upon the spiral stair
the asteroids turn traitor in the air,
and planets plot with old elliptic cunning
clocks cry stillness is a lie, my dear
red the unraveled rose sings in your hair
blood springs eternal if the heart be burning
proud you halt upon the spiral stair
cryptic stars wind up the atmosphere,
in solar schemes the titled suns go turning
clocks cry stillness is a lie, my dear
loud the immortal nightingales declare
love flames forever if the flesh be yearning
proud you halt upon the spiral stair
circling zodiac compels the year
intolerant beauty never will be learning
clocks cry stillness is a lie, my dear
proud you halt upon the spiral stair
love set you going like a fat gold watch
the midwife slapped your footsoles, and your bald cry
took its place among the elements
our voices echo, magnifying your arrival  new statue
in a drafty museum, your nakedness
shadows our safety  we stand round blankly as walls
im no more your mother
than the cloud that distills a mirror to reflect its own slow
effacement at the winds hand
all night your moth-breath
flickers among the flat pink roses  i wake to listen
a far sea moves in my ear
one cry, and i stumble from bed, cow-heavy and floral
in my victorian nightgown
your mouth opens clean as a cats  the window square
whitens and swallows its dull stars  and now you try
your handful of notes
the clear vowels rise like balloons
old man, you surface seldom
then you come in with the tides
coming
when seas wash cold, foam-
capped white hair, white beard,
far-flung,
a dragnet, rising, falling, as waves
crest and trough miles long
extend the radial sheaves
of your spread hair, in which wrin-
kling skeins
knotted, caught, survives
the old myth of orgins
unimaginable you float near
as kneeled ice-mountains
of the north, to be steered clear
of, not fathomed all obscurity
starts with a danger
your dangers are many i
cannot look much but your form
suffers
some strange injury
and seems to die so vapors
ravel to clearness on the dawn sea
the muddy rumors
of your burial move me
to half-believe your reappearance
proves rumors shallow,
for the archaic trenched lines
of your grained face shed time in
runnels
ages beat like rains
on the unbeaten channels
of the ocean such sage humor
and
durance are whirlpools
to make away with the ground-
work of the earth and the skys
ridgepole
waist down, you may wind
one labyrinthine tangle
to root deep among knuckles, shin-
bones,
skulls inscrutable,
below shoulders not once
seen by any man who kept his head,
you defy questions
you defy godhood
i walk dry on your kingdoms border
exiled to no good
your shelled bed i remember
father, this thick air is murderous
i would breathe water
arena dust rusted by four bulls blood to a dull redness,
the afternoon at a bad end under the crowds truculence,
the ritual death each time botched among dropped capes, ill-judged
stabs,
the strongest will seemed a will towards ceremony obese, dark-
faced in his rich yellows, tassels, pompons, braid, the picador
rode out against the fifth bull to brace his pike and slowly bear
down deep into the bent bull-neck cumbrous routine, not artwork
instinct for art began with the bulls horn lofting in the mobs
hush a lumped man-shape the whole act formal, fluent as a dance
blood faultlessly broached redeemed the sullied air, the earths grossness
now coldness comes sifting down, layer after layer,
to our bower at the lily root
overhead the old umbrellas of summer
wither like pithless hands there is little shelter
hourly the eye of the sky enlarges its blank
dominion the stars are no nearer
already frog-mouth and fish-mouth drink
the liquor of indolence, and all thing sink
into a soft caul of forgetfulness
the fugitive colors die
caddis worms drowse in their silk cases,
the lamp-headed nymphs are nodding to sleep like statues
puppets, loosed from the strings of the puppetmaster
wear masks of horn to bed
this is not death, it is something safer
the wingy myths wont tug at us anymore
the molts are tongueless that sang from above the water
of golgotha at the tip of a reed,
and how a god flimsy as a babys finger
shall unhusk himself and steer into the air
he, hunger-strung, hard to slake,
so fitted is for my black luck
with heat such as no man could have
and yet keep kind
that all merits in being meat
seasoned how hed most approve
bloods broth
filched by his hand,
choice wassail makes, cooked hot,
cupped quick to mouth
though prime parts cram each rich meal,
hell not spare
nor scant his want until
sacked larders gone bone-bare
all day she plays at chess with the bones of the world
favored while suddenly the rains begin
beyond the window she lies on cushions curled
and nibbles an occasional bonbon of sin
prim, pink-breasted, feminine, she nurses
chocolate fancies in rose-papered rooms
where polished higboys whisper creaking curses
and hothouse roses shed immortal blooms
the garnets on her fingers twinkle quick
and blood reflects across the manuscript
she muses on the odor, sweet and sick,
of festering gardenias in a crypt,
and lost in subtle metaphor, retreats
from gray child faces crying in the streets
mother, mother, what illbred aunt
or what disfigured and unsightly
cousin did you so unwisely keep
unasked to my christening, that she
sent these ladies in her stead
with heads like darning-eggs to nod
and nod and nod at foot and head
and at the left side of my crib?
mother, who made to order stories
of mixie blackshort the heroic bear,
mother, whose witches always, always,
got baked into gingerbread, i wonder
whether you saw them, whether you said
words to rid me of those three ladies
nodding by night around my bed,
mouthless, eyeless, with stitched bald head
in the hurricane, when fathers twelve
study windows bellied in
like bubbles about to break, you fed
my brother and me cookies and ovaltine
and helped the two of us to choir
thor is angry boom boom boom
thor is angry we dont care
but those ladies broke the panes
when on tiptoe the schoolgirls danced,
blinking flashlights like fireflies
and singing the glowworm song, i could
not lift a foot in the twinkle-dress
but, heavy-footed, stood aside
in the shadow cast by my dismal-headed
godmothers, and you cried and cried
and the shadow stretched, the lights went out
mother, you sent me to piano lessons
and praised my arabesques and trills
although each teacher found my touch
oddly wooden in spite of scales
and the hours of practicing, my ear
tone-deaf and yes, unteachable
i learned, i learned, i learned elsewhere,
from muses unhired by you, dear mother,
i woke one day to see you, mother,
floating above me in bluest air
on a green balloon bright with a million
flowers and bluebirds that never were
never, never, found anywhere
but the little planet bobbed away
like a soap-bubble as you called come here
and i faced my traveling companions
day now, night now, at head, side, feet,
they stand their vigil in gowns of stone,
faces blank as the day i was born,
their shadows long in the setting sun
that never brightens or goes down
and this is the kingdom you bore me to,
mother, mother but no frown of mine
will betray the company i keep
how far is it?
how far is it now?
the gigantic gorilla interior
of the wheels move, they appall me ---
the terrible brains
of krupp, black muzzles
revolving, the sound
punching out absence like cannon
it is russia i have to get across, it is some was or other
i am dragging my body
quietly through the straw of the boxcars
now is the time for bribery
what do wheels eat, these wheels
fixed to their arcs like gods,
the silver leash of the will ----
inexorable and their pride
all the gods know destinations
i am a letter in this slot
i fly to a name, two eyes
will there be fire, will there be bread?
here there is such mud
it is a trainstop, the nurses
undergoing the faucet water, its veils, veils in a nunnery,
touching their wounded,
the men the blood still pumps forward,
legs, arms piled outside
the tent of unending cries ----
a hospital of dolls
and the men, what is left of the men
pumped ahead by these pistons, this blood
into the next mile,
the next hour ----
dynasty of broken arrows
how far is it?
there is mud on my feet,
thick, red and slipping it is adams side,
this earth i rise from, and i in agony
i cannot undo myself, and the train is steaming
steaming and breathing, its teeth
ready to roll, like a devils
there is a minute at the end of it
a minute, a dewdrop
how far is it?
it is so small
the place i am getting to, why are there these obstacles ----
the body of this woman,
charred skirts and deathmask
mourned by religious figures, by garlanded children
and now detonations ----
thunder and guns
the fires between us
is there no place
turning and turning in the middle air,
untouchable and untouchable
the train is dragging itself, it is screaming ----
an animal
insane for the destination,
the bloodspot,
the face at the end of the flare
i shall bury the wounded like pupas,
i shall count and bury the dead
let their souls writhe in like dew,
incense in my track
the carriages rock, they are cradles
and i, stepping from this skin
of old bandages, boredoms, old faces
step up to you from the black car of lethe,
pure as a baby
this is a dark house, very big
i made it myself,
cell by cell from a quiet corner,
chewing at the grey paper,
oozing the glue drops,
whistling, wiggling my ears,
thinking of something else
it has so many cellars,
such eelish delvings
u an round as an owl,
i see by my own light
any day i may litter puppies
or mother a horse my belly moves
i must make more maps
these marrowy tunnels
moley-handed, i eat my way
all-mouth licks up the bushes
and the pots of meat
he lives in an old well,
a stoney hole hes to blame
hes a fat sort
pebble smells, turnipy chambers
small nostrils are breathing
little humble loves
footlings, boneless as noses,
it is warm and tolerable
in the bowel of the root
heres a cuddly mother
always in the middle of a kiss
came the profane stimulus to cough
always from teh pulpit during service
leaned the devil prompting you to laugh
behind mock-ceremony of your grief
lurked the burlesque instinct of the ham
you never altered your amused belief
that life was a mere monumental sham
from the comic accident of birth
to the final grotesque joke of death
your malady of sacrilegious mirth
spread gay contagion with each clever breath
now you must play the straight man for a term
and tolerate the humor of the worm
now we, returning from the vaulted domes
of our colossal sleep, come home to find
a tall metropolis of catacombs
erected down the gangways of our mind
green alleys where we reveled have become
the infernal haunt of demon dangers
both seraph song and violins are dumb
each clock tick consecrates the death of strangers
backward we traveled to reclaim the day
before we fell, like icarus, undone
all we find are altars in decay
and profane words scrawled black across the sun
still, stubbornly we try to crack the nut
in which the riddle of our race is shut
outside in the street i hear
a car door slam voices coming near
incoherent scraps of talk
and high heels clicking up the walk
the doorbell rends the noonday heat
with copper claws
a seconds pause
the dull drums of my pulses beat
against a silence wearing thin
the door now opens from within
oh, hear the clash of people meeting ---
the laughter and the screams of greeting
fat always, and out of breath,
a greasy smack on every cheek
from aunt elizabeth
there, thats the pink, pleased squeak
of cousin jane, out spinster with
the faded eyes
and hands like nervous butterflies
while rough as splintered wood
across them all
rasps the jarring baritone of uncle paul
the youngest nephew gives a fretful whine
and drools at the reception line
like a diver on a lofty spar of land
atop the flight of stairs i stand
a whirlpool leers at me,
i cast off my identity
and make the fatal plunge
the day you died i went into the dirt,
into the lightless hibernaculum
where bees, striped black and gold, sleep out the blizzard
like hieratic stones, and the ground is hard
it was good for twenty years, that wintering -
as if you never existed, as if i came
god-fathered into the world from my mothers belly
her wide bed wore the stain of divinity
i had nothing to do with guilt or anything
when i wormed back under my mothers heart
small as a doll in my dress of innocence
i lay dreaming your epic, image by image
nobody died or withered on that stage
everything took place in a durable whiteness
the day i woke, i woke on churchyard hill
i found your name, i found your bones and all
enlisted in a cramped stone askew by an iron fence
in this charity ward, this poorhouse, where the dead
crowd foot to foot, head to head, no flower
breaks the soil this is azalea path
a field of burdock opens to the south
six feet of yellow gravel cover you
the artificial red sage does not stir
in the basket of plastic evergreens they put
at the headstone next to yours, nor does it rot,
although the rains dissolve a bloody dye
the ersatz petals drip, and they drip red
another kind of redness bothers me
the day your slack sail drank my sisters breath
the flat sea purpled like that evil cloth
my mother unrolled at your last homecoming
i borrow the silts of an old tragedy
the truth is, one late october, at my birth-cry
a scorpion stung its head, an ill-starred thing
my mother dreamed you face down in the sea
the stony actors poise and pause for breath
i brought my love to bear, and then you died
it was the gangrene ate you to the bone
my mother said you died like any man
how shall i age into that state of mind?
i am the ghost of an infamous suicide,
my own blue razor rusting at my throat
o pardon the one who knocks for pardon at
your gate, father - your hound-bitch, daughter, friend
it was my love that did us both to death
how the elements solidify ---
the moonlight, that chalk cliff
in whose rift we lie
back to back i here an owl cry
from its cold indigo
intolerable vowels enter my heart
the child in the white crib revolves and sighs,
opens its mouth now, demanding
his little face is carved in pained, red wood
then there are the stars - ineradicable, hard
one touch  it burns and sickens
i cannot see your eyes
where apple bloom ices the night
i walk in a ring,
a groove of old faults, deep and bitter
love cannot come here
a black gap discloses itself
on the opposite lip
a small white soul is waving, a small white maggot
my limbs, also, have left me
who has dismembered us?
the dark is melting we touch like cripples
what a thrill ---
my thumb instead of an onion
the top quite gone
except for a sort of a hinge
of skin,
a flap like a hat,
dead white
then that red plush
little pilgrim,
the indians axed your scalp
your turkey wattle
carpet rolls
straight from the heart
i step on it,
clutching my bottle
of pink fizz
a celebration, this is
out of a gap
a million soldiers run,
redcoats, every one
whose side are they on?
o my
homunculus, i am ill
i have taken a pill to kill
the thin
papery feeling
saboteur,
kamikaze man ---
the stain on your
gauze ku klux klan
babushka
darkens and tarnishes and when
the balled
pulp of your heart
confronts its small
mill of silence
how you jump ---
trepanned veteran,
dirty girl,
thumb stump
in benidorm there are melons,
whole donkey-carts full
of innumerable melons,
ovals and balls,
bright green and thumpable
laced over with stripes
of turtle-dark green
chooose an egg-shape, a world-shape,
bowl one homeward to taste
in the whitehot noon
cream-smooth honeydews,
pink-pulped whoppers,
bump-rinded cantaloupes
with orange cores
each wedge wears a studding
of blanched seeds or black seeds
to strew like confetti
under the feet of
this market of melon-eating
fiesta-goers
gold mouths cry with the green young
certainty of the bronze boy
remembering a thousand autumns
and how a hundred thousand leaves
came sliding down his shoulder blades
persuaded by his bronze heroic reason
we ignore the coming doom of gold
and we are glad in this bright metal season
even the dead laugh among the goldenrod
the bronze boy stands kneedeep in centuries,
and never grieves,
remembering a thousand autumns,
with sunlight of a thousand years upon his lips
and his eyes gone blind with leaves
thou shalt have an everlasting
monday and stand in the moon
the moons man stands in his shell,
bent under a bundle
of sticks the light falls chalk and cold
upon our bedspread
his teeth are chattering among the leprous
peaks and craters of those extinct volcanoes
he also against black frost
would pick sticks, would not rest
until his own lit room outshone
sundays ghost of sun
now works his hell of mondays in the moons ball,
fireless, seven chill seas chained to his ankle
i have done it again
one year in every ten
i manage it--
a sort of walking miracle, my skin
bright as a nazi lampshade,
my right foot
a paperweight,
my face featureless, fine
jew linen
peel off the napkin
o my enemy
do i terrify?--
the nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?
the sour breath
will vanish in a day
soon, soon the flesh
the grave cave ate will be
at home on me
and i a smiling woman
i am only thirty
and like the cat i have nine times to die
this is number three
what a trash
to annihilate each decade
what a million filaments
the peanut-crunching crowd
shoves in to see
them unwrap me hand and foot--
the big strip tease
gentlemen, ladies
these are my hands
my knees
i may be skin and bone,
nevertheless, i am the same, identical woman
the first time it happened i was ten
it was an accident
the second time i meant
to last it out and not come back at all
i rocked shut
as a seashell
they had to call and call
and pick the worms off me like sticky pearls
dying
is an art, like everything else
i do it exceptionally well
i do it so it feels like hell
i do it so it feels real
i guess you could say ive a call
its easy enough to do it in a cell
its easy enough to do it and stay put
its the theatrical
comeback in broad day
to the same place, the same face, the same brute
amused shout
a miracle
that knocks me out
there is a charge
for the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge
for the hearing of my heart--
it really goes
and there is a charge, a very large charge
for a word or a touch
or a bit of blood
or a piece of my hair or my clothes
so, so, herr doktor
so, herr enemy
i am your opus,
i am your valuable,
the pure gold baby
that melts to a shriek
i turn and burn
do not think i underestimate your great concern
ash, ash--
you poke and stir
flesh, bone, there is nothing there--
a cake of soap,
a wedding ring,
a gold filling
herr god, herr lucifer
beware
beware
out of the ash
i rise with my red hair
and i eat men like air
viciousness in the kitchen
the potatoes hiss
it is all hollywood, windowless,
the fluorescent light wincing on and off like a terrible migraine,
coy paper strips for doors
stage curtains, a widows frizz
and i, love, am a pathological liar,
and my child look at her, face down on the floor,
little unstrung puppet, kicking to disappear
why she is schizophrenic,
her face is red and white, a panic,
you have stuck her kittens outside your window
in a sort of cement well
where they crap and puke and cry and she cant hear
you say you cant stand her,
the bastards a girl
you who have blown your tubes like a bad radio
clear of voices and history, the staticky
noise of the new
you say i should drown the kittens their smell
you say i should drown my girl
shell cut her throat at ten if shes mad at two
the baby smiles, fat snail,
from the polished lozenges of orange linoleum
you could eat him hes a boy
you say your husband is just no good to you
his jew-mama guards his sweet sex like a pearl
you have one baby, i have two
i should sit on a rock off cornwall and comb my hair
i should wear tiger pants, i should have an affair
we should meet in another life, we should meet in air,
me and you
meanwhile theres a stink of fat and baby crap
im doped and thick from my last sleeping pill
the smog of cooking, the smog of hell
floats our heads, two venemous opposites,
our bones, our hair
i call you orphan, orphan you are ill
the sun gives you ulcers, the wind gives you tb
once you were beautiful
in new york, in hollywood, the men said through?
gee baby, you are rare
you acted, acted for the thrill
the impotent husband slumps out for a coffee
i try to keep him in,
an old pole for the lightning,
the acid baths, the skyfuls off of you
he lumps it down the plastic cobbled hill,
flogged trolley the sparks are blue
the blue sparks spill,
splitting like quartz into a million bits
o jewel o valuable
that night the moon
dragged its blood bag, sick
animal
up over the harbor lights
and then grew normal,
hard and apart and white
the scale-sheen on the sand scared me to death
we kept picking up handfuls, loving it,
working it like dough, a mulatto body,
the silk grits
a dog picked up your doggy husband he went on
now i am silent, hate
up to my neck,
thick, thick
i do not speak
i am packing the hard potatoes like good clothes,
i am packing the babies,
i am packing the sick cats
o vase of acid,
it is love you are full of you know who you hate
he is hugging his ball and chain down by the gate
that opens to the sea
where it drives in, white and black,
then spews it back
every day you fill him with soul-stuff, like a pitcher
you are so exhausted
your voice my ear-ring,
flapping and sucking, blood-loving bat
that is that that is that
you peer from the door,
sad hag every womans a whore
i cant communicate
i see your cute decor
close on you like the fist of a baby
or an anemone, that sea
sweetheart, that kleptomaniac
i am still raw
i say i may be back
you know what lies are for
even in your zen heaven we shant meet
this man makes a pseudonym
and crawls behind it like a worm
this woman on the telephone
says she is a man, not a woman
the mask increases, eats the worm,
stripes for mouth and eyes and nose,
the voice of the woman hollows---
more and more like a dead one,
worms in the glottal stops
she hates
the thought of a baby---
stealer of cells, stealer of beauty---
she would rather be dead than fat,
dead and perfect, like nefertit,
hearing the fierce mask magnify
the silver limbo of each eye
where the child can never swim,
where there is only him and him
pocket watch, i tick well
the streets are lizardy crevices
sheer-sided, with holes where to hide
it is best to meet in a cul-de-sac,
a palace of velvet
with windows of mirrors
there one is safe,
there are no family photographs,
no rings through the nose, no cries
bright fish hooks, the smiles of women
gulp at my bulk
and i, in my snazzy blacks,
mill a litter of breasts like jellyfish
to nourish
the cellos of moans i eat eggs -
eggs and fish, the essentials,
the aphrodisiac squid
my mouth sags,
the mouth of christ
when my engine reaches the end of it
the tattle of my
gold joints, my way of turning
bitches to ripples of silver
rolls out a carpet, a hush
and there is no end, no end of it
i shall never grow old new oysters
shriek in the sea and i
glitter like fontainebleau
gratified,
all the fall of water and eye
over whose pool i tenderly
lean and see me
we came over the moor-top
through air streaming and green-lit,
stone farms foundering in it,
valleys of grass altering
in a light neither dawn
nor nightfall, out hands, faces
lucent as percelain, the earths
claim and weight gone out of them
some such transfiguring moved
the eight pilgrims towards its source--
toward the great jewel shown often,
never given hidden, yet
simultaneously seen
on moor-top, at sea-bottom,
knowable only by light
other than noon, that moon, stars ---
the once-known way becoming
wholly other, and ourselves
estranged, changed, suspended where
angels are rumored, clearly
floating , among the floating
tables and chairs gravitys
lost in the lift and drift of
an easier element
than earth, and there is nothing
so fine we cannot do it
but nearing means distancing
at the common homecoming
light withdraws chairs, tables drop
down the body weighs like stone
it is no night to drown in
a full moon, river lapsing
black beneath bland mirror-sheen,
the blue water-mists dropping
scrim after scrim like fishnets
though fishermen are sleeping,
the massive castle turrets
doubling themselves in a glass
all stillness yet these shapes float
up toward me, troubling the face
of quiet from the nadir
they rise, their limbs ponderous
with richness, hair heavier
than sculptured marble they sing
of a world more full and clear
than can be sisters, your song
bears a burden too weighty
for the whorled ears listening
here, in a well-steered country,
under a balanced ruler
deranging by harmony
beyond the mundane order,
your voices lay siege you lodge
on the pitched reefs of nightmare,
promising sure harborage
by day, descant from borders
of hebetude, from the ledge
also of high windows worse
even than your maddening
song, your silence at the source
of your ice-hearted calling-
drunkenness of the great depths
o river, i see drifting
deep in your flux of silver
those great goddesses of peace
stone, stone, ferry me down there
kindness glides about my house
dame kindness, she is so nice
the blue and red jewels of her rings smoke
in the windows, the mirrors
are filling with smiles
what is so real as the cry of a child?
a rabbits cry may be wilder
but it has no soul
sugar can cure everything, so kindness says
sugar is a necessary fluid,
its crystals a little poultice
o kindness, kindness
sweetly picking up pieces
my japanese silks, desperate butterflies,
may be pinned any minute, anesthetized
and here you come, with a cup of tea
wreathed in steam
the blood jet is poetry,
there is no stopping it
you hand me two children, two roses
a villanelle
the sting of bees took away my father
who walked in a swarming shroud of wings
and scorned the tick of the falling weather
lightning licked in a yellow lather
but missed the mark with snaking fangs
the sting of bees too away my father
trouncing the sea like a ragin bather,
he rode the flood in a pride of prongs
and scorned the tick of the falling weather
a scowl of sun struck down my mother,
tolling her grave with golden gongs,
but the sting of bees took away my father
he counted the guns of god a bother,
laughed at the ambush of angels tongues,
and scorned the tick of the falling weather
o ransack the four winds and find another
man who can mangle the grin of kings
the sting of bees took away my father
who scorned the tick of the falling weather
the night is only a sort of carbon paper,
blueblack, with the much-poked periods of stars
letting in the light, peephole after peephole ---
a bonewhite light, like death, behind all things
under the eyes of the stars and the moons rictus
he suffers his desert pillow, sleeplessness
stretching its fine, irritating sand in all directions
over and over the old, granular movie
exposes embarrassments--the mizzling days
of childhood and adolescence, sticky with dreams,
parental faces on tall stalks, alternately stern and tearful,
a garden of buggy rose that made him cry
his forehead is bumpy as a sack of rocks
memories jostle each other for face-room like obsolete film stars
he is immune to pills red, purple, blue ---
how they lit the tedium of the protracted evening
those sugary planets whose influence won for him
a life baptized in no-life for a while,
and the sweet, drugged waking of a forgetful baby
now the pills are worn-out and silly, like classical gods
their poppy-sleepy colors do him no good
his head is a little interior of grey mirrors
each gesture flees immediately down an alley
of diminishing perspectives, and its significance
drains like water out the hole at the far end
he lives without privacy in a lidless room,
the bald slots of his eyes stiffened wide-open
on the incessant heat-lightning flicker of situations
nightlong, in the granite yard, invisible cats
have been howling like women, or damaged instruments
already he can feel daylight, his white disease,
creeping up with her hatful of trivial repetitions
the city is a map of cheerful twitters now,
and everywhere people, eyes mica-silver and blank,
are riding to work in rows, as if recently brainwashed
but i would rather be horizontal
i am not a tree with my root in the soil
sucking up minerals and motherly love
so that each march i may gleam into leaf,
nor am i the beauty of a garden bed
attracting my share of ahs and spectacularly painted,
unknowing i must soon unpetal
compared with me, a tree is immortal
and a flower-head not tall, but more startling,
and i want the ones longevity and the others daring
tonight, in the infinitesimallight of the stars,
the trees and the flowers have been strewing their cool odors
i walk among them, but none of them are noticing
sometimes i think that when i am sleeping
i must most perfectly resemble them--
thoughts gone dim
it is more natural to me, lying down
then the sky and i are in open conversation,
and i shall be useful when i lie down finally
then the trees may touch me for once, and the flowers have time for me
you bring me good news from the clinic,
whipping off your silk scarf, exhibiting the tight white
mummy-cloths, smiling im all right
when i was nine, a lime-green anesthetist
fed me banana gas through a frog-mask the nauseous vault
boomed wild bad dreams and the jovian voices of surgeons
the mother swam up, holding a tin basin
o i was sick
theyve changed all that traveling
nude as cleopatra in my well-boiled hospital shift,
fizzy with sedatives and unusually humorous,
i roll to an anteroom where a kind man
fists my fingers for me he makes me feel something precious
is leaking from the finger-vents at the count of two
darkness wipes me out like chalk on a blackboard
i dont know a thing
for five days i lie in secret,
tapped like a cask, the years draining into my pillow
even my best friend thinks im in the country
skin doesnt have roots, it peels away easy as paper
when i grin, the stitches tauten i grow backward im twenty,
broody and in long skirts on my first husbands sofa, my fingers
buried in the lambswool of the dead poodle
i hadnt a cat yet
now shes done for, the dewlapped lady
i watched settle, line by line, in my mirror ---
old sock-face, sagged on a darning egg
theyve trapped her in some laboratory jar
let her die there, or whither incessantly for the next fifty years,
nodding and rocking and fingering her thin hair
mother to myself, i wake swaddled in gauze,
pink and smooth as a baby
you will be aware of an absence, presently,
growing beside you, like a tree,
a death tree, color gone, an australian gum tree ---
balding, gelded by lightning--an illusion,
and a sky like a pigs backside, an utter lack of attention
but right now you are dumb
and i love your stupidity,
the blind mirror of it i look in
and find no face but my own, and you think thats funny
it is good for me
to have you grab my nose, a ladder rung
one day you may touch whats wrong ---
the small skulls, the smashed blue hills, the godawful hush
till then your smiles are found money
this was the lands end the last fingers, knuckled and rheumatic,
cramped on nothing black
admonitory cliffs, and the sea exploding
with no bottom, or anything on the other side of it,
whitened by the faces of the drowned
now it is only gloomy, a dump of rocks ---
leftover soldiers from old, messy wars
the sea cannons into their ear, but they dont budge
other rocks hide their grudges under the water
the cliffs are edged with trefoils, stars and bells
such as fingers might embroider, close to death,
almost too small for the mists to bother with
the mists are part of the ancient paraphernalia ---
souls, rolled in the doom-noise of the sea
they bruise the rocks out of existence, then resurrect them
they go up without hope, like sighs
i walk among them, and they stuff my mouth with cotton
when they free me, i am beaded with tears
our lady of the shipwrecked is striding toward the horizon,
her marble skirts blown back in two pink wings
a marble sailor kneels at her foot distractedly, and at his foot
a peasant woman in black
is praying to the monument of the sailor praying
our lady of the shipwrecked is three times life size,
her lips sweet with divinity
she does not hear what the sailor or the peasant is saying ---
she is in love with the beautiful formlessness of the sea
gull-colored laces flap in the sea drafts
beside the postcard stalls
the peasants anchor them with conches one is told
these are the pretty trinkets the sea hides,
little shells made up into necklaces and toy ladies
they do not come from with bay of the dead down there,
but from another place, tropical and blue,
we have never been to
these are our crepes eat them before they blow cold
empty, i echo to the least footfall,
museum without statues, grand with pillars, porticoes, rotundas
in my courtyard a fountain leaps and sinks back into itself,
nun-hearted and blind to the world marble lilies
exhale their pallor like scent
i imagine myself with a great public,
mother of a white nike and several bald-eyed apollos
insread, the dead injure me attentions, and nothing can happen
blank-faced and mum as a nurse
a garden of mouthings purple, scarlet-speckled, black
the great corollas dilate, peeling back their silks
their musk encroaches, circle after circle,
a well of scents almost too dense to breathe in
hieratical in your frock coat, maestro of the bees,
you move among the many-breasted hives,
my heart under your foot, sister of a stone
trumpet-throats open to the beaks of birds
the golden rain tree drips its powders down
in these little boudoirs streaked with orange and red
the anthers nod their heads, potent as kings
to father dynasties the air is rich
here is a queenship no mother can contest ---
a fruit thats death to taste dark flesh, dark parings
in burrows narrow as a finger, solitary bees
keep house among the grasses kneeling down
i set my eyes to a hole-mouth and meet an eye
round, green, disconsolate as a tear
father, bridegroom, in this easter egg
under the coronal of sugar roses
the queen bee marries the winter of your year
will they occur,
these people with torso of steel
winged elbows and eyeholes
awaiting masses
of cloud to give them expression,
these super-people -
and my baby a nail
driven, driven in
he shrieks in his grease
bones nosing for distance
and i, nearly extinct,
his three teeth cutting
themselves on my thumb -
and the star,
the old story
in the lane i meet sheep and wagons,
red earth, motherly blood
o you who eat
people like light rays, leave
this one
mirror safe, unredeemed
by the doves annihilation,
the glory
the power, the glory
this wood burns a dark
incense pale moss drips
in elbow-scarves, beards
from the archaic
bones of the great trees
blue mists move over
a lake thick with fish
snails scroll the border
of the glazed water
with coils of rams-horn
out in the open
down there the late year
hammers her rare and
various metals
old pewter roots twist
up from the jet-backed
mirror of water
and while the airs clear
hourglass sifts a
drift of goldpieces
bright waterlights are
sliding their quoits one
after the other
down boles of the fir
in sunless air, under pines
green to the point of blackness, some
founding father set these lobed, warped stones
to loom in the leaf-filtered gloom
black as the charred knuckle-bones
of a giant or extinct
animal, come from another
age, another planet surely flanked
by the orange and fuchsia bonfire
of azaleas, sacrosanct
these stones guard a dark repose
and keep their shapes intact while sun
alters shadows of rose and iris ---
long, short, long --- in the lit garden
and kindles a days-end blaze
colored to dull the pigment
of azaleas, yet burnt out
quick as they to follow the lights tint
and intensity by midnight
by noon and throughout the brunt
of various weathers is
to know the still heart of the stones
stones that take the whole summer to lose
their dream of the winters cold stones
warming at core only as
frost forms no mans crowbar could
uproot them their beards are ever-
green nor do they, once in a hundred
years, go down to drink the river
no thirst disturbs a stones bed
mayday  two came to field in such wise
a daisied mead, each said to each,
so were they one so sought they couch,
across barbed stile, through flocked brown cows
no pitchforked farmer, please, she said
may cockcrow guard us safe, said he
by blackthorn thicket, flower spray
they pitched their coats, come to green bed
below  a fen where water stood
aslant  their hill of stinging nettle
then, honor-bound, mute grazing cattle
above  leaf-wraithed white air, white cloud
all afternoon these lovers lay
until the sun turned pale from warm,
until sweet wind changed tune, blew harm
cruel nettles stung her angles raw
rueful, most vexed, that tender skin
should accept so fell a wound,
he stamped and cracked stalks to the ground
which had caused his dear girl pain
now he goes from his rightful road
and, under honor, will depart
while she stands burning, venom-girt,
in wait for sharper smart to fade
nobody in the lane, and nothing, nothing but blackberries,
blackberries on either side, though on the right mainly,
a blackberry alley, going down in hooks, and a sea
somewhere at the end of it, heaving blackberries
big as the ball of my thumb, and dumb as eyes
ebon in the hedges, fat
with blue-red juices these they squander on my fingers
i had not asked for such a blood sisterhood they must love me
they accommodate themselves to my milkbottle, flattening their sides
overhead go the choughs in black, cacophonous flocks ---
bits of burnt paper wheeling in a blown sky
theirs is the only voice, protesting, protesting
i do not think the sea will appear at all
the high, green meadows are glowing, as if lit from within
i come to one bush of berries so ripe it is a bush of flies,
hanging their bluegreen bellies and their wing panes in a chinese screen
the honey-feast of the berries has stunned them they believe in heaven
one more hook, and the berries and bushes end
the only thing to come now is the sea
from between two hills a sudden wind funnels at me,
slapping its phantom laundry in my face
these hills are too green and sweet to have tasted salt
i follow the sheep path between them a last hook brings me
to the hills northern face, and the face is orange rock
that looks out on nothing, nothing but a great space
of white and pewter lights, and a din like silversmiths
beating and beating at an intractable metal
what is this, behind this veil, is it ugly, is it beautiful?
it is shimmering, has it breasts, has it edges?
i am sure it is unique, i am sure it is what i want
when i am quiet at my cooking i feel it looking, i feel it thinking
is this the one i am too appear for,
is this the elect one, the one with black eye-pits and a scar?
measuring the flour, cutting off the surplus,
adhering to rules, to rules, to rules
is this the one for the annunciation?
my god, what a laugh
but it shimmers, it does not stop, and i think it wants me
i would not mind if it were bones, or a pearl button
i do not want much of a present, anyway, this year
after all i am alive only by accident
i would have killed myself gladly that time any possible way
now there are these veils, shimmering like curtains,
the diaphanous satins of a january window
white as babies bedding and glittering with dead breath o ivory
it must be a tusk there, a ghost column
can you not see i do not mind what it is
can you not give it to me?
do not be ashamed--i do not mind if it is small
do not be mean, i am ready for enormity
let us sit down to it, one on either side, admiring the gleam,
the glaze, the mirrory variety of it
let us eat our last supper at it, like a hospital plate
i know why you will not give it to me,
you are terrified
the world will go up in a shriek, and your head with it,
bossed, brazen, an antique shield,
a marvel to your great-grandchildren
do not be afraid, it is not so
i will only take it and go aside quietly
you will not even hear me opening it, no paper crackle,
no falling ribbons, no scream at the end
i do not think you credit me with this discretion
if you only knew how the veils were killing my days
to you they are only transparencies, clear air
but my god, the clouds are like cotton
armies of them they are carbon monoxide
sweetly, sweetly i breathe in,
filling my veins with invisibles, with the million
probable motes that tick the years off my life
you are silver-suited for the occasion o adding machine-----
is it impossible for you to let something go and have it go whole?
must you stamp each piece purple,
must you kill what you can?
there is one thing i want today, and only you can give it to me
it stands at my window, big as the sky
it breathes from my sheets, the cold dead center
where split lives congeal and stiffen to history
let it not come by the mail, finger by finger
let it not come by word of mouth, i should be sixty
by the time the whole of it was delivered, and to numb to use it
only let down the veil, the veil, the veil
if it were death
i would admire the deep gravity of it, its timeless eyes
i would know you were serious
there would be a nobility then, there would be a birthday
and the knife not carve, but enter
pure and clean as the cry of a baby,
and the universe slide from my side
on the stiff twig up there
hunches a wet black rook
arranging and rearranging its feathers in the rain
i do not expect a miracle
or an accident
to set the sight on fire
in my eye, not seek
any more in the desultory weather some design,
but let spotted leaves fall as they fall,
without ceremony, or portent
although, i admit, i desire,
occasionally, some backtalk
from the mute sky, i cant honestly complain
a certain minor light may still
leap incandescent
out of the kitchen table or chair
as if a celestial burning took
possession of the most obtuse objects now and then ---
thus hallowing an interval
otherwise inconsequent
by bestowing largesse, honor,
one might say love at any rate, i now walk
wary for it could happen
even in this dull, ruinous landscape sceptical,
yet politic ignorant
of whatever angel may choose to flare
suddenly at my elbow i only know that a rook
ordering its black feathers can so shine
as to seize my senses, haul
my eyelids up, and grant
a brief respite from fear
of total neutrality with luck,
trekking stubborn through this season
of fatigue, i shall
patch together a content
of sorts miracles occur,
if you care to call those spasmodic
tricks of radiance miracles the waits begun again,
the long wait for the angel
for that rare, random descent
the black bull bellowed before the sea
the sea, till that day orderly,
hove up against bendylaw
the queen in the mulberry arbor stared
stiff as a queen on a playing card
the king fingered his beard
a blue sea, four horny bull-feet,
a bull-snouted sea that wouldnt stay put,
bucked at the garden gate
along box-lined walks in the florid sun
toward the rowdy bellow and back again
the lords and ladies ran
the great bronze gate began to crack,
the sea broke in at every crack,
pellmell, blueblack
the bull surged up, the bull surged down,
not to be stayed by a daisy chain
nor by any learned man
o the kings tidy acre is under the sea,
and the royal rose in the bulls belly,
and the bull on the kings highway
two, of course there are two
it seems perfectly natural now ---
the one who never looks up, whose eyes are lidded
and balled? like blakes
who exhibits
the birthmarks that are his trademark ---
the scald scar of water,
the nude
verdigris of the condor
i am red meat his beak
claps sidewise i am not his yet
he tells me how badly i photograph
he tells me how sweet
the babies look in their hospital
icebox, a simple
frill at the neck
then the flutings of their ionian
death-gowns
then two little feet
he does not smile or smoke
the other does that
his hair long and plausive
bastard
masturbating a glitter
he wants to be loved
i do not stir
the frost makes a flower,
the dew makes a star,
the dead bell,
the dead bell
somebodys done for
two virtues ride, by stallion, by nag,
to grind our knives and scissors
lantern-jawed reason, squat common sense,
one courting doctors of all sorts,
one, housewives and shopkeepers
the trees are lopped, the poodles trim,
the laborers nails pared level
since those two civil servants set
their whetstone to the blunted edge
and minced the muddling devil
whose owl-eyes in the scraggly wood
scared mothers to miscarry,
drove the dogs to cringe and whine
and turned the farmboys temper wolfish,
the housewifes, desultory
in the rectory garden on his evening walk
paced brisk father shawn a cold day, a sodden one it was
in black novemeber after a sliding rain
dew stood in chill sweat on each stalk,
each thorn spiring from wet earth, a blue haze
hung caught in dark-webbed branches like a fabulous heron
hauled sudden from solitude,
hair prickling on his head,
father shawn perceived a ghost
shaping itself from that mist
how now, father shawn crisply addressed the ghost
wavering there, gauze-edged, smelling of woodsmoke,
what manner of business are you on?
from your blue pallor, id say you inhabited the frozen waste
of hell, and not the fiery part yet to judge by that dazzled look,
that noble mien, perhaps youve late quitted heaven?
in voice furred with frost,
ghost said to priest
neither of those countries do i frequent
earth is my haunt
come, come, father shawn gave an impatient shrug,
i dont ask you to spin some rridiculous fable
of gilded harps or gnawing fire simply tell
after your lifes end, what just epilogue
god ordained to follow up your days is it such trouble
to satisfy the questions of a curious old fool?
in life, love gnawed my skin
to this white bone
what love did then, love does now
gnaws me through
what love, asked father shawn, but too great love
of flawed earth-flesh could cause this sorry pass?
some damned condition you are in
thinking never to have left the world, you grieve
as though alive, shriveling in torment thus
to atone as shade for sin that lured blind man
the day of doom
is not yest come
until that time
a crock of dust is my dear hom
fond phantom, cried shocked father shawn,
can there be such stubbornness--
a soul grown feverish, clutching its dead body-tree
like a last storm-crossed leaf? best get you gone
to judgment in a higher court of grace
repent, depart, before gods trump-crack splits the sky
from that pale mist
ghost swore to priest
there sits no higher court
than mans red heart
the womb
rattles its pod, the moon
discharges itself from the tree with nowhere to go
my landscape is a hand with no lines,
the roads bunched to a knot,
the knot myself,
myself the rose you acheive---
this body,
this ivory
ungodly as a childs shriek
spiderlike, i spin mirrors,
loyal to my image,
uttering nothing but blood---
taste it, dark red
and my forest
my funeral,
and this hill and this
gleaming with the mouths of corpses
an old beast ended in this place
a monster of wood and rusty teeth
fire smelted his eyes to lumps
of pale blue vitreous stuff, opaque
as resin drops oozed from pine bark
the rafters and struts of his body wear
their char of karakul still i cant tell
how long his carcass had foundered under
the rubbish of summers, the black-leaved falls
now little weeds insinuate
soft suede tongues between his bones
his armorplate, his toppled stones
are an esplanade for crickets
i pick and pry like a doctor or
arch?ologist among
iron entrails, enameled bowl,
the coils and pipes that made him run
the small dell eats what ate it once
and yet the ichor of the spring
proceeds clear as it ever did
from the broken throat, that marshy lip
it flows off below the green and white
balustrade of a sag-backed bridge
leaning over, i encounter one
blue and improbable person
framed in a basketwork of cattails
o she is gracious and austere,
seated beneath the toneless water
it is not i, it is not i
no animal spoils on her green doorstep
and we shall never enter there
where the durable ones keep house
the stream that hustles us
neither nourishes nor heals
revolving in oval loops of solar speed,
couched in cauls of clay as in holy robes,
dead men render love and war no heed,
lulled in the ample womb of the full-tilt globe
no spiritual caesars are these dead
they want no proud paternal kingdom come
and when at last they blunder into bed
world-wrecked, they seek only oblivion
rolled round with goodly loam and cradled deep,
these bone shanks will not wake immaculate
to trumpet-toppling dawn of doomstruck day
they loll forever in colossal sleep
nor can gods stern, shocked angels cry them up
from their fond, final, infamous decay
gerd sits spindle-shaped in her dark tent,
lean face gone tawn with seasons ,
skin worn down to the knucklebones
at her tough trade without times taint
the burnished ball hangs fire in her hands, a lens
fusing times three horizons
two enter to tap her sight, a green pair
fresh leaved out in vows come tell
how we shall do together,
well or ill gerd slants a look at each most dear,
each to the other fit fiber for stern weather
slowly she spins the ball
i see two stalwart apple trees
coupled by branches intertwined
and, springing all about,
staunch saplings to this house, thriving days
will bring crops increase, and harvest fruit
follow on kind wind
no hardship then? he asks well take
whatever trials to come, so say true
his bride echoes his word at that,
gerd whirls the ball ablaze rough storm, she grunts,  may wreak
some havoc on tender limb, and yet
strengthen that orchard thereby
their small price paid, these wedded ones
walk forth into sun-moneyed air, quickened
to savor their span of flourishing
aloof, squatting mummy-wise, gerd scans
that clairvoyant quartz which once, at her own wishing,
exacted her first simple sight for this strict second
then, a free-gadding hoyden, gerd had craved
to govern more sight than given to a woman
by wits alone to foresee her lovers faith
and their future lot, she braved
church curse to ken that crooked oath
whereby one hires a demon
a flash like doomcrack rent nights black
gods work stood anchored in that glare
focusing all times day-suns in one
so beggar gerd might aim her look
at gorgon-prospects with power to strike to stone
hearts of those who pierced times core
what gerd saw then engraved her mind ---
plague-pitted as the moon each bud
shriveling to cinders at its source,
each love blazing blind to its gutted end ---
and, fixed in the crystal center, grinning fierce
earths ever-green deaths head
the telegram says you have gone away
and left our bankrupt circus on its town
there is nothing more for me to say
the maestro gives the singing birds their pay
and they buy tickets for the tropic zone
the telegram says you have gone away
the clever wolly dogs have had their day
they shoot the dice for one remaining bone
there is nothing more for me to say
the lion and the tigers turn to clay
and jumbo sadly trumpets into stone
the telegram says you have gone away
the morbid cobras wits have run astray
he rents his poisons out by telegram
there is nothing more for me to say
the colored tenst all topple in the bay
the magic sawdust writes address unknown
the telegram says you have gone away
there is nothing more for me to say
i made a fire being tired
of the white fists of old
letters and their death rattle
when i came too close to the wastebasket
what did they know that i didnt?
grain by grain, they unrolled
sands where a dream of clear water
grinned like a getaway car
i am not subtle
love, love, and well, i was tired
of cardboard cartons the color of cement or a dog pack
holding in its hate
dully, under a pack of men in red jackets,
and the eyes and times of the postmarks
this fire may lick and fawn, but it is merciless
a glass case
my fingers would enter although
they melt and sag, they are told
do not touch
and here is an end to the writing,
the spry hooks that bend and cringe and the smiles, the smiles
and at least it will be a good place now, the attic
at least i wont be strung just under the surface,
dumb fish
with one tin eye,
watching for glints,
riding my arctic
between this wish and that wish
so, i poke at the carbon birds in my housedress
they are more beautiful than my bodiless owl,
they console me--
rising and flying, but blinded
they would flutter off, black and glittering, they would be coal angels
only they have nothing to say but anybody
i have seen to that
with the butt of a rake
i flake up papers that breathe like people,
i fan them out
between the yellow lettuces and the german cabbage
involved in its weird blue dreams
involved in a foetus
and a name with black edges
wilts at my foot,
sinuous orchis
in a nest of root-hairs and boredom--
pale eyes, patent-leather gutturals
warm rain greases my hair, extinguishes nothing
my veins glow like trees
the dogs are tearing a fox this is what it is like
a read burst and a cry
that splits from its ripped bag and does not stop
with that dead eye
and the stuffed expression, but goes on
dyeing the air,
telling the particles of the clouds, the leaves, the water
what immortality is that it is immortal
tell me what you see in it
the pine tree like a rorschach-blot
black against the orange light
plant an orange pumpkin patch
which at twelve will quaintly hatch
nine black mice with ebon coach,
or walk into the orange and make
a devils cataract of black
obscure gods eye with corkscrew fleck
put orange mistress half in sun,
half in shade, until her skin
tattoos black leaves on tangerine
read black magic or holy book
or lyric of love in the orange and black
till dark is conquered by orange cock,
but more pragmatic than all this,
say how crafty the painter was
to make orange and black ambiguous
it is ten years, now, since we rowed to childrens island
the sun flamed straight down that noon on the water off marblehead
that summer we wore black glasses to hide our eyes
we were always crying, in our spare rooms, little put-upon sisters,
in the two, huge, white, handsome houses in swampscott
when the sweetheart from england appeared, with her cream skin and yardley cosmetics,
i had to sleep in the same room with the baby on a too-short cot,
and the seven-year-old wouldnt go out unless his jersey stripes
matched the stripes of his socks
or it was richness --- eleven rooms and a yacht
with a polished mahogany stair to let into the water
and a cabin boy who could decorate cakes in six-colored frosting
but i didnt know how to cook, and babies depressed me
nights, i wrote in my diary spitefully, my fingers red
with triangular scorch marks from ironing tiny ruchings and puffed sleeves
when the sporty wife and her doctor husband went on one of their cruises
they left me a borrowed maid named ellen, for protection,
and a small dalmation
in your house, the main house, you were better off
you had a rose garden and a guest cottage and a model apothecary shop
and a cook and a maid, and knew about the key to the bourbon
i remember you playing ja-da in a pink piqu dress
on the game-room piano, when the big people were out,
and the maid smoked and shot pool under a green shaded lamp
the cook had one walleye and couldnt sleep, she was so nervous
on trial, from ireland, she burned batch after batch of cookies
till she was fired
o what has come over us, my sister
on that day-off the two of us cried so hard to get
we lifted a sugared ham and a pineapple from the grownups icebox
and rented an old green boat i rowed you read
aloud, cross-legged on the stern seat, from the generation of vipers
so we bobbed out to the island it was deserted ---
a gallery of creaking porches and still interiors,
stopped and awful as a photograph of somebody laughing
but ten years dead
the bold gulls dove as if they owned it all
we picked up sticks of driftwood and beat them off,
then stepped down the steep beach shelf and into the water
we kicked and talked the thick salt kept us up
i see us floating there yet, inseparable--two cork dolls
what keyhole have we slipped through, what door has shut?
the shadows of the grasses inched round like hands of a clock,
and from our opposite continents we wave and call
everything has happened
in alicante they bowl the barrels
bumblingly over the nubs of the cobbles
past the yellow-paella eateries,
below the ramshackle back-alley balconies,
while the cocks and hens
in the roofgardens
scuttle repose with crowns and cackles
kumquat-colored trolleys ding as they trundle
passengers under an indigo fizzle
needling spumily down from the wires
alongside the sibliant narhor the lovers
hear loudspeakers boom
from each neon-lit palm
rumbas and sambas no ear-flaps can muffle
o cacophony, goddess of jazz and of quarrels,
crack-throated mistress of bagpipes and cymbals,
let be your con brios, your capricciosos,
crescendos, cadenzas, prestos and pretissimos,
my head on the pillow
piano, pianissimo
lullayed by susurrous lyres and viols
in the archological museum in cambridge is a stone
coffin of the fourth century ad containing the skeletons
of a woman, a mouse and a shrew the ankle-bone of the
woman has been slightly gnawed
rigged poker -stiff on her back
with a granite grin
this antique museum-cased lady
lies, companioned by the gimcrack
relics of a mouse and a shrew
that battened for a day on her ankle-bone
these three, unmasked now, bear
dry witness
to the gross eating game
wed wink at if we didnt hear
stars grinding, crumb by crumb,
our own grist down to its bony face
how they grip us through think and thick,
these barnacle dead
this lady heres no kin
of mine, yet kin she is shell suck
blood and whistle my narrow clean
to prove it as i think now of her hand,
from the mercury-backed glass
mother, grandmother, greatgrandmother
reach hag hands to haul me in,
and an image looms under the fishpond surface
where the daft father went down
with orange duck-feet winnowing this hair ---
all the long gone darlings they
get back, though, soon,
soon be it by wakes, weddings,
childbirths or a family barbecue
any touch, taste, tangs
fit for those outlaws to ride home on,
and to sanctuary usurping the armchair
between tick
and tack of the clock, until we go,
each skulled-and-crossboned gulliver
riddled with ghosts, to lie
deadlocked with them, taking roots as cradles rock
first, are you our sort of a person?
do you wear
a glass eye, false teeth or a crutch,
a brace or a hook,
rubber breasts or a rubber crotch,
stitches to show somethings missing? no, no? then
how can we give you a thing?
stop crying
open your hand
empty? empty here is a hand
to fill it and willing
to bring teacups and roll away headaches
and do whatever you tell it
will you marry it?
it is guaranteed
to thumb shut your eyes at the end
and dissolve of sorrow
we make new stock from the salt
i notice you are stark naked
how about this suit -
black and stiff, but not a bad fit
will you marry it?
it is waterproof, shatterproof, proof
against fire and bombs through the roof
believe me, theyll bury you in it
now your head, excuse me, is empty
i have the ticket for that
come here, sweetie, out of the closet
well, what do you think of that?
naked as paper to start
but in twenty-five years shell be silver,
in fifty, gold
a living doll, everywhere you look
it can sew, it can cook,
it can talk, talk, talk
it works, there is nothing wrong with it
you have a hole, its a poultice
you have an eye, its an image
my boy, its your last resort
will you marry it, marry it, marry it
i ordered this, clean wood box
square as a chair and almost too heavy to lift
i would say it was the coffin of a midget
or a square baby
were there not such a din in it
the box is locked, it is dangerous
i have to live with it overnight
and i cant keep away from it
there are no windows, so i cant see what is in there
there is only a little grid, no exit
i put my eye to the grid
it is dark, dark,
with the swarmy feeling of african hands
minute and shrunk for export,
black on black, angrily clambering
how can i let them out?
it is the noise that appalls me most of all,
the unintelligible syllables
it is like a roman mob,
small, taken one by one, but my god, together
i lay my ear to furious latin
i am not a caesar
i have simply ordered a box of maniacs
they can be sent back
they can die, i need feed them nothing, i am the owner
i wonder how hungry they are
i wonder if they would forget me
if i just undid the locks and stood back and turned into a tree
there is the laburnum, its blond colonnades,
and the petticoats of the cherry
they might ignore me immediately
in my moon suit and funeral veil
i am no source of honey
so why should they turn on me?
tomorrow i will be sweet god, i will set them free
the box is only temporary
all morning in the strawberry field
they talked about the russians
squatted down between the rows
we listened
we heard the head woman say,
bomb them off the map
horseflies buzzed, paused and stung
and the taste of strawberries
turned thick and sour
mary said slowly, ive got a fella
old enough to go
if anything should happen
the sky was high and blue
two children laughed at tag
in the tall grass,
leaping awkward and long-legged
across the rutted road
the fields were full of bronzed young men
hoeing lettuce, weeding celery
the draft is passed, the woman said
we ought to have bombed them long ago
dont, pleaded the little girl
with blond braids
her blue eyes swam with vague terror
she added petishly, i cant see why
youre always talking this way
oh, stop worrying, nelda,
snapped the woman sharply
she stood up, a thin commanding figure
in faded dungarees
businesslike she asked us, how many quarts?
she recorded the total in her notebook,
and we all turned back to picking
kneeling over the rows,
we reached among the leaves
with quick practiced hands,
cupping the berry protectively before
snapping off the stem
between thumb and forefinger
they are the last romantics, these candles
upside-down hearts of light tipping wax fingers,
and the fingers, taken in by their own haloes,
grown milky, almost clear, like the bodies of saints
it is touching, the way theyll ignore
a whole family of prominent objects
simply to plumb the deeps of an eye
in its hollow of shadows, its fringe of reeds,
and the owner past thirty, no beauty at all
daylight would be more judicious,
giving everybody a fair hearing
they should have gone out with the balloon flights and the stereopticon
this is no time for the private point of view
when i light them, my nostrils prickle
their pale, tentative yellows
drag up false, edwardian sentiments,
and i remember my maternal grandmother from vienna
as a schoolgirl she gave roses to franz josef
the burghers sweated and wept the children wore white
and my grandfather moped in the tyrol,
imagining himself a headwaiter in america,
floating in a high-church hush
among ice buckets, frosty napkins
these little globes of light are sweet as pears
kindly with invalids and mawkish women,
they mollify the bald moon
nun-souled, they burn heavenward and never marry
the eyes of the child i nurse are scarcely open
in twenty years i shall be retrograde
as these drafty ephemerids
i watch their spilt tears cloud and dull to pearls
how shall i tell anything at all
to this infant still in a birth-drowse?
tonight, like a shawl, the mild light enfolds her,
the shadows stoop over the guests at a christening
ou do not do, you do not do
any more, black shoe
in which i have lived like a foot
for thirty years, poor and white,
barely daring to breathe or achoo
daddy, i have had to kill you
you died before i had time--
marble-heavy, a bag full of god,
ghastly statue with one gray toe
big as a frisco seal
and a head in the freakish atlantic
where it pours bean green over blue
in the waters off beautiful nauset
i used to pray to recover you
ach, du
in the german tongue, in the polish town
scraped flat by the roller
of wars, wars, wars
but the name of the town is common
my polack friend
says there are a dozen or two
so i never could tell where you
put your foot, your root,
i never could talk to you
the tongue stuck in my jaw
it stuck in a barb wire snare
ich, ich, ich, ich,
i could hardly speak
i thought every german was you
and the language obscene
an engine, an engine
chuffing me off like a jew
a jew to dachau, auschwitz, belsen
i began to talk like a jew
i think i may well be a jew
the snows of the tyrol, the clear beer of vienna
are not very pure or true
with my gipsy ancestress and my weird luck
and my taroc pack and my taroc pack
i may be a bit of a jew
i have always been scared of you,
with your luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo
and your neat mustache
and your aryan eye, bright blue
panzer-man, panzer-man, o you--
not god but a swastika
so black no sky could squeak through
every woman adores a fascist,
the boot in the face, the brute
brute heart of a brute like you
you stand at the blackboard, daddy,
in the picture i have of you,
a cleft in your chin instead of your foot
but no less a devil for that, no not
any less the black man who
bit my pretty red heart in two
i was ten when they buried you
at twenty i tried to die
and get back, back, back to you
i thought even the bones would do
but they pulled me out of the sack,
and they stuck me together with glue
and then i knew what to do
i made a model of you,
a man in black with a meinkampf look
and a love of the rack and the screw
and i said i do, i do
so daddy, im finally through
the black telephones off at the root,
the voices just cant worm through
if ive killed one man, ive killed two--
the vampire who said he was you
and drank my blood for a year,
seven years, if you want to know
daddy, you can lie back now
theres a stake in your fat black heart
and the villagers never liked you
they are dancing and stamping on you
they always knew it was you
daddy, daddy, you bastard, im through
i know the bottom, she says i know it with my great tap root
it is what you fear
i do not fear it i have been there
is it the sea you hear in me,
its dissatisfactions?
or the voice of nothing, that was your madness?
love is a shadow
how you lie and cry after it
listen these are its hooves it has gone off, like a horse
all night i shall gallop thus, impetuously,
till your head is a stone, your pillow a little turf,
echoing, echoing
or shall i bring you the sound of poisons?
this is rain now, this big hush
and this is the fruit of it tin-white, like arsenic
i have suffered the atrocity of sunsets
scorched to the root
my red filaments burn and stand, a hand of wires
now i break up in pieces that fly about like clubs
a wind of such violence
will tolerate no bystanding i must shriek
the moon, also, is merciless she would drag me
cruelly, being barren
her radiance scathes me or perhaps i have caught her
i let her go i let her go
diminished and flat, as after radical surgery
how your bad dreams possess and endow me
i am inhabited by a cry
nightly it flaps out
looking, with its hooks, for something to love
i am terrified by this dark thing
that sleeps in me
all day i feel its soft, feathery turnings, its malignity
clouds pass and disperse
are those the faces of love, those pale irretrievables?
is it for such i agitate my heart?
i am incapable of more knowledge
what is this, this face
so murderous in its strangle of branches? -
its snaky acids hiss
it petrifies the will these are the isolate, slow faults
that kill, that kill, that kill
over your body the clouds go
high, high and icily
and a little flat, as if they
unlike swans,
having no reflections
unlike you,
with no strings attached
all cool, all blue unlike you ---
you, there on your back,
eyes to the sky
the spider-men have caught you,
winding and twining their petty fetters,
their bribes ---
so many silks
how they hate you
they converse in the valley of your fingers, they are inchworms
they would have you sleep in their cabinets,
this tow and that toe, a relic
step off
step off seven leagues, like those distances
that revolve in crivelli, untouchable
let this eye be an eagle,
the shadow of his lip, an abyss
the groundhog on the mountain did not run
but fatly scuttled into the splayed fern
and faced me, back to a ledge of dirt, to rattle
her sallow rodent teeth like castanets
against my leaning down, would not exchange
for that wary clatter sound or gesture
of love  claws braced, at bay, my currency not hers
such meetings never occur in marchen
where love-met groundhogs love one in return,
where straight talk is the rule, whether warm or hostile,
which no gruff animal misinterprets
from what grace am i fallen tongues are strange,
signs say nothing the falcon who spoke clear
to canacee cries gibberish to coarsened ears
irrefutable, beautifully smug
as venus, pedestalled on a half-shell
shawled in blond hair and the salt
scrim of a sea breeze, the women
settle in their belling dresses
over each weighty stomach a face
floats calm as a moon or a cloud
smiling to themselves, they meditate
devoutly as the dutch bulb
forming its twenty petals
the dark still nurses its secret
on the green hill, under the thorn trees,
they listen for the millennium,
the knock of the small, new heart
pink-buttoned infants attend them
looping wool, doing nothing in particular,
they step among the archetypes
dusk hoods them in mary-blue
while far off, the axle of winter
grinds round, bearing down the straw,
the star, the wise grey men
old goatherds swear how all night long they hear
the warning whirr and burring of the bird
who wakes with darkness and till dawn works hard
vampiring dry of milk each great goat udder
moon full, moon dark, the chary dairy farmer
dreams that his fattest cattle dwindle, fevered
by claw-cuts of the goatsucker, alias devil-bird,
its eye, flashlit, a chip of ruby fire
so fables say the goatsucker moves, masked from mens sight
in an ebony air, on wings of witch cloth,
well-named, ill-famed a knavish fly-by-night,
yet it never milked any goat, nor dealt cow death
and shadows only--cave-mouth bristle beset--
cockchafers and the wan, green luna moth
pure? what does it mean?
the tongues of hell
are dull, dull as the triple
tongues of dull, fat cerebus
who wheezes at the gate incapable
of licking clean
the aguey tendon, the sin, the sin
the tinder cries
the indelible smell
of a snuffed candle
love, love, the low smokes roll
from me like isadoras scarves, im in a fright
one scarf will catch and anchor in the wheel
such yellow sullen smokes
make their own element they will not rise,
but trundle round the globe
choking the aged and the meek,
the weak
hothouse baby in its crib,
the ghastly orchid
hanging its hanging garden in the air,
devilish leopard
radiation turned it white
and killed it in an hour
greasing the bodies of adulterers
like hiroshima ash and eating in
the sin the sin
darling, all night
i have been flickering, off, on, off, on
the sheets grow heavy as a lechers kiss
three days three nights
lemon water, chicken
water, water make me retch
i am too pure for you or anyone
your body
hurts me as the world hurts god i am a lantern ---
my head a moon
of japanese paper, my gold beaten skin
infinitely delicate and infinitely expensive
does not my heat astound you and my light
all by myself i am a huge camellia
glowing and coming and going, flush on flush
i think i am going up,
i think i may rise ---
the beads of hot metal fly, and i, love, i
am a pure acetylene
virgin
attended by roses,
by kisses, by cherubim,
by whatever these pink things mean
not you, nor him
not him, nor him
my selves dissolving, old whore petticoats ---
to paradise
enter the chilly no-mans land of about
five oclock in the morning, the no-color void
where the waking head rubbishes out the draggled lot
of sulfurous dreamscapes and obscure lunar conundrums
which seemed, when dreamed, to mean so profoundly much,
gets ready to face the ready-made creation
of chairs and bureaus and sleep-twisted sheets
this is the kingdom of the fading apparition,
the oracular ghost who dwindles on pin-legs
to a knot of laundry, with a classic bunch of sheets
upraised, as a hand, emblematic of farewell
at this joint between two worlds and two entirely
incompatible modes of time, the raw material
of our meat-and-potato thoughts assumes the nimbus
of ambrosial revelation and so departs
chair and bureau are the hieroglyphs
of some godly utterance wakened heads ignore
so these posed sheets, before they thin to nothing,
speak in sign language of a lost otherworld,
a world we lose by merely waking up
trailing its telltale tatters only at the outermost
fringe of mundane vision, this ghost goes
hand aloft, goodbye, goodbye, not down
into the rocky gizzard of the earth,
but toward a region where our thick atmosphere
diminishes, and god knows what is there
a point of exclamation marks that sky
in ringing orange like a stellar carrot
its round period, displaced and green,
suspends beside it the first point, the starting
point of eden, next the new moons curve
go, ghost of our mother and father, ghost of us,
and ghost of our dreams children, in those sheets
which signify our origin and end,
to the cloud-cuckoo land of color wheels
and pristine alphabets and cows that moo
and moo as they jump over moons as new
as that crisp cusp toward which you voyage now
hail and farewell hello, goodbye o keeper
of the profane grail, the dreaming skull
et us go then, you and ,
hen the evening is spread out against the sky
ike a patient etherized upon a table
et us go, through certain half-deserted streets,
he muttering retreats
f restless nights in one-night cheap hotels
nd sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells
treets that follow like a tedious argument
f insidious intent
o lead you to an overwhelming question 
h, do not ask, hat is it?
et us go and make our visit
n the room the women come and go
alking of ichelangelo
he yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,
he yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,
icked its tongue into the corners of the evening,
ingered upon the pools that stand in drains,
et fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,
lipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,
nd seeing that it was a soft ctober night,
urled once about the house, and fell asleep
nd indeed there will be time
or the yellow smoke that slides along the street,
ubbing its back upon the window-panes
here will be time, there will be time
o prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet
here will be time to murder and create,
nd time for all the works and days of hands
hat lift and drop a question on your plate
ime for you and time for me,
nd time yet for a hundred indecisions,
nd for a hundred visions and revisions,
efore the taking of a toast and tea
n the room the women come and go
alking of ichelangelo
nd indeed there will be time
o wonder, o  dare? and, o  dare?
ime to turn back and descend the stair,
ith a bald spot in the middle of my hair--
hey will say ow his hair is growing thin

y necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin--
hey will say ut how his arms and legs are thin
o  dare
isturb the universe?
n a minute there is time
or decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse
or  have known them all already, known them all
ave known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,
 have measured out my life with coffee spoons

eneath the music from a farther room
o how should  presume?
nd  have known the eyes already, known them all--
he eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,
nd when  am formulated, sprawling on a pin,
hen  am pinned and wriggling on the wall,
hen how should  begin
o spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?
nd how should  presume?
nd  have known the arms already, known them all--
rms that are braceleted and white and bare
ut in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair
s it perfume from a dress
hat makes me so digress?
rms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl
nd should  then presume?
nd how should  begin?
hall  say,  have gone at dusk through narrow streets
nd watched the smoke that rises from the pipes
f lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows? 
 should have been a pair of ragged claws
cuttling across the floors of silent seas
  
nd the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully
moothed by long fingers,
sleep  tired  or it malingers,
tretched on the floor, here beside you and me
hould , after tea and cakes and ices,
ave the strength to force the moment to its crisis?
ut though  have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,
hough  have seen my head grown slightly bald brought in upon a platter,
 am no prophet--and heres no great matter
 have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,
nd  have seen the eternal ootman hold my coat, and snicker,
nd in short,  was afraid
nd would it have been worth it, after all,
fter the cups, the marmalade, the tea,
mong the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,
ould it have been worth while,
o have bitten off the matter with a smile,
o have squeezed the universe into a ball
o roll it towards some overwhelming question,
o say  am azarus, come from the dead,
ome back to tell you all,  shall tell you all--
f one, settling a pillow by her head
hould say hat is not what  meant at all
hat is not it, at all
nd would it have been worth it, after all,
ould it have been worth while,
fter the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,
fter the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor--
nd this, and so much more?--
t is impossible to say just what  mean
ut as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen
ould it have been worth while
f one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,
nd turning toward the window, should say
hat is not it at all,
hat is not what  meant, at all
o  am not rince amlet, nor was meant to be
m an attendant lord, one that will do
o swell a progress, start a scene or two,
dvise the prince no doubt, an easy tool,
eferential, glad to be of use,
olitic, cautious, and meticulous

t times, indeed, almost ridiculous--

 shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled
hall  part my hair behind? o  dare to eat a peach?

he rope of the gibbet hangs heavily, the bullets of princes are flying,
the creatures of power laugh aloud,
nd all these things bear fruits--and they are good
hose corpses of young men,
hose martyrs that hang from the gibbets--those hearts pierced by the grey
lead,

hey were purified by death--they were taught and exalted

turn to bear seed,

ot a disembodied spirit can the weapons of tyrants let loose,

hat is nothing that is quelled by one or two failures, or any number of
failures,
r by the indifference or ingratitude of the people, or by any
unfaithfulness,
r the show of the tushes of power, soldiers, cannon, penal statutes
hat we believe in waits latent for ever through all the continents, and
all the islands and archipelagoes of the sea
hat we believe in invites no one, promises nothing, sits in calmness and
light, is positive and composed, knows no discouragement,
aiting patiently, waiting its time
he battle rages with many a loud alarm, and frequent advance and retreat,
he infidel triumphs--or supposes he triumphs,
he prison, scaffold, garrote, handcuffs, iron necklace and anklet, lead-
balls, do their work,
he named and unnamed heroes pass to other spheres,
he great speakers and writers are exiled--they lie sick in distant lands,
he cause is asleep--the strongest throats are still, choked
with their own blood,
he young men drop their eyelashes toward the ground when they meet
ut, for all this, iberty has not gone out of the place, nor the infidel
entered into possession
hen iberty goes out of a place, it is not the first to go, nor the second
or third to go,
t waits for all the rest to go--it is the last
hen there are no more memories of heroes and martyrs,

what anything is for,

great,

turbulent city,
leepless, amid her ships, her houses, her incalculable wealth,

t dead of night, at news from the outh,
ncensed, struck with clenched hand the pavement
 shock electric--the night sustained it

rom the houses then, and the workshops, and through all the doorways,

he driver deserting his waggon in the street, jumping down, throwing the
reins abruptly down on the horses backs
he salesman leaving the store--the boss, book-keeper, porter, all leaving
quads gathering everywhere by common consent, and arming

accoutrements--they buckle the straps carefully
utdoors arming--indoors arming--the flash of the musket-barrels
he white tents cluster in camps--the armed sentries around--the sunrise
cannon, and again at sunset
rmed regiments arrive every day, pass through the city, and embark from
the wharves
ow good they look, as they tramp down to the river, sweaty, with their
guns on their shoulders

dauntlessness,

ot the immense wind which strengthens--not the wind which lashes
ot the spirit that ever lashes its own body to terror and death

look down as from a height

wealth incalculable

locomotives

watching me

far away
 solemn and slow procession there as  sit on the ground,

ehind, the terraced sides of a mountain, abrupt in places, rising high
roken with rocks, with clinging cedars, with tall shapes, dingily seen
he numerous camp-fires scattered near and far, some away up on the
mountain
he shadowy forms of men and horses, looming, large-sized, flickering

eternal stars

ne look  but gave, which your dear eyes returned with a look  shall
never forget
ne touch of your hand to mine,  boy, reached up as you lay on the ground
hen onward  sped in the battle, the even-contested battle
ill, late in the night relieved, to the place at last again  made my way
ound you in death so cold, dear comrade--found your body, son of
responding kisses, never again on earth responding
ared your face in the starlight--curious the scene--cool blew the moderate
night-wind
ong there and then in vigil  stood, dimly around me the battlefield
spreading
igil wondrous and vigil sweet, there in the fragrant silent night
ut not a tear fell, not even a long-drawn sigh--ong, long  gazed
hen on the earth partially reclining, sat by your side, leaning my chin in
my hands
assing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours, with you, dearest comrade--
ot a tear, not a word
igil of silence, love, and death--vigil for you, my son and my soldier,
s onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones upward stole
igil final for you, brave boy,  could not save you, swift was your
death,
 faithfully loved you and cared for you living-- think we shall surely
meet again
ill at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the dawn appeared,
y comrade  wrapped in his blanket, enveloped well his form,
olded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head, and carefully
under feet
nd there and then, and bathed by the rising sun, my son in his grave, in
his rude-dug grave,  deposited
nding my vigil strange with that--vigil of night and battlefield dim
igil for boy of responding kisses, never again on earth responding
igil for comrade swiftly slain, vigil  never forget--how as day
brightened
 rose from the chill ground, and folded my soldier well in his blanket,
nd buried him where he fell
 
athed in wars perfume--delicate flag
 to hear you call the sailors and the soldiers flag like a beautiful
woman
 to hear the tramp, tramp, of a million answering men  the ships they
arm with joy
 to see you leap and beckon from the tall masts of ships
 to see you peering down on the sailors on the decks
lag like the eyes of women

nd by one great pitchy torch, stationary, with wild red flame, and clouds
of smoke
y these, crowds, groups of forms, vaguely  see, on the floor, some in the
pews laid down
t my feet more distinctly, a soldier, a mere lad, in danger of bleeding to
death, he is shot in the abdomen
 staunch the blood temporarily, the youngsters face is white as a lily
hen before  depart  sweep my eyes oer the scene, fain to absorb it all
aces, varieties, postures, beyond description, most in obscurity, some of
them dead

odour of blood

also filled

spasm sweating

torches

et at times through changeful season and scene, abrupt,--alone, or in the
crowded street,--

ome up from the fields, father, heres a letter from our ete
nd come to the front door, mother--heres a letter from thy dear son
o, tis autumn
o, where the trees, deeper green, yellower and redder,
ool and sweeten hios villages, with leaves fluttering in the moderate
wind
here apples ripe in the orchards hang, and grapes on the trellised vines
mell you the smell of the grapes on the vines?
mell you the buckwheat, where the bees were lately buzzing?
bove all, lo, the sky, so calm, so transparent after the rain, and with
wondrous clouds
elow, too, all calm, all vital and beautiful--and the farm prospers well
own in the fields all prospers well
ut now from the fields come, father--come at the daughters call
nd come to the entry, mother--to the front door come, right away
ast as she can she hurries--something ominous--her steps trembling
he does not tarry to smooth her white hair, nor adjust her cap
pen the envelope quickly
 this is not our sons writing, yet his name is signed
 a strange hand writes for our dear son-- stricken mothers soul
ll swims before her eyes--flashes with black--she catches the main words
only
entences broken--gun-shot wound in the breast, cavalry skirmish, taken
to hospital,
t present low, but will soon be better
h, now the single figure to me,
mid all teeming and wealthy hio, with all its cities and farms,
ickly white in the face and dull in the head, very faint,
y the jamb of a door leans
rieve not so, dear mother, the just-grown daughter speaks through her
sobs
he little sisters huddle around, speechless and dismayed
ee, dearest mother, the letter says ete will soon be better
las poor boy, he will never be better, nor maybe needs to be better,
that brave and simple soul
hile they stand at home at the door, he is dead already
he only son is dead
ut the mother needs to be better
he, with thin form, presently dressed in black
y day her meals untouched--then at night fitfully sleeping, often waking,
n the midnight waking, weeping, longing with one deep longing,
 that she might withdraw unnoticed--silent from life escape and withdraw,
o follow, to seek, to be with her dear dead son
 
n clouds descending, in midnight sleep, of many a face in battle,
f the look at first of the mortally wounded, of that indescribable look,
f the dead on their backs, with arms extended wide--
 dream,  dream,  dream
f scenes of nature, the fields and the mountains,
f the skies so beauteous after the storm, and at night the
moon so unearthly bright,
hining sweetly, shining down, where we dig the trenches,
and gather the heaps--
 dream,  dream,  dream
ong have they passed, long lapsed--faces, and trenches, and fields
ong through the carnage  moved with a callous composure, or away from the
fallen
nward  sped at the time ut now of their faces and forms, at night,

nd through the stillness, through the dark,  hear, just hear, the breath
of my infant,
here in the room, as  wake from sleep, this vision presses upon me
he engagement opens there and then, in my busy brain unreal
he skirmishers begin--they crawl cautiously ahead-- hear the irregular
snap snap
 hear the sound of the different missiles--the short t-h-t t-h-t of
the rifle-balls
 see the shells exploding, leaving small white clouds-- hear the great
shells shrieking as they pass
he grape, like the hum and whirr of wind through the trees, quick,
tumultuous, now the contest rages
ll the scenes at the batteries themselves rise in detail before me again
he crashing and smoking--the pride of the men in their pieces
he chief gunner ranges and sights his piece, and selects a fuse of the
right time
fter firing,  see him lean aside, and look eagerly off to note the
effect
--lsewhere  hear the cry of a regiment charging--the young colonel leads
himself this time, with brandished sword
 see the gaps cut by the enemys volleys, quickly filled up--no delay
 breathe the suffocating smoke--then the flat clouds hover low, concealing
all
ow a strange lull comes for a few seconds, not a shot fired on either
side
hen resumed, the chaos louder than ever, with eager calls, and orders of
officers
hile from some distant part of the field the wind wafts to my ears a shout
of applause, some special success
nd ever the sound of the cannon, far or near, rousing, even in dreams, a
devilish exultation, and all the old mad joy, in the depths of my
soul
nd ever the hastening of infantry shifting positions--batteries, cavalry,
moving hither and thither
he falling, dying,  heed not--the wounded, dripping and red,  heed not--
some to the rear are hobbling
rime, heat, rush--aides-de-camp galloping by, or on a full run
ith the patter of small arms, the warning s-s-t of the rifles, these in
my vision  hear or see,
nd bombs bursting in air, and at night the vari-coloured rockets

oved loved loved loved loved
ut my love no more, no more with me
e two together no more
he aria sinking
ll else continuing--the stars shining,
he winds blowing--the notes of the bird continuous echoing,
ith angry moans the fierce old other incessantly moaning,
n the sands of aumanoks shore, grey and rustling
he yellow half-moon enlarged, sagging down, drooping, the face of the sea
almost touching
he boy ecstatic--with his bare feet the waves, with his hair the
atmosphere, dallying,
he love in the heart long pent, now loose, now at last tumultuously
bursting
he arias meaning the ears, the soul, swiftly depositing,
he strange tears down the cheeks coursing
he colloquy there--the trio--each uttering
he undertone--the savage old other, incessantly crying,
o the boys souls questions sullenly timing--some drowned secret hissing
o the outsetting bard of love
emon or bird said the boys soul,
s it indeed toward your mate you sing? or is it mostly to me?
or , that was a child, my tongues use sleeping,
ow  have heard you,
ow in a moment  know what  am for-- awake
nd already a thousand singers--a thousand songs, clearer, louder, and more
sorrowful than yours,
 thousand warbling echoes, have started to life within me,
ever to die
 you singer, solitary, singing by yourself--projecting me
 solitary me, listening--never more shall  cease perpetuating you
ever more shall  escape, never more, the reverberations,
ever more the cries of unsatisfied love be absent from me,
ever again leave me to be the peaceful child  was before what there, in
the night,
y the sea, under the yellow and sagging moon,
he messenger there aroused--the fire, the sweet hell within,
he unknown want, the destiny of me
 give me the clue it lurks in the night here somewhere
 if  am to have so much, let me have more
 a word  what is my destination?  fear it is henceforth chaos--
 how joys, dreads, convolutions, human shapes and all shapes, spring as
from graves around me
 phantoms you cover all the land, and all the sea
  cannot see in the dimness whether you smile or frown upon me
 vapour, a look, a word  well-beloved
 you dear womens and mens phantoms
 word then, for  will conquer it,
he word final, superior to all,
ubtle, sent up--what is it?-- listen
re you whispering it, and have been all the time, you sea-waves?
s that it from your liquid rims and wet sands?
hereto answering, the ea,
elaying not, hurrying not,
hispered me through the night, and very plainly before daybreak,
isped to me the low and delicious word 
nd again eath--ever eath, eath, eath,
issing melodious, neither like the bird nor like my aroused childs heart,
ut edging near, as privately for me, rustling at my feet,
reeping thence steadily up to my ears, and laving me softly all over,
eath, eath, eath, eath, eath
hich  do not forget,
ut fuse the song of my dusky demon and brother,
hat he sang to me in the moonlight on aumanoks grey beach,
ith the thousand responsive songs, at random,
y own songs, awaked from that hour
nd with them the key, the word up from the waves,
he word of the sweetest song, and all songs,
hat strong and delicious word which, creeping to my feet,
he ea whispered me
  
lood-tide below me  watch you face to face
louds of the west sun there half an hour high  see you also face to
face
rowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes, how curious you are
to me
n the ferry-boats the hundreds and hundreds that cross, returning home,
are more curious to me than you suppose
nd you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are more to me,
and more in my meditations, than you might suppose
he impalpable sustenance of me from all things, at all hours of the day
he simple, compact, well-joined scheme--myself disintegrated, every one
disintegrated, yet part of the scheme
he similitudes of the past, and those of the future
he glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings--on the
walk in the street, and the passage over the river
he current rushing so swiftly, and swimming with me far away
he others that are to follow me, the ties between me and them
he certainty of others--the life, love, sight, hearing, of others
thers will enter the gates of the ferry, and cross from shore to shore
thers will watch the run of the flood-tide
thers will see the shipping of anhattan north and west, and the heights
of rooklyn to the south and east
thers will see the islands large and small
ifty years hence, others will see them as they cross, the sun half an hour
high
 hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence, others will see
them,
ill enjoy the sunset, the pouring-in of the flood-tide, the falling-back
to the sea of the ebb-tide
t avails not, neither time nor place--distance avails not
 am with you--you men and women of a generation, or ever so many
generations hence
 project myself--also  return-- am with you, and know how it is
ust as you feel when you look on the river and sky, so  felt
ust as any of you is one of a living crowd,  was one of a crowd
ust as you are refreshed by the gladness of the river and the bright flow,
 was refreshed
ust as you stand and lean on the rail, yet hurry with the swift current, 
stood, yet was hurried
ust as you look on the numberless masts of ships, and the
thick-stemmed pipes of steamboats,  looked
 too many and many a time crossed the river, the sun half an hour high
 watched the twelfth-month sea-gulls-- saw them high in the air, floating
with motionless wings, oscillating their bodies,
 saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies, and left the
rest in strong shadow,
 saw the slow-wheeling circles, and the gradual edging toward the south
 too saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water,
ad my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams,
ooked at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my head
in the sun-lit water,
ooked on the haze on the hills southward and southwestward,
ooked on the vapour as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet,
ooked toward the lower bay to notice the arriving ships,
aw their approach, saw aboard those that were near me,
aw the white sails of schooners and sloops, saw the ships at anchor,
he sailors at work in the rigging, or out astride the spars
he round masts, the swinging motion of the hulls, the slender serpentine
pennants,
he large and small steamers in motion, the pilots in their
pilot-houses,
he white wake left by the passage, the quick tremulous whirl of the
wheels,
he flags of all nations, the falling of them at sunset,
he scallop-edged waves in the twilight, the ladled cups, the frolicsome
crests and glistening,
he stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the grey walls of the granite
store-houses by the docks,
n the river the shadowy group, the big steam-tug closely flanked on each
side by the barges--the hay-boat, the belated lighter,
n the neighbouring shore, the fires from the foundry chimneys burning high
and glaringly into the night,
asting their flicker of black, contrasted with wild red and yellow light,
over the tops of houses and down into the clefts of streets
hese, and all else, were to me the same as they are to you
 project myself a moment to tell you--also  return
 loved well those cities
 loved well the stately and rapid river
he men and women  saw were all near to me
thers the same--others who look back on me because  looked forward to
them
he time will come, though  stop here to-day and to-night
hat is it, then, between us?
hat is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us?
hatever it is, it avails not--distance avails not, and place avails not
 too lived--rooklyn, of ample hills, was mine
 too walked the streets of anhattan sland, and bathed in the waters
around it
 too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me
n the day, among crowds of people, sometimes they came upon me,
n my walks home late at night, or as  lay in my bed, they came upon me
 too had been struck from the float for ever held in solution,  too had
received identity by my ody
hat  was,  knew, was of my body--and what  should be,  knew,  should
be of my body
t is not upon you alone the dark patches fall,
he dark threw patches down upon me also
he best  had done seemed to me blank and suspicious
y great thoughts, as  supposed them, were they not in reality meagre?
would not people laugh at me?
t is not you alone who know what it is to be evil
 am he who knew what it was to be evil
 too knitted the old knot of contrariety,
labbed, blushed, resented, lied, stole, grudged
ad guile, anger, lust, hot wishes  dared not speak
as wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant
he wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me
he cheating look, the frivolous word, the adulterous wish, not wanting
efusals, hates, postponements, meanness, laziness, none of these wanting
ut  was anhattanese, friendly and proud

saw me approaching or passing,
elt their arms on my neck as  stood, or the negligent leaning of their
flesh against me as  sat
aw many  loved in the street, or ferry-boat, or public assembly, yet
never told them a word
ived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing,
sleeping

that looks in my face,

impressing me
s  ebbed with an ebb of the ocean of life,

s  walked where the sea-ripples wash you, aumanok,
here they rustle up, hoarse and sibilant,
here the fierce old other endlessly cries for her castaways,
, musing, late in the autumn day, gazing off southward,
lone, held by this eternal self of me, out of the pride of which  have
uttered my poems,
as seized by the spirit that trails in the lines underfoot,
n the rim, the sediment, that stands for all the water and all the land of
the globe
ascinated, my eyes, reverting from the south, dropped, to follow those
slender winrows,
haff, straw, splinters of wood, weeds, and the sea-gluten,
cum, scales from shining rocks, leaves of salt-lettuce, left by the tide
iles walking, the sound of breaking waves the other side of me,
aumanok, there and then, as  thought the old thought of likenesses
hese you presented to me, you fish-shaped sland,

s  walked with that eternal self of me, seeking types

s  list to the dirge, the voices of men and women wrecked,
s  inhale the impalpable breezes that set in upon me,
s the ocean so mysterious rolls toward me closer and closer,
 too but signify, at the utmost, a little washed-up drift,
 few sands and dead leaves to gather,
ather, and merge myself as part of the sands and drift
 baffled, baulked, bent to the very earth,
ppressed with myself that  have dared to open my mouth,
ware now that, amid all the blab whose echoes recoil upon me,  have not
once had the least idea who or what  am,
ut that before all my insolent poems, the real  stands yet untouched,
untold, altogether unreached,
ithdrawn far, mocking me with mock-congratulatory signs and bows,
ith peals of distant ironical laughter at every word  have written,
ointing in silence to all these songs, and then to the sand beneath
ow  perceive  have not understood anything--not a single object--and
that no man ever can

your shores

its orbit for ever and ever, without one jolt, or the untruth of a

billions of years,

builds a house

winters, to articulate and walk--ll this is equally wonderful

ever seeing each other, and never perhaps to see each other, is
every bit as wonderful

nd that  can remind you, and you think them and know them to be true, is
just as wonderful

wonderful

wonderful

one  love,
r sit at the table at dinner with my mother,
r look at strangers opposite me riding in the car,
r watch honey-bees busy around the hive, of a summer forenoon,
r animals feeding in the fields,

bright,

very cubic foot of the interior swarms with the same
very spear of grass--the frames, limbs, organs, of men and women, and all
that concerns them,

he cactus, guarded with thorns--the laurel-tree, with large white flowers

mistletoe and trailing moss,
he piney odour and the gloom--the awful natural stillness, ere in these
dense swamps the freebooter carries his gun, and the fugitive slave
has his concealed hut
 the strange fascination of these half-known, half-impassable swamps,
infested by reptiles, resounding with the bellow of the alligator,
the sad noises of the night-owl and the wild-cat, and the whirr of
the rattlesnake
he mocking-bird, the merican mimic, singing all the forenoon--singing
through the moon-lit night,
he humming-bird, the wild-turkey, the raccoon, the opossum

flapping, bright green, with tassels--with beautiful ears, each
well-sheathed in its husk

 to be a irginian, where  grew up  to be a arolinian

not, surround us and pervade us,

ublish my name and hang up my picture as that of the tenderest lover,
he friend, the lovers portrait, of whom his friend, his lover, was
fondest,
ho was not proud of his songs, but of the measureless ocean of love within
him--and freely poured it forth,
ho often walked lonesome walks, thinking of his dear friends, his lovers,
ho pensive, away from one he loved, often lay sleepless and dissatisfied
at night,
ho knew too well the sick, sick dread lest the one he loved might secretly
be indifferent to him,
hose happiest days were far away, through fields, in woods, on hills, he
and another, wandering hand in hand, they twain, apart from other
men,
ho oft, as he sauntered the streets, curved with his arm the shoulder of
his friend--while the arm of his friend rested upon him also
 
hen  heard at the close of the day how my name had been received with
plaudits in the capitol, still it was not a happy night for me that
followed
nd else, when  caroused, or when my plans were accomplished, still  was
not happy
ut the day when  rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health, refreshed,
singing, inhaling the ripe breath of autumn,
hen  saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in the morning
light,
hen  wandered alone over the beach, and undressing bathed, laughing with
the cool waters, and saw the sunrise,
nd when  thought how my dear friend, my lover, was on his way coming, 
then  was happy
 then each breath tasted sweeter--and all that day my food nourished me
more--and the beautiful day passed well,
nd the next came with equal joy--and with the next, at evening, came my
friend
nd that night, while all was still,  heard the waters roll slowly
continually up the shores,
 heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands, as directed to me,
whispering, to congratulate me
or the one  love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover in the cool
night,
n the stillness, in the autumn moonbeams, his face was inclined toward me,
nd his arm lay lightly around my breast--and that night  was happy
 
f him  love day and night,  dreamed  heard he was dead
nd  dreamed  went where they had buried him  love--but he was not in
that place
nd  dreamed  wandered, searching among burial-places, to find him
nd  found that every place was a burial-place
he houses full of life were equally full of death, this house is now
he streets, the shipping, the places of amusement, the hicago, oston,
hiladelphia, the annahatta, were as full of the dead as of the living,
nd fuller,  vastly fuller, of the dead than of the living
--nd what  dreamed  will henceforth tell to every person and age,
nd  stand henceforth bound to what  dreamed
nd now  am willing to disregard burial-places, and dispense with them
nd if the memorials of the dead were put up indifferently everywhere, even
in the room where  eat or sleep,  should be satisfied
nd if the corpse of any one  love, or if my own corpse, be duly rendered
to powder, and poured in the sea,  shall be satisfied
r if it be distributed to the winds,  shall be satisfied

other dialects

it cannot be answered

universal than he is

very existence has its idiom--everything has an idiom and tongue

old dash of waves at the ferry-wharf--posh and ice in the river, half-
frozen mud in the streets, a grey discouraged sky overhead, the
short last daylight of welfth-month,

roadway stage-driver, the cortege mostly drivers
teady the trot to the cemetery, duly rattles the death-bell, the gate is
passed, the new-dug grave is halted at, the living alight, the
hearse uncloses,

coffin, the earth is swiftly shovelled in,

e was a good fellow, free-mouthed, quick-tempered, not bad-looking, able
to take his own part, witty, sensitive to a slight, ready with life
or death for a friend, fond of women, gambled, ate hearty, drank
hearty, had known what it was to be flush, grew low-spirited toward
the last, sickened, was helped by a contribution, died, aged forty-
one years--and that was his funeral

to think how wide a difference

maternal cares?

our farm, profits, crops,--to think how engrossed you are
o think there will still be farms, profits, crops--yet for you, of what
avail?
hat will be will be well--for what is is well
o take interest is well, and not to take interest shall be well
he sky continues beautiful,
he pleasure of men with women shall never be sated, nor the pleasure of
women with men, nor the pleasure from poems
he domestic joys, the daily housework or business, the building of
houses--these are not phantasms--they have weight, form, location
arms, profits, crops, markets, wages, government, are none of them
phantasms
he difference between sin and goodness is no delusion,
he earth is not an echo--man and his life, and all the things of his life,
are well-considered
ou are not thrown to the winds--you gather certainly and safely around
yourself
ourself ourself ourself, for ever and ever
t is not to diffuse you that you were born of your mother and father--it

be decided

 have dreamed that we are not to be changed so much, nor the law of us
changed,
 have dreamed that heroes and good-doers shall be under the present and
past law,
nd that murderers, drunkards, liars, shall be under the present and past
law,
or  have dreamed that the law they are under now is enough
nd  have dreamed that the satisfaction is not so much changed, and that
there is no life without satisfaction
hat is the earth? what are ody and oul without satisfaction?
 shall go with the rest,
e cannot be stopped at a given point--that is no satisfaction,
o show us a good thing, or a few good things, for a space of time--that is
no satisfaction,
e must have the indestructible breed of the best, regardless of time
f otherwise, all these things came but to ashes of dung,
f maggots and rats ended us, then alarum for we are betrayed
hen indeed suspicion of death
o you suspect death? f  were to suspect death,  should die now
o you think  could walk pleasantly and well-suited toward annihilation?
leasantly and well-suited  walk
hither  walk  cannot define, but  know it is good
he whole universe indicates that it is good,
he past and the present indicate that it is good
ow beautiful and perfect are the animals ow perfect is my oul
ow perfect the earth, and the minutest thing upon it
hat is called good is perfect, and what is called bad is just as perfect,
he vegetables and minerals are all perfect, and the imponderable fluids
are perfect
lowly and surely they have passed on to this, and slowly and surely they
yet pass on
y oul if  realise you,  have satisfaction
nimals and vegetables if  realise you,  have satisfaction
aws of the earth and air if  realise you,  have satisfaction
 cannot define my satisfaction, yet it is so
 cannot define my life, yet it is so
t comes to me now
 swear  think now that everything without exception has an eternal soul
he trees have, rooted in the ground the weeds of the sea have the
animals
 swear  think there is nothing but immortality
hat the exquisite scheme is for it, and the nebulous float is for it, and
the cohering is for it
nd all preparation is for it and identity is for it and life and death
are altogether for it
 
omething startles me where  thought  was safest
 withdraw from the still woods  loved
 will not go now on the pastures to walk
 will not strip the clothes from my body to meet my lover the sea
 will not touch my flesh to the earth, as to other flesh, to renew me
 how can the ground not sicken?
ow can you be alive, you growths of spring?
ow can you furnish health, you blood of herbs, roots, orchards, grain?
re they not continually putting distempered corpses in you?
s not every continent worked over and over with sour dead?
here have you disposed of their carcasses?
hose drunkards and gluttons of so many generations
here have you drawn off all the foul liquid and meat?
 do not see any of it upon you to-day--or perhaps  am deceived
 will run a furrow with my plough-- will press my spade through the sod,
and turn it up underneath
 am sure  shall expose some of the foul meat
ehold this compost behold it well
erhaps every mite has once formed part of a sick person--et behold
he grass covers the prairies,
he bean bursts noiselessly through the mould in the garden,
he delicate spear of the onion pierces upward,
he apple-buds cluster together on the apple branches,
he resurrection of the wheat appears with pale visage out of its graves,
he tinge awakes over the willow-tree and the mulberry-tree,
he he-birds carol mornings and evenings, while the she-birds sit on their
nests,
he young of poultry break through the hatched eggs,
he new-born of animals appear--the calf is dropped from the cow, the colt
from the mare,
ut of its little hill faithfully rise the potatos dark-green leaves,
ut of its hill rises the yellow maize-stalk
he summer growth is innocent and disdainful above all those strata of sour
dead
hat chemistry
hat the winds are really not infectious,
hat this is no cheat, this transparent green-wash of the sea, which is so
amorous after me
hat it is safe to allow it to lick my naked body all over with its
tongues,
hat it will not endanger me with the fevers that have deposited themselves
in it,
hat all is clean for ever and for ever,
hat the cool drink from the well tastes so good,
hat blackberries are so flavorous and juicy,
hat the fruits of the apple-orchard, and of the orange-orchard--that
melons, grapes, peaches, plums, will none of them poison me,
hat when  recline on the grass  do not catch any disease,
hough probably every sphere of grass rises out of what was once a catching
disease
ow  am terrified at the arth it is that calm and patient,
t grows such sweet things out of such corruptions,
t turns harmless and stainless on its axis, with such endless successions
of diseased corpses,
t distils such exquisite winds out of such infused fetor,
t renews with such unwitting looks its prodigal, annual, sumptuous crops,
t gives such divine materials to men, and accepts such leavings from them
at last
 
espairing cries float ceaselessly toward me, day and night,
he sad voice of eath--the call of my nearest lover, putting forth,
alarmed, uncertain,
he ea  am quickly to sail come tell me,
ome tell me where  am speeding--tell me my destination
 understand your anguish, but  cannot help you
 approach, hear, behold--the sad mouth, the look out of the eyes, your
mute inquiry,
hither  go from the bed  recline on, come tell me
ld age, alarmed, uncertain-- young womans voice, appealing to me for
comfort
 young mans voice, hall  not escape?

are for nothing

re those women of the old experience of the earth gone?
o their lives, cities, arts, rest only with us?
id they achieve nothing for good, for themselves?
 believe, of all those billions of men and women that filled the unnamed
lands, every one exists this hour, here or elsewhere, invisible to
us, in exact proportion to what he or she grew from in life, and
out of what he or she did, felt, became, loved, sinned, in life

more than this shall be the end of my nation, or of me

of what accrued to them in the seen world

he indications and tally of time
erfect sanity shows the master among philosophs
ime, always without flaw, indicates itself in parts
hat always indicates the poet is the crowd of the pleasant company of
singers, and their words
he words of the singers are the hours or minutes of the light or dark--but
the words of the maker of poems are the general light and dark
he maker of poems settles justice, reality, immortality,
is insight and power encircle things and the human race,
e is the glory and extract, thus far, of things and of the human race
he singers do not beget--only the  begets
he singers are welcomed, understood, appear often enough--but rare has the
day been, likewise the spot, of the birth of the maker of poems
ot every century, or every five centuries, has contained such a day, for
all its names
he singers of successive hours of centuries may have ostensible names, but
the name of each of them is one of the singers
he name of each is eye-singer, ear-singer, head-singer,
sweet-singer, echo-singer, parlour-singer, love-singer, or something else
ll this time, and at all times, wait the words of poems
he greatness of sons is the exuding of the greatness of mothers and
fathers
he words of poems are the tuft and final applause of science
ivine instinct, breadth of vision, the law of reason, health, rudeness of
body, withdrawnness, gaiety, sun-tan, air-sweetness--such are some
of the words of poems
he sailor and traveller underlie the maker of poems,
he builder, geometer, chemist, anatomist, phrenologist, artist--all these
underlie the maker of poems
he words of the true poems give you more than poems,
hey give you, to form for yourself, poems, religions, politics, war,
peace, behaviour, histories, essays, romances, and everything else,
hey balance ranks, colours, races, creeds, and the sexes,
hey do not seek beauty--they are sought,
or ever touching them, or close upon them, follows beauty, longing, fain,
love-sick
hey prepare for death--yet are they not the finish, but rather the outset,
hey bring none to his or her terminus, or to be content and full
hom they take, they take into space, to behold the birth of stars, to
learn one of the meanings,
o launch off with absolute faith--to sweep through the ceaseless rings,
and never be quiet again
  
ou who celebrate bygones
ho have explored the outward, the surfaces of the races--the life that has
exhibited itself
ho have treated of man as the creature of politics, aggregates, rulers,
and priests
, habitu of the lleghanies, treating man as he is in himself, in his own
rights,
ressing the pulse of the life that has seldom exhibited itself, the great
pride of man in himself
hanter of ersonality, outlining what is yet to be
 project the history of the future
 
hoever you are, holding me now in hand,
ithout one thing, all will be useless
 give you fair warning, before you attempt me further,
 am not what you supposed, but far different
ho is he that would become my follower?
ho would sign himself a candidate for my affections?
he way is suspicious--the result uncertain, perhaps destructive
ou would have to give up all else-- alone would expect to be your od,
sole and exclusive
our novitiate would even then be long and exhausting,
he whole past theory of your life, and all conformity to the lives around
you, would have to be abandoned
herefore release me now, before troubling yourself any further--et go
your hand from my shoulders,
ut me down, and depart on your way
r else, by stealth, in some wood, for trial,
r back of a rock, in the open air,
or in any roofed room of a house  emerge not--nor in company,
nd in libraries  lie as one dumb, a gawk, or unborn, or dead,
ut just possibly with you on a high hill--first watching lest any person,
for miles around, approach unawares--
r possibly with you sailing at sea, or on the beach of the sea, or some
quiet island,
ere to put your lips upon mine  permit you,
ith the comrades long-dwelling kiss, or the new husbands kiss,
or  am the new husband, and  am the comrade
r, if you will, thrusting me beneath your clothing,
here  may feel the throbs of your heart, or rest upon your hip,
arry me when you go forth over land or sea
or thus, merely touching you, is enough--is best,
nd thus, touching you, would  silently sleep, and be carried eternally
ut these leaves conning, you con at peril,
or these leaves, and me, you will not understand,
hey will elude you at first, and still more afterward-- will certainly
elude you,
ven while you should think you had unquestionably caught me, behold
lready you see  have escaped from you
or it is not for what  have put into it that  have written this book,
or is it by reading it you will acquire it,
or do those know me best who admire me, and vauntingly praise me,
or will the candidates for my love unless at most a very few prove
victorious,
or will my poems do good only--they will do just as much evil, perhaps
more
or all is useless without that which you may guess at many times and not
hit--that which  hinted at
herefore release me, and depart on your way

ollecting,  traverse the garden, the world--but soon  pass the gates,
ow along the pond-side--now wading in a little, fearing not the wet,
ow by the post-and-rail fences, where the old stones thrown there, picked
from the fields, have accumulated,
ild flowers and vines and weeds come up through the stones, and partly
cover them--eyond these  pass,

olitary, smelling the earthy smell, stopping now and then in the silence
lone,  had thought--yet soon a silent troop gathers around me
ome walk by my side, and some behind, and some embrace my arms or neck,
hey, the spirits of friends, dead or alive--thicker they come, a great
crowd, and  in the middle,
ollecting, dispensing, singing in spring, there  wander with them,
lucking something for tokens--tossing toward whoever is near me
ere lilac, with a branch of pine,
ere, out of my pocket, some moss which  pulled off a live-oak in lorida,
as it hung trailing down,
ere some pinks and laurel leaves, and a handful of sage,
nd here what  now draw from the water, wading in the pond-side,
 here  last saw him that tenderly loves me--and returns again, never to
separate from me,
nd this,  this shall henceforth be the token of comrades--this alamus-
root shall,
nterchange it, youths, with each other et none render it back
nd twigs of maple, and a bunch of wild orange, and chestnut,
nd stems of currants, and plum-blows, and the aromatic cedar,
hese , compassed around by a thick cloud of spirits,
andering, point to, or touch as  pass, or throw them loosely from me,
ndicating to each one what he shall have--giving something to each
ut what  drew from the water by the pond-side, that  reserve
 will give of it--but only to them that love as  myself am capable of
loving
ootnote   am favoured with the following indication, from r hitman
himself, of the relation in which this word alamus is to be
understood--alamus is the very large and aromatic grass or rush growing
about water-ponds in the valleys--spears about three feet high often
called weet lag grows all over the orthern and iddle tates he
recherch or ethereal sense of the term, as used in my book, arises
probably from the actual alamus presenting the biggest and hardiest kind
of spears of grass, and their fresh, aquatic, pungent bouquet

and along the shores of the great lakes, and all over the prairies
 will make inseparable cities, with their arms about each others necks
y the love of comrades,
y the manly love of comrades
or you these, from me,  emocracy, to serve you, ma femme
or you for you,  am trilling these songs,

ot in this beating and pounding at my temples and wrists
ot in the curious systole and diastole within, which will one day cease
ot in many a hungry wish, told to the skies only
ot in cries, laughter, defiances, thrown from me when alone, far in the
wilds

ootnote   suppose hitman gets this odd word lumin, by a process of
his own, out of illuminati, and intends it to stand for what would be
called clairvoyance, intuition

compact,
 announce splendours and majesties to make all the previous politics of
the earth insignificant

urious enveloped messages delivering,
parkles hot, seed ethereal, down in the dirt dropping,
yself unknowing, my commission obeying, to question it never daring,
o ages, and ages yet, the growth of the seed leaving,
o troops out of me rising--they the tasks  have set promulging,
o women certain whispers of myself bequeathing--their affection me more
clearly explaining,
o young men my problems offering--no dallier -- the muscle of their
brains trying,
o  pass--a little time vocal, visible, contrary,
fterward, a melodious echo, passionately bent for--death making me really
undying,--

incessantly preparing
