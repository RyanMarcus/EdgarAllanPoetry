starting from fishshape paumanok, where i was born,
wellbegotten, and raised by a perfect mother
after roaming many landslover of populous pavements
dweller in mannahatta, city of ships, my city,or on southern savannas
or a soldier camped, or carrying my knapsack and gunor a miner in
california
or rude in my home in dakotahs woods, my diet meat, my drink from the
spring
or withdrawn to muse and meditate in some deep recess,
far from the clank of crowds, intervals passing, rapt and happy
aware of the fresh free giver, the flowing missouriaware of mighty
niagara
aware of the buffalo herds, grazing the plainsthe hirsute and strong
breasted bull
of earths, rocks, fifthmonth flowers, experiencedstars, rain, snow, my
amaze
having studied the mockingbirds tones, and the mountain hawks,
and heard at dusk the unrivalled one, the hermit thrush, from the
swampcedars,
solitary, singing in the west, i strike up for a new world

victory, union, faith, identity, time,
yourself, the present and future lands, the indissoluble compacts, riches,
mystery,
eternal progress, the kosmos, and the modern reports
this, then, is life
here is what has come to the surface after so many throes and convulsions
how curious how real
under foot the divine soilover head the sun
see, revolving, the globe
the ancestorcontinents, away, grouped together
the present and future continents, north and south, with the isthmus
between
see, vast trackless spaces
as in a dream, they change, they swiftly fill
countless masses debouch upon them
they are now covered with the foremost people, arts, institutions, known
see, projected through time,
for me an audience interminable
with firm and regular step they wendthey never stop,
successions of men, americanos, a hundred millions
one generation playing its part, and passing on,
another generation playing its part, and passing on in its turn,
with faces turned sideways or backward towards me, to listen,
with eyes retrospective towards me

americanos conquerors marches humanitarian
foremost century marches libertad masses
for you a programme of chants
chants of the prairies
chants of the longrunning mississippi, and down to the mexican sea
chants of ohio, indiana, illinois, iowa, wisconsin, and minnesota
chants going forth from the centre, from kansas, and thence, equidistant,
shooting in pulses of fire, ceaseless, to vivify all

in the year  of the states,
my tongue, every atom of my blood, formed from this soil, this air,
born here of parents born here, from parents the same, and their parents
the same,
i, now thirtysix years old, in perfect health begin,
hoping to cease not till death
creeds and schools in abeyance,
retiring back a while, sufficed at what they are, but never forgotten
i harbour, for good or badi permit to speak, at every hazard
nature now without check, with original energy

take my leaves, america take them south, and take them north
make welcome for them everywhere, for they are your own offspring
surround them, east and west for they would surround you
and you precedents connect lovingly with them, for they connect lovingly
with you
i conned old times
i sat studying at the feet of the great masters
now, if eligible, o that the great masters might return and study me
in the name of these states, shall i scorn the antique?
why, these are the children of the antique, to justify it

dead poets, philosophs, priests,
martyrs, artists, inventors, governments long since,
languageshapers on other shores,
nations once powerful, now reduced, withdrawn, or desolate,
i dare not proceed till i respectfully credit what you have left, wafted
hither
i have perused itown it is admirable, moving awhile among it
think nothing can ever be greaternothing can ever deserve more than it
deserves
regarding it all intently a long while, then dismissing it,
i stand in my place, with my own day, here
here lands female and male
here the heirship and heiressship of the worldhere the flame of
materials
here spirituality, the translatress, the openlyavowed,
the evertending, the finale of visible forms
the satisfier, after due longwaiting, now advancing,
yes, here comes my mistress, the soul

the soul
for ever and for everlonger than soil is brown and solidlonger than
water ebbs and flows
i will make the poems of materials, for i think they are to be the most
spiritual poems
and i will make the poems of my body and of mortality,
for i think i shall then supply myself with the poems of my soul, and of
immortality
i will make a song for these states, that no one state may under any
circumstances be subjected to another state
and i will make a song that there shall be comity by day and by night
between all the states, and between any two of them
and i will make a song for the ears of the president, full of weapons with
menacing points,
and behind the weapons countless dissatisfied faces
and a song make i, of the one formed out of all
the fanged and glittering one whose head is over all
resolute, warlike one, including and over all
however high the head of any else, that head is over all
i will acknowledge contemporary lands
i will trail the whole geography of the globe, and salute courteously every
city large and small
and employments i will put in my poems, that with you is heroism, upon
land and seaand i will report all heroism from an american point
of view
and sexual organs and acts do you concentrate in mefor i am determined
to tell you with courageous clear voice, to prove you illustrious
i will sing the song of companionship
i will show what alone must finally compact these
i believe these are to found their own ideal of manly love, indicating it
in me
i will therefore let flame from me the burning fires that were threatening
to consume me
i will lift what has too long kept down those smouldering fires
i will give them complete abandonment
i will write the evangelpoem of comrades and of love
for who but i should understand love, with all its sorrow and joy?
and who but i should be the poet of comrades?

i am the credulous man of qualities, ages, races
i advance from the people en masse in their own spirit
here is what sings unrestricted faith
omnes omnes let others ignore what they may
i make the poem of evil alsoi commemorate that part also
i am myself just as much evil as good, and my nation isand i say there is
in fact no evil,
or if there is, i say it is just as important to you, to the land, or to
me, as anything else
i too, following many, and followed by many, inaugurate a religioni too
go to the wars
it may be i am destined to utter the loudest cries thereof, the winners
pealing shouts
who knows? they may rise from me yet, and soar above everything
each is not for its own sake
i say the whole earth, and all the stars in the sky, are for religions
sake
i say no man has ever yet been half devout enough
none has ever yet adored or worshipped half enough
none has begun to think how divine he himself is, and how certain the
future is
i say that the real and permanent grandeur of these states must be their
religion
otherwise there is no real and permanent grandeur
nor character, nor life worthy the name, without religion
nor land, nor man or woman, without religion

what are you doing, young man?
are you so earnestso given up to literature, science, art, amours?
these ostensible realities, politics, points?
your ambition or business, whatever it may be?
it is wellagainst such i say not a wordi am their poet also
but behold such swiftly subsideburnt up for religions sake
for not all matter is fuel to heat, impalpable flame, the essential life of
the earth,
any more than such are to religion

what do you seek, so pensive and silent?
what do you need, camerado?
dear son do you think it is love?
listen, dear sonlisten, america, daughter or son
it is a painful thing to love a man or woman to excessand yet it
satisfiesit is great
but there is something else very greatit makes the whole coincide
it, magnificent, beyond materials, with continuous hands, sweeps and
provides for all

know you to drop in the earth the germs of a greater religion,
the following chants, each for its kind, i sing
my comrade
for you, to share with me, two greatnessesand a third one, rising
inclusive and more resplendent,
the greatness of love and democracyand the greatness of religion
mlange mine own the unseen and the seen
mysterious ocean where the streams empty
prophetic spirit of materials shifting and flickering around me
living beings, identities, now doubtless near us in the air, that we know
not of
contact daily and hourly that will not release me
these selectingthese, in hints, demanded of me
not he with a daily kiss onward from childhood kissing me
has winded and twisted around me that which holds me to him,
any more than i am held to the heavens, to the spiritual world,
and to the identities of the gods, my lovers, faithful and true,
after what they have done to me, suggesting themes
o such themes equalities
o amazement of things o divine average
o warblings under the sunushered, as now, or at noon, or setting
o strain, musical, flowing through agesnow reaching hither,
i take to your reckless and composite chordsi add to them, and cheerfully
pass them forward

as i have walked in alabama my morning walk,
i have seen where the shebird, the mockingbird, sat on her nest in the
briars, hatching her brood
i have seen the hebird also
i have paused to hear him, near at hand, inflating his throat, and joyfully
singing
and while i paused, it came to me that what he really sang for was not
there only,
nor for his mate nor himself only, nor all sent back by the echoes
but subtle, clandestine, away beyond,
a charge transmitted, and gift occult, for those being born

democracy
near at hand to you a throat is now inflating itself and joyfully singing
ma femme
for the brood beyond us and of us,
for those who belong here, and those to come,
i, exultant, to be ready for them, will now shake out carols stronger and
haughtier than have ever yet been heard upon earth
i will make the songs of passion, to give them their way,
and your songs, outlawed offendersfor i scan you with kindred eyes, and
carry you with me the same as any
i will make the true poem of riches,
to earn for the body and the mind whatever adheres, and goes forward, and
is not dropped by death
i will effuse egotism, and show it underlying alland i will be the bard
of personality
and i will show of male and female that either is but the equal of the
other
and i will show that there is no imperfection in the presentand can be
none in the future
and i will show that, whatever happens to anybody, it may be turned to
beautiful resultsand i will show that nothing can happen more beautiful
than death
and i will thread a thread through my poems that time and events are
compact,
and that all the things of the universe are perfect miracles, each as
profound as any
i will not make poems with reference to parts
but i will make leaves, poems, poemets, songs, says, thoughts, with
reference to ensemble
and i will not sing with reference to a day, but with reference to all
days
and i will not make a poem, nor the least part of a poem, but has reference
to the soul
because, having looked at the objects of the universe, i find there is no
one, nor any particle of one, but has reference to the soul

was somebody asking to see the soul?
see your own shape and countenancepersons, substances, beasts, the
trees, the running rivers, the rocks and sands
all hold spiritual joys, and afterwards loosen them
how can the real body ever die, and be buried?
of your real body, and any mans or womans real body,
item for item, it will elude the hands of the corpsecleaners, and pass to
fitting spheres,
carrying what has accrued to it from the moment of birth to the moment of
death
not the types set up by the printer return their impression, the meaning,
the main concern,
any more than a mans substance and life, or a womans substance and life,
return in the body and the soul,
indifferently before death and after death
behold the body includes and is the meaning, the main concernand
includes and is the soul
whoever you are how superb and how divine is your body, or any part of it

whoever you are to you endless announcements
daughter of the lands, did you wait for your poet?

afford the like to you?
whoever you are how can i but offer you divine leaves, that you also be
eligible as i am?
how can i but, as here, chanting, invite you for yourself to collect
bouquets of the incomparable feuillage of these states?
footnote
the pastpresent
i was looking a long while for the history of the past for myself, and for
these chantsand now i have found it
it is not in those paged fables in the libraries, them i neither accept
nor reject
it is no more in the legends than in all else
it is in the presentit is this earth today
it is in democracyin this americathe old world also
it is the life of one man or one woman today, the average man of today
it is languages, social customs, literatures, arts
it is the broad show of artificial things, ships, machinery, politics,
creeds, modern improvements, and the interchange of nations,
all for the average man of today
years of the unperformed
years of the unperformed your horizon risesi see it part away for more
august dramas
i see not america onlyi see not only libertys nation but other nations
embattling
i see tremendous entrances and exitsi see new combinationsi see the
solidarity of races
i see that force advancing with irresistible power on the worlds stage
have the old forces played their parts? are the acts suitable to them
closed?
i see freedom, completely armed, and victorious, and very haughty, with law
by her side, both issuing forth against the idea of caste
what historic denouements are these we so rapidly approach?
i see men marching and countermarching by swift millions
i see the frontiers and boundaries of the old aristocracies broken
i see the landmarks of european kings removed
i see this day the people beginning their landmarks, all others give way
never were such sharp questions asked as this day
never was average man, his soul, more energetic, more like a god
lo how he urges and urges, leaving the masses no rest
his daring foot is on land and sea everywherehe colonises the pacific,
the archipelagoes
with the steamship, the electric telegraph, the newspaper, the wholesale
engines of war,
with these, and the worldspreading factories, he interlinks all geography,
all lands
what whispers are these, o lands, running ahead of you, passing under the
seas?
are all nations communing? is there going to be but one heart to the globe?
is humanity forming en masse?for lo tyrants tremble, crowns grow dim
the earth, restive, confronts a new era, perhaps a general divine war
no one knows what will happen nextsuch portents fill the days and nights
years prophetical the space ahead as i walk, as i vainly try to pierce it,
is full of phantoms
unborn deeds, things soon to be, project their shapes around me
this incredible rush and heatthis strange ecstatic fever of dreams, o
years
your dreams, o years, how they penetrate through me i know not whether i
sleep or wake
the performed america and europe grow dim, retiring in shadow behind me,
the unperformed, more gigantic than ever, advance, advance upon me
flux
of these years i sing,
how they pass through convulsed pains, as through parturitions
how america illustrates birth, gigantic youth, the promise, the sure
fulfilment, despite of peopleillustrates evil as well as good
how many hold despairingly yet to the models departed, caste, myths,
obedience, compulsion, and to infidelity
how few see the arrived models, the athletes, the statesor see freedom or
spiritualityor hold any faith in results
but i see the athletesand i see the results glorious and inevitableand
they again leading to other results
how the great cities appearhow the democratic masses, turbulent, wilful,
as i love them,
how the whirl, the contest, the wrestle of evil with good, the sounding and
resounding, keep on and on
how society waits unformed, and is between things ended and things begun
how america is the continent of glories, and of the triumph of freedom, and
of the democracies, and of the fruits of society, and of all that
is begun
and how the states are complete in themselvesand how all triumphs and
glories are complete in themselves, to lead onward,
and how these of mine, and of the states, will in their turn be convulsed,
and serve other parturitions and transitions
and how all people, sights, combinations, the democratic masses, too,
serveand how every fact serves,
and how now, or at any time, each serves the exquisite transition of death
to working men

come closer to me
push close, my lovers, and take the best i possess
yield closer and closer, and give me the best you possess
this is unfinished business with mehow is it with you?
i was chilled with the cold types, cylinder, wet paper between us
male and female
i pass so poorly with paper and types, i must pass with the contact of
bodies and souls
american masses
i do not thank you for liking me as i am, and liking the touch of mei
know that it is good for you to do so

this is the poem of occupations
in the labour of engines and trades, and the labour of fields, i find the
developments,
and find the eternal meanings
workmen and workwomen
were all educations, practical and ornamental, well displayed out of me,
what would it amount to?
were i as the head teacher, charitable proprietor, wise statesman, what
would it amount to?
were i to you as the boss employing and paying you, would that satisfy you?
the learned, virtuous, benevolent, and the usual terms
a man like me, and never the usual terms
neither a servant nor a master am i
i take no sooner a large price than a small pricei will have my own,
whoever enjoys me
i will be even with you, and you shall be even with me
if you stand at work in a shop, i stand as nigh as the nighest in the same
shop
if you bestow gifts on your brother or dearest friend, i demand as good as
your brother or dearest friend
if your lover, husband, wife, is welcome by day or night, i must be
personally as welcome
if you become degraded, criminal, ill, then i become so for your sake
if you remember your foolish and outlawed deeds, do you think i cannot
remember my own foolish and outlawed deeds?
if you carouse at the table, i carouse at the opposite side of the table
if you meet some stranger in the streets, and love him or herwhy i often
meet strangers in the street, and love them
why, what have you thought of yourself?
is it you then that thought yourself less?
is it you that thought the president greater than you?
or the rich better off than you? or the educated wiser than you?
because you are greasy or pimpled, or that you was once drunk, or a thief,
or diseased, or rheumatic, or a prostitute, or are so now
or from frivolity or impotence, or that you are no scholar, and never saw
your name in print,
do you give in that you are any less immortal?

souls of men and women it is not you i call unseen, unheard, untouchable
and untouching
it is not you i go argue pro and con about, and to settle whether you are
alive or no
i own publicly who you are, if nobody else owns
grown, halfgrown, and babe, of this country and every country, indoors and
outdoors, one just as much as the other, i see,
and all else behind or through them
the wifeand she is not one jot less than the husband
the daughterand she is just as good as the son
the motherand she is every bit as much as the father
offspring of ignorant and poor, boys apprenticed to trades,
young fellows working on farms, and old fellows working on farms,
sailormen, merchantmen, coasters, immigrants,
all these i seebut nigher and farther the same i see
none shall escape me, and none shall wish to escape me
i bring what you much need, yet always have,
not money, amours, dress, eating, but as good
i send no agent or medium, offer no representative of value, but offer the
value itself
there is something that comes home to one now and perpetually
it is not what is printed, preached, discussedit eludes discussion and
print
it is not to be put in a bookit is not in this book
it is for you, whoever you areit is no farther from you than your hearing
and sight are from you
it is hinted by nearest, commonest, readiestit is ever provoked by them
you may read in many languages, yet read nothing about it
you may read the presidents message, and read nothing about it there
nothing in the reports from the state department or treasury department, or
in the daily papers or the weekly papers,
or in the census or revenue returns, prices current, or any accounts of
stock

the sun and stars that float in the open air
the appleshaped earth, and we upon itsurely the drift of them is
something grand
i do not know what it is, except that it is grand, and that it is
happiness,
and that the enclosing purport of us here is not a speculation, or bonmot,
or reconnoissance,
and that it is not something which by luck may turn out well for us, and
without luck must be a failure for us,
and not something which may yet be retracted in a certain contingency
the light and shade, the curious sense of body and identity, the greed that
with perfect complaisance devours all things, the endless pride and
outstretching of man, unspeakable joys and sorrows,
the wonder every one sees in every one else he sees, and the wonders that
fill each minute of time for ever,
what have you reckoned them for, camerado?
have you reckoned them for a trade, or farmwork? or for the profits of a
store?
or to achieve yourself a position? or to fill a gentlemans leisure, or a
ladys leisure?
have you reckoned the landscape took substance and form that it might be
painted in a picture?
or men and women that they might be written of, and songs sung?
or the attraction of gravity, and the great laws and harmonious
combinations, and the fluids of the air, as subjects for the
savans?
or the brown land and the blue sea for maps and charts?
or the stars to be put in constellations and named fancy names?
or that the growth of seeds is for agricultural tables, or agriculture
itself?
old institutionsthese arts, libraries, legends, collections, and the
practice handed along in manufactureswill we rate them so high?
will we rate our cash and business high?i have no objection
i rate them as high as the highestthen a child born of a woman and man i
rate beyond all rate
we thought our union grand, and our constitution grand
i do not say they are not grand and good, for they are
i am this day just as much in love with them as you
then i am in love with you, and with all my fellows upon the earth
we consider bibles and religions divinei do not say they are not divine
i say they have all grown out of you, and may grow out of you still
it is not they who give the lifeit is you who give the life
leaves are not more shed from the trees, or trees from the earth, than they
are shed out of you

when the psalm sings, instead of the singer
when the script preaches, instead of the preacher
when the pulpit descends and goes, instead of the carver that carved the
supporting desk
when i can touch the body of books, by night or by day, and when they touch
my body back again
when a university course convinces, like a slumbering woman and child
convince
when the minted gold in the vault smiles like the nightwatchmans
daughter
when warrantee deeds loafe in chairs opposite, and are my friendly
companions
i intend to reach them my hand, and make as much of them as i do of men and
women like you
the sum of all known reverence i add up in you, whoever you are
the president is there in the white house for youit is not you who are
here for him
the secretaries act in their bureaus for younot you here for them
the congress convenes every twelfth month for you
laws, courts, the forming of states, the charters of cities, the going and
coming of commerce and mails, are all for you
list close, my scholars dear
all doctrines, all politics and civilisation, exsurge from you
all sculpture and monuments, and anything inscribed anywhere, are tallied
in you
the gist of histories and statistics, as far back as the records reach, is
in you this hour, and myths and tales the same
if you were not breathing and walking here, where would they all be?
the most renowned poems would be ashes, orations and plays would be
vacuums
all architecture is what you do to it when you look upon it
did you think it was in the white or grey stone? or the lines of the arches
and cornices?
all music is what awakes from you, when you are reminded by the
instruments
it is not the violins and the cornetsit is not the oboe nor the beating
drums, nor the score of the baritone singer singing his sweet
romanzanor that of the mens chorus, nor that of the womens
chorus,
it is nearer and farther than they

will the whole come back then?
can each see signs of the best by a look in the lookingglass? is there
nothing greater or more?
does all sit there with you, with the mystic, unseen soul?
strange and hard that paradox true i give
objects gross and the unseen soul are one

song of the broadaxe

weapon, shapely, naked, wan
head from the mothers bowels drawn
wooded flesh and metal bone limb only one, and lip only one
greyblue leaf by redheat grown helve produced from a little seed sown
resting the grass amid and upon,
to be leaned, and to lean on
strong shapes, and attributes of strong shapesmasculine trades, sights
and sounds
long varied train of an emblem, dabs of music
fingers of the organist skipping staccato over the keys of the great organ

welcome are all earths lands, each for its kind
welcome are lands of pine and oak
welcome are lands of the lemon and fig
welcome are lands of gold
welcome are lands of wheat and maizewelcome those of the grape
welcome are lands of sugar and rice
welcome are cottonlandswelcome those of the white potato and sweet
potato
welcome are mountains, flats, sands, forests, prairies
welcome the rich borders of rivers, tablelands, openings,
welcome the measureless grazinglandswelcome the teeming soil of
orchards, flax, honey, hemp
welcome just as much the other more hardfaced lands
lands rich as lands of gold, or wheat and fruit lands
lands of mines, lands of the manly and rugged ores
lands of coal, copper, lead, tin, zinc
lands of iron lands of the make of the axe

the log at the woodpile, the axe supported by it
the sylvan hut, the vine over the doorway, the space cleared for a garden,
the irregular tapping of rain down on the leaves, after the storm is
lulled,
the wailing and moaning at intervals, the thought of the sea,
the thought of ships struck in the storm, and put on their beamends, and
the cutting away of masts
the sentiment of the huge timbers of oldfashioned houses and barns
the remembered print or narrative, the voyage at a venture of men,
families, goods,
the disembarkation, the founding of a new city,
the voyage of those who sought a new england and found itthe outset
anywhere,
the settlements of the arkansas, colorado, ottawa, willamette,
the slow progress, the scant fare, the axe, rifle, saddlebags
the beauty of all adventurous and daring persons,
the beauty of woodboys and woodmen, with their clear untrimmed faces,
the beauty of independence, departure, actions that rely on themselves,
the american contempt for statutes and ceremonies, the boundless impatience
of restraint,
the loose drift of character, the inkling through random types, the
solidification
the butcher in the slaughterhouse, the hands aboard schooners and sloops,
the raftsman, the pioneer,
lumbermen in their winter camp, daybreak in the woods, stripes of snow on
the limbs of trees, the occasional snapping,
the glad clear sound of ones own voice, the merry song, the natural life
of the woods, the strong days work,
the blazing fire at night, the sweet taste of supper, the talk, the bed of
hemlock boughs, and the bearskin
the housebuilder at work in cities or anywhere,
the preparatory jointing, squaring, sawing, mortising,
the hoistup of beams, the push of them in their places, laying them
regular, setting the studs by their tenons in the mortises,
according as they were prepared,
the blows of mallets and hammers, the attitudes of the men, their curved
limbs,
bending, standing, astride the beams, driving in pins, holding on by posts
and braces,
the hooked arm over the plate, the other arm wielding the axe,
the floormen forcing the planks close, to be nailed,
their postures bringing their weapons downward on the bearers,
the echoes resounding through the vacant building
the huge storehouse carried up in the city, well under way,
the six framing men, two in the middle, and two at each end, carefully
bearing on their shoulders a heavy stick for a crossbeam,
the crowded line of masons with trowels in their right hands, rapidly
laying the long sidewall, two hundred feet from front to rear,
the flexible rise and fall of backs, the continual click of the trowels
striking the bricks,
the bricks, one after another, each laid so workmanlike in its place, and
set with a knock of the trowelhandle,
the piles of materials, the mortar on the mortarboards, and the steady
replenishing by the hodmen
sparmakers in the sparyard, the swarming row of wellgrown apprentices,
the swing of their axes on the squarehewed log, shaping it toward the
shape of a mast,
the brisk short crackle of the steel driven slantingly into the pine,
the buttercoloured chips flying off in great flakes and slivers,
the limber motion of brawny young arms and hips in easy costumes
the constructor of wharves, bridges, piers, bulkheads, floats, stays
against the sea
the city firemanthe fire that suddenly bursts forth in the closepacked
square,
the arriving engines, the hoarse shouts, the nimble stepping and daring,
the strong command through the firetrumpets, the falling in line, the rise
and fall of the arms forcing the water,
the slender, spasmic bluewhite jetsthe bringing to bear of the hooks and
ladders, and their execution,
the crash and cutaway of connecting woodwork, or through floors, if the
fire smoulders under them,
the crowd with their lit faces, watchingthe glare and dense shadows
the forger at his forgefurnace, and the user of iron after him,
the maker of the axe large and small, and the welder and temperer,
the chooser breathing his breath on the cold steel, and trying the edge
with his thumb,
the one who cleanshapes the handle and sets it firmly in the socket
the shadowy processions of the portraits of the past users also,
the primal patient mechanics, the architects and engineers,
the faroff assyrian edifice and mizra edifice,
the roman lictors preceding the consuls,
the antique european warrior with his axe in combat,
the uplifted arm, the clatter of blows on the helmeted head,
the deathhowl, the limpsey tumbling body, the rush of friend and foe
thither,
the siege of revolted lieges determined for liberty,
the summons to surrender, the battering at castlegates, the truce and
parley
the sack of an old city in its time,
the bursting in of mercenaries and bigots tumultuously and disorderly,
roar, flames, blood, drunkenness, madness,
goods freely rifled from houses and temples, screams of women in the gripe
of brigands,
craft and thievery of campfollowers, men running, old persons despairing,
the hell of war, the cruelties of creeds,
the list of all executive deeds and words, just or unjust,
the power of personality, just or unjust

muscle and pluck for ever
what invigorates life invigorates death,
and the dead advance as much as the living advance,
and the future is no more uncertain than the present,
and the roughness of the earth and of man encloses as
much as the delicatesse of the earth and of man,
and nothing endures but personal qualities
what do you think endures?
do you think the great city endures?
or a teeming manufacturing state? or a prepared constitution? or the best
built steamships?
or hotels of granite and iron? or any chefsdoeuvre of engineering,
forts, armaments?
away these are not to be cherished for themselves
they fill their hour, the dancers dance, the musicians play
for them
the show passes, all does well enough of course,
all does very well till one flash of defiance
the great city is that which has the greatest man or woman
if it be a few ragged huts, it is still the greatest city in the
whole world

the place where the great city stands is not the place of
stretched wharves, docks, manufactures, deposits of produce,
nor the place of ceaseless salutes of newcomers, or the
anchorlifters of the departing,
nor the place of the tallest and costliest buildings, or shops
selling goods from the rest of the earth,
nor the place of the best libraries and schoolsnor the place where money
is plentiest,
nor the place of the most numerous population
where the city stands with the brawniest breed of orators and bards
where the city stands that is beloved by these, and loves them in return,
and understands them
where no monuments exist to heroes but in the common words and deeds
where thrift is in its place, and prudence is in its place
where the men and women think lightly of the laws
where the slave ceases, and the master of slaves ceases
where the populace rise at once against the neverending audacity of
elected persons
where fierce men and women pour forth, as the sea to the whistle of death
pours its sweeping and unripped waves
where outside authority enters always after the precedence of inside
authority
where the citizen is always the head and idealand president, mayor,
governor, and what not, are agents for pay
where children are taught to be laws to themselves, and to depend on
themselves
where equanimity is illustrated in affairs
where speculations on the soul are encouraged
where women walk in public processions in the streets, the same as the men
where they enter the public assembly and take places the same as the men
where the city of the faithfullest friends stands
where the city of the cleanliness of the sexes stands
where the city of the healthiest fathers stands
where the city of the bestbodied mothers stands,
there the great city stands

how beggarly appear arguments before a defiant deed
how the floridness of the materials of cities shrivels before a mans or
womans look
all waits, or goes by default, till a strong being appears
a strong being is the proof of the race, and of the ability of the
universe
when he or she appears, materials are overawed,
the dispute on the soul stops,
the old customs and phrases are confronted, turned back, or laid away
what is your moneymaking now? what can it do now?
what is your respectability now?
what are your theology, tuition, society, traditions, statutebooks, now?
where are your jibes of being now?
where are your cavils about the soul now?
was that your best? were those your vast and solid?
riches, opinions, politics, institutions, to part obediently from the path
of one man or woman
the centuries, and all authority, to be trod under the footsoles of one
man or woman

a sterile landscape covers the orethere is as good as the best, for all
the forbidding appearance
there is the mine, there are the miners
the forgefurnace is there, the melt is accomplished the hammersmen are at
hand with their tongs and hammers
what always served and always serves is at hand
than this nothing has better servedit has served all
served the fluenttongued and subtlesensed greek, and long ere the greek
served in building the buildings that last longer than any
served the hebrew, the persian, the most ancient hindostanee
served the moundraiser on the mississippiserved those whose relics
remain in central america
served albic temples in woods or on plains, with unhewn pillars, and the
druids
served the artificial clefts, vast, high, silent, on the snowcovered hills
of scandinavia
served those who, time out of mind, made on the granite walls rough
sketches of the sun, moon, stars, ships, oceanwaves
served the paths of the irruptions of the gothsserved the pastoral tribes
and nomads
served the long long distant keltserved the hardy pirates of the baltic
served, before any of those, the venerable and harmless men of ethiopia
served the making of helms for the galleys of pleasure, and the making of
those for war
served all great works on land, and all great works on the sea
for the mediaeval ages, and before the mediaeval ages
served not the living only, then as now, but served the dead

i see the european headsman
he stands masked, clothed in red, with huge legs and strong naked arms,
and leans on a ponderous axe
whom have you slaughtered lately, european headsman?
whose is that blood upon you, so wet and sticky?
i see the clear sunsets of the martyrs
i see from the scaffolds the descending ghosts,
ghosts of dead lords, uncrowned ladies, impeached ministers, rejected
kings,
rivals, traitors, poisoners, disgraced chieftains, and the rest
i see those who in any land have died for the good cause
the seed is spare, nevertheless the crop shall never run out
mind you, o foreign kings, o priests, the crop shall never run out
i see the blood washed entirely away from the axe
both blade and helve are clean
they spirt no more the blood of european noblesthey clasp no more the
necks of queens
i see the headsman withdraw and become useless
i see the scaffold untrodden and mouldyi see no longer any axe upon it
i see the mighty and friendly emblem of the power of my own racethe
newest, largest race

america i do not vaunt my love for you
i have what i have

the shapes arise
shapes of the using of axes anyhow, and the users, and all that neighbours
them,
cuttersdown of wood, and haulers of it to the penobscot or kennebec,
dwellers in cabins among the californian mountains, or by the little lakes,
or on the columbia,
dwellers south on the banks of the gila or rio grandefriendly gatherings,
the characters and fun,
dwellers up north in minnesota and by the yellowstone riverdwellers on
coasts and off coasts,
sealfishers, whalers, arctic seamen breaking passages through the ice
the shapes arise
shapes of factories, arsenals, foundries, markets
shapes of the twothreaded tracks of railroads
shapes of the sleepers of bridges, vast frameworks, girders, arches
shapes of the fleets of barges, tows, lake craft, river craft
the shapes arise
shipyards and drydocks along the eastern and western seas, and in many a
bay and byplace,
the liveoak kelsons, the pineplanks, the spars, the hackmatackroots for
knees,
the ships themselves on their ways, the tiers of scaffolds, the workmen
busy outside and inside,
the tools lying around, the great auger and little auger, the adze, bolt,
line, square, gouge, and beadplane

the shapes arise
the shape measured, sawed, jacked, joined, stained,
the coffinshape for the dead to lie within in his shroud
the shape got out in posts, in the bedstead posts, in the posts of the
brides bed
the shape of the little trough, the shape of the rockers beneath, the shape
of the babes cradle
the shape of the floorplanks, the floorplanks for dancers feet
the shape of the planks of the family home, the home of the friendly
parents and children,

the shape of the stepladder for the convicted and sentenced murderer, the
murderer with haggard face and pinioned arms,
the sheriff at hand with his deputies, the silent and whitelipped crowd,
the sickening dangling of the rope
the shapes arise
shapes of doors giving many exits and entrances
the door passing the dissevered friend, flushed and in haste
the door that admits good news and bad news
the door whence the son left home, confident and puffed up
the door he entered again from a long and scandalous absence, diseased,
broken down, without innocence, without means

her shape arises,
she less guarded than ever, yet more guarded than ever
the gross and soiled she moves among do not make her gross and soiled
she knows the thoughts as she passesnothing is concealed from her
she is none the less considerate or friendly therefor

with all which, had it not been, i would not now be here, as i am
with egypt, india, phoenicia, greece, and rome
with the kelt, the scandinavian, the alb, and the saxon
with antique maritime ventures,with laws, artisanship, wars, and
journeys
with the poet, the skald, the saga, the myth, and the oracle
with the sale of slaveswith enthusiastswith the troubadour, the
crusader, and the monk
with those old continents whence we have come to this new continent
with the fading kingdoms and kings over there
with the fading religions and priests
with the small shores we look back to from our own large and present
shores
with countless years drawing themselves onward, and arrived at these years
you and me arrivedamerica arrived, and making this year
this year sending itself ahead countless years to come

we are the skald, the oracle, the monk, and the knightwe easily include
them, and more
we stand amid time, beginningless and endlesswe stand amid evil and good

the very sun swings itself and its system of planets around us

i believe materialism is true, and spiritualism is truei reject no part
have i forgotten any part?
come to me, whoever and whatever, till i give you recognition
i respect assyria, china, teutonia, and the hebrews
i adopt each theory, myth, god, and demigod
i see that the old accounts, bibles, genealogies, are true, without
exception
i assert that all past days were what they should have been
and that they could nohow have been better than they were,
and that today is what it should beand that america is,
and that today and america could nohow be better than they are

a broadway pageant
reception of the japanese embassy, june ,

over sea, hither from niphon,
courteous, the princes of asia, swartcheeked princes,
firstcomers, guests, twosworded princes,
lessongiving princes, leaning back in their open barouches, bareheaded,
impassive,
this day they ride through manhattan

libertad
i do not know whether others behold what i behold,
in the procession, along with the princes of asia, the errandbearers,
bringing up the rear, hovering above, around, or in the ranks marching
but i will sing you a song of what i behold, libertad

when millionfooted manhattan, unpent, descends to its pavements
when the thundercracking guns arouse me with the proud roar i love
when the roundmouthed guns, out of the smoke and smell i love, spit their
salutes
when the fireflashing guns have fully alerted mewhen heavenclouds
canopy my city with a delicate thin haze
when, gorgeous, the countless straight stems, the forests at the wharves,
thicken with colours
when every ship, richly dressed, carries her flag at the peak
when pennants trail, and streetfestoons hang from the windows
when broadway is entirely given up to footpassengers and footstanders
when the mass is densest
when the faades of the houses are alive with peoplewhen eyes gaze,
riveted, tens of thousands at a time
when the guests from the islands advancewhen the pageant moves forward,
visible
when the summons is madewhen the answer, that waited thousands of years,
answers
i too, arising, answering, descend to the pavements, merge with the crowd,
and gaze with them

superbfaced manhattan

the land of paradiseland of the caucasusthe nest of birth,
the nest of languages, the bequeather of poems, the race of eld,
florid with blood, pensive, rapt with musings, hot with passion,
sultry with perfume, with ample and flowing garments,
with sunburnt visage, with intense soul and glittering eyes,
the race of brahma comes

as it moves changing, a kaleidoscope divine it moves changing before us

archipelagoes to you
bend your proud neck for once, young libertad

were the children straying westward so long? so wide the tramping?
were the precedent dim ages debouching westward from paradise so long?
were the centuries steadily footing it that way, all the while unknown, for
you, for reasons?
they are justifiedthey are accomplishedthey shall now be turned the
other way also, to travel toward you thence
they shall now also march obediently eastward, for your sake, libertad
old ireland

far hence, amid an isle of wondrous beauty,
crouching over a grave, an ancient sorrowful mother,
once a queennow lean and tattered, seated on the ground,
her old white hair drooping dishevelled round her shoulders
at her feet fallen an unused royal harp,
long silentshe too long silentmourning her shrouded hope and heir
of all the earth her heart most full of sorrow, because most full of love

yet a word, ancient mother
you need crouch there no longer on the cold ground, with forehead between
your knees
o you need not sit there, veiled in your old white hair, so dishevelled
for know you, the one you mourn is not in that grave
it was an illusionthe heir, the son you love, was not really dead
the lord is not deadhe is risen again, young and strong, in another
country
even while you wept there by your fallen harp, by the grave,
what you wept for was translated, passed from the grave,
the winds favoured, and the sea sailed it,
and now, with rosy and new blood,
moves today in a new country
boston town

to get betimes in boston town, i rose this morning early
heres a good place at the corneri must stand and see the show

clear the way there, jonathan
way for the presidents marshal way for the government cannon
way for the federal foot and dragoonsand the apparitions copiously
tumbling
i love to look on the stars and stripesi hope the fifes will play yankee
doodle,
how bright shine the cutlasses of the foremost troops
every man holds his revolver, marching stiff through boston town

a fog followsantiques of the same come limping,
some appear woodenlegged, and some appear bandaged and bloodless
why this is indeed a show it has called the dead out of the earth
the old graveyards of the hills have hurried to see
phantoms phantoms countless by flank and rear
cocked hats of mothy mould crutches made of mist
arms in slings old men leaning on young mens shoulders
what troubles you, yankee phantoms? what is all this chattering of bare
gums?
does the ague convulse your limbs? do you mistake your crutches for
firelocks, and level them?
if you blind your eyes with tears, you will not see the presidents
marshal
if you groan such groans, you might baulk the government cannon
for shame, old maniacs bring down those tossed arms, and let your white
hair be
here gape your great grandsonstheir wives gaze at them from the windows,
see how welldressedsee how orderly they conduct themselves
worse and worse cant you stand it? are you retreating?
is this hour with the living too dead for you?
retreat then pellmell
to your graves back back to the hills, old limpers
i do not think you belong here, anyhow

but there is one thing that belongs hereshall i tell you what it is,
gentlemen of boston?
i will whisper it to the mayorhe shall send a committee to england
they shall get a grant from the parliament, go with a cart to the royal
vaulthaste
dig out king georges coffin, unwrap him quick from the graveclothes, box
up his bones for a journey
find a swift yankee clipperhere is freight for you, blackbellied
clipper,
up with your anchor shake out your sails steer straight toward boston
bay

now call for the presidents marshal again, bring out the government
cannon,
fetch home the roarers from congress,make another procession, guard it
with foot and dragoons
this centrepiece for them
look, all orderly citizens look from the windows, women
the committee open the box set up the regal ribs glue those that will not
stay
clap the skull on top of the ribs, and clap a crown on top of the skull
you have got your revenge, old bluster the crown is come to its own, and
more than its own

stick your hands in your pockets, jonathanyou are a made man from this
day
you are mighty cuteand here is one of your bargains
france, the eighteenth year of these states

a great year and place
a harsh, discordant, natal scream outsounding, to touch the mothers heart
closer than any yet

i walked the shores of my eastern sea,
heard over the waves the little voice,
saw the divine infant, where she woke, mournfully wailing, amid the roar of
cannon, curses, shouts, crash of falling buildings
was not so sick from the blood in the gutters runningnor from the single
corpses, nor those in heaps, nor those borne away in the tumbrils
was not so desperate at the battues of deathwas not so shocked at the
repeated fusillades of the guns
pale, silent, stern, what could i say to that longaccrued retribution?
could i wish humanity different?
could i wish the people made of wood and stone?
or that there be no justice in destiny or time?

o liberty o mate for me
here too the blaze, the bullet, and the axe, in reserve to fetch them out
in case of need,
here too, though long repressed, can never be destroyed
here too could rise at last, murdering and ecstatic
here too demanding full arrears of vengeance
hence i sign this salute over the sea,
and i do not deny that terrible red birth and baptism,
but remember the little voice that i heard wailingand wait with perfect
trust, no matter how long
and from today, sad and cogent, i maintain the bequeathed cause, as for
all lands,
and i send these words to paris with my love,
and i guess some chansonniers there will understand them,
for i guess there is latent music yet in francefloods of it
o i hear already the bustle of instrumentsthey will soon be drowning all
that would interrupt them
o i think the east wind brings a triumphal and free march,
it reaches hitherit swells me to joyful madness,
i will run transpose it in words, to justify it,
i will yet sing a song for you, ma femme
footnote  the great poet of democracy is not so shocked at
the great european year of democracy
europe, the seventysecond and seventythird years of these states

suddenly, out of its stale and drowsy lair, the lair of slaves,
like lightning it leaped forth, half startled at itself,
its feet upon the ashes and the ragsits hands tight to the throats of
kings
o hope and faith
o aching close of exiled patriots lives
o many a sickened heart
turn back unto this day, and make yourselves afresh

and you, paid to defile the people you liars, mark
not for numberless agonies, murders, lusts,
for court thieving in its manifold mean forms, worming from his simplicity
the poor mans wages,
for many a promise sworn by royal lips, and broken, and laughed at in the
breaking,
then in their power, not for all these did the blows strike revenge, or the
heads of the nobles fall
the people scorned the ferocity of kings

but the sweetness of mercy brewed bitter destruction, and the frightened
rulers come back
each comes in state with his trainhangman, priest, taxgatherer,
soldier, lawyer, lord, jailer, and sycophant

yet behind all, lowering, stealinglo, a shape,
vague as the night, draped interminably, head, front, and form, in scarlet
folds,
whose face and eyes none may see
out of its robes only thisthe red robes, lifted by the arm
one finger crooked, pointed high over the top, like the head of a snake
appears

meanwhile, corpses lie in newmade gravesbloody corpses of young men
the rope of the gibbet hangs heavily, the bullets of princes are flying,
the creatures of power laugh aloud,
and all these things bear fruitsand they are good
those corpses of young men,
those martyrs that hang from the gibbetsthose hearts pierced by the grey
lead,
cold and motionless as they seem, live elsewhere with unslaughtered
vitality
they live in other young men, o kings
they live in brothers, again ready to defy you
they were purified by deaththey were taught and exalted
not a grave of the murdered for freedom but grows seed for freedom, in its
turn to bear seed,
which the winds carry afar and resow, and the rains and the snows nourish
not a disembodied spirit can the weapons of tyrants let loose,
but it stalks invisibly over the earth, whispering, counselling,
cautioning

liberty let others despair of you i never despair of you
is the house shut? is the master away?
nevertheless, be readybe not weary of watching

footnote  the years  and
to a foiled revolter or revoltress

courage my brother or my sister
keep on liberty is to be subserved, whatever occurs
that is nothing that is quelled by one or two failures, or any number of
failures,
or by the indifference or ingratitude of the people, or by any
unfaithfulness,
or the show of the tushes of power, soldiers, cannon, penal statutes

what we believe in waits latent for ever through all the continents, and
all the islands and archipelagoes of the sea
what we believe in invites no one, promises nothing, sits in calmness and
light, is positive and composed, knows no discouragement,
waiting patiently, waiting its time

the battle rages with many a loud alarm, and frequent advance and retreat,
the infidel triumphsor supposes he triumphs,
the prison, scaffold, garrote, handcuffs, iron necklace and anklet, lead
balls, do their work,
the named and unnamed heroes pass to other spheres,
the great speakers and writers are exiledthey lie sick in distant lands,
the cause is asleepthe strongest throats are still, choked
with their own blood,
the young men drop their eyelashes toward the ground when they meet
but, for all this, liberty has not gone out of the place, nor the infidel
entered into possession
when liberty goes out of a place, it is not the first to go, nor the second
or third to go,
it waits for all the rest to goit is the last
when there are no more memories of heroes and martyrs,
and when all life and all the souls of men and women are discharged from
any part of the earth,
then only shall liberty be discharged from that part of the earth,
and the infidel and the tyrant come into possession

then courage revolter revoltress
for till all ceases neither must you cease

i do not know what you are for, i do not know what i am for myself, nor
what anything is for,
but i will search carefully for it even in being foiled,
in defeat, poverty, imprisonmentfor they too are great
did we think victory great?
so it isbut now it seems to me, when it cannot be helped, that defeat is
great,
and that death and dismay are great

o strongest you in the hour of danger, in crisis o truer than steel
how you sprang how you threw off the costumes of peace with indifferent

how your soft operamusic changed, and the drum and fife were heard in

old matron of the city this proud, friendly, turbulent city
often in peace and wealth you were pensive, or covertly frowned amid all
your children
but now you smile with joy, exulting old mannahatta

armed year year of the struggle
no dainty rhymes or sentimental love verses for you, terrible year
not you as some pale poetling, seated at a desk, lisping cadenzas piano
but as a strong man, erect, clothed in blue clothes, advancing, carrying a
rifle on your shoulder,
with wellgristled body and sunburnt face and handswith a knife in the
belt at your side,
as i heard you shouting loudyour sonorous voice ringing across the
continent
your masculine voice, o year, as rising amid the great cities,
amid the men of manhattan i saw you, as one of the workmen, the dwellers in
manhattan
or with large steps crossing the prairies out of illinois and indiana,
rapidly crossing the west with springy gait, and descending the
alleghanies
or down from the great lakes, or in pennsylvania, or on deck along the ohio
river
or southward along the tennessee or cumberland rivers, or at chattanooga on
the mountaintop,
saw i your gait and saw i your sinewy limbs, clothed in blue, bearing
weapons, robust year
heard your determined voice, launched forth again and again
year that suddenly sang by the mouths of the roundlipped cannon,
i repeat you, hurrying, crashing, sad, distracted year
the uprising

rise, o days, from your fathomless deeps, till you loftier and fiercer
sweep
long for my soul, hungering gymnastic, i devoured what the earth gave me
long i roamed the woods of the northlong i watched niagara pouring
i travelled the prairies over, and slept on their breasti crossed the
nevadas,
i crossed the plateaus
i ascended the towering rocks along the pacific, i sailed out to sea
i sailed through the storm, i was refreshed by the storm
i watched with joy the threatening maws of the waves
i marked the white combs where they careered so high, curling over
i heard the wind piping, i saw the black clouds
saw from below what arose and mounted, o superb o wild as my heart, and
powerful
heard the continuous thunder, as it bellowed after the lightning
noted the slender and jagged threads of lightning, as sudden and fast amid
the din they chased each other across the sky
these, and such as these, i, elate, sawsaw with wonder, yet pensive and
masterful
all the menacing might of the globe uprisen around me
yet there with my soul i fedi fed content, supercilious

twas well, o soul twas a good preparation you gave me
now we advance our latent and ampler hunger to fill
now we go forth to receive what the earth and the sea never gave us
not through the mighty woods we go, but through the mightier cities
something for us is pouring now, more than niagara pouring
torrents of men, sources and rills of the northwest, are you indeed
inexhaustible?
what, to pavements and homesteads herewhat were those storms of the
mountains and sea?
what, to passions i witness around me today, was the sea risen?
was the wind piping the pipe of death under the black clouds?
lo from deeps more unfathomable, something more deadly and savage
manhattan, rising, advancing with menacing frontcincinnati, chicago,
unchained
what was that swell i saw on the ocean? behold what comes here
how it climbs with daring feet and hands how it dashes
how the true thunder bellows after the lightning how bright the flashes of
lightning
how democracy with desperate vengeful port strides on, shown through the
dark by those flashes of lightning
yet a mournful wail and low sob i fancied i heard through the dark,
in a lull of the deafening confusion

thunder on stride on, democracy strike with vengeful stroke
and do you rise higher than ever yet, o days, o cities
crash heavier, heavier yet, o storms you have done me good
my soul, prepared in the mountains, absorbs your immortal strong nutriment
long had i walked my cities, my country roads, through farms, only half
satisfied
one doubt, nauseous, undulating like a snake, crawled on the ground before
me,
continually preceding my steps, turning upon me oft, ironically hissing
low
the cities i loved so well i abandoned and lefti sped to the
certainties suitable to me
hungering, hungering, hungering, for primal energies, and natures
dauntlessness,
i refreshed myself with it only, i could relish it only
i waited the bursting forth of the pent fireon the water and air i waited
long
but now i no longer waiti am fully satisfiedi am glutted
i have witnessed the true lightningi have witnessed my cities electric
i have lived to behold man burst forth, and warlike america rise
hence i will seek no more the food of the northern solitary wilds,
no more on the mountains roam, or sail the stormy sea

song of the banner at daybreak
poet
o a new song, a free song,
flapping, flapping, flapping, flapping, by sounds, by voices clearer,
by the winds voice and that of the drum,
by the banners voice, and childs voice, and seas voice, and fathers
voice,
low on the ground and high in the air,
on the ground where father and child stand,
in the upward air where their eyes turn,
where the banner at daybreak is flapping
words bookwords what are you?
words no more, for hearken and see,
my song is there in the open airand i must sing,
with the banner and pennant aflapping
ill weave the chord and twine in,
mans desire and babes desireill twine them in, ill put in life
ill put the bayonets flashing pointill let bullets and slugs whizz
ill pour the verse with streams of blood, full of volition, full of joy
then loosen, launch forth, to go and compete,
with the banner and pennant aflapping
banner and pennant
come up here, bard, bard
come up here, soul, soul
come up here, dear little child,
to fly in the clouds and winds with us, and play with the measureless
light
child
father, what is that in the sky beckoning to me with long finger?
and what does it say to me all the while?
father
nothing, my babe, you see in the sky
and nothing at all to you it says but look you, my babe,
look at these dazzling things in the houses, and see you the moneyshops
opening
and see you the vehicles preparing to crawl along the streets with goods
these ah, these how valued and toiled for, these
how envied by all the earth
poet
fresh and rosy red, the sun is mounting high
on floats the sea in distant blue, careering through its channels
on floats the wind over the breast of the sea, setting in toward land
the great steady wind from west and westbysouth,
floating so buoyant, with milkwhite foam on the waters
but i am not the sea, nor the red sun
i am not the wind, with girlish laughter
not the immense wind which strengthensnot the wind which lashes
not the spirit that ever lashes its own body to terror and death
but i am of that which unseen comes and sings, sings, sings,
which babbles in brooks and scoots in showers on the land
which the birds know in the woods, mornings and evenings,
and the shoresands know, and the hissing wave, and that banner and
pennant,
aloft there flapping and flapping
child
o father, it is aliveit is full of peopleit has children
o now it seems to me it is talking to its children
i hear itit talks to meo it is wonderful
o it stretchesit spreads and runs so fast o my father,
it is so broad it covers the whole sky
father
cease, cease, my foolish babe,
what you are saying is sorrowful to memuch it displeases me
behold with the rest, again i saybehold not banners and pennants aloft
but the wellprepared pavements beholdand mark the solidwalled houses
banner and pennant
speak to the child, o bard, out of manhattan
speak to our children all, or north or south of manhattan,
where our factoryengines hum, where our miners delve the ground,
where our hoarse niagara rumbles, where our prairieploughs are ploughing
speak, o bard point this day, leaving all the rest, to us over alland
yet we know not why
for what are we, mere strips of cloth, profiting nothing,
only flapping in the wind?
poet
i hear and see not strips of cloth alone
i hear the tramp of armies, i hear the challenging sentry
i hear the jubilant shouts of millions of meni hear liberty
i hear the drums beat, and the trumpets blowing
i myself move abroad, swiftrising, flying then
i use the wings of the landbird, and use the wings of the seabird, and
look down as from a height
i do not deny the precious results of peacei see populous cities, with
wealth incalculable
i see numberless farmsi see the farmers working in their fields or barns
i see mechanics workingi see buildings everywhere founded, going up, or
finished
i see trains of cars swiftly speeding along railroad tracks, drawn by the
locomotives
i see the stores, depots, of boston, baltimore, charleston, new orleans
i see far in the west the immense area of graini dwell a while, hovering
i pass to the lumber forests of the north, and again to the southern
plantation, and again to california
sweeping the whole, i see the countless profit, the busy gatherings, earned
wages
see the identity formed out of thirtysix spacious and haughty states, and
many more to come
see forts on the shores of harbourssee ships sailing in and out
then over all, aye aye my little and lengthened pennant shaped like a
sword
runs swiftly up, indicating war and defianceand now the halyards have
raised it,
side of my banner broad and blueside of my starry banner,
discarding peace over all the sea and land
banner and pennant
yet louder, higher, stronger, bard yet farther, wider cleave
no longer let our children deem us riches and peace alone
we can be terror and carnage also, and are so now
not now are we one of these spacious and haughty states, nor any five, nor
ten
nor market nor depot are we, nor moneybank in the city
but these, and all, and the brown and spreading land, and the mines below,
are ours
and the shores of the sea are ours, and the rivers great and small
and the fields they moisten are ours, and the crops, and the fruits are
ours
bays and channels, and ships sailing in and out, are oursand we over all,
over the area spread below, the three millions of square milesthe
capitals,
the thirtyfive millions of peopleo bard in life and death supreme,
we, even we, from this day flaunt out masterful, high up above,
not for the present alone, for a thousand years, chanting through you
this song to the soul of one poor little child
child
o my father, i like not the houses
they will never to me be anythingnor do i like money
but to mount up there i would like, o father dearthat banner i like
that pennant i would be, and must be
father
child of mine, you fill me with anguish,
to be that pennant would be too fearful
little you know what it is this day, and henceforth for ever
it is to gain nothing, but risk and defy everything
forward to stand in front of warsand o, such warswhat have you to do
with them?
with passions of demons, slaughter, premature death?
poet
demons and death then i sing
put in all, aye all, will iswordshaped pennant for war, and banner so
broad and blue,
and a pleasure new and ecstatic, and the prattled yearning of children,
blent with the sounds of the peaceful land, and the liquid wash of the sea
and the icy cool of the far, far north, with rustling cedars and pines
and the whirr of drums, and the sound of soldiers marching, and the hot sun
shining south
and the beachwaves combing over the beach on my eastern shore, and my
western shore the same
and all between those shores, and my everrunning mississippi, with bends
and chutes
and my illinois fields, and my kansas fields, and my fields of missouri
the continentdevoting the whole identity, without reserving an atom,
pour in whelm that which asks, which sings, with all, and the yield of
all
banner and pennant
aye all for ever, for all
from sea to sea, north and south, east and west,
fusing and holding, claiming, devouring the whole
no more with tender lip, nor musical labial sound,
but out of the night emerging for good, our voice persuasive no more,
croaking like crows here in the wind
poet
my limbs, my veins dilate
the blood of the world has filled me fullmy theme is clear at last
banner so broad, advancing out of the night, i sing you haughty and
resolute
i burst through where i waited long, too long, deafened and blinded
my sight, my hearing and tongue, are come to me, a little child taught
me
i hear from above, o pennant of war, your ironical call and demand
insensate insensate yet i at any rate chant you, o banner
not houses of peace are you, nor any nor all their prosperity if need be,
you shall have every one of those houses to destroy them
you thought not to destroy those valuable houses, standing fast, full of
comfort, built with money
may they stand fast, then? not an hour, unless you, above them and all,
stand fast
o banner not money so precious are you, nor farm produce you, nor the
material good nutriment,
nor excellent stores, nor landed on wharves from the ships
not the superb ships, with sailpower or steampower, fetching and carrying
cargoes,
nor machinery, vehicles, trade, nor revenues,but you, as henceforth i see
you,
running up out of the night, bringing your cluster of stars, everenlarging
stars
divider of daybreak you, cutting the air, touched by the sun, measuring the
sky,
passionately seen and yearned for by one poor little child,
while others remain busy, or smartly talking, for ever teaching thrift,
thrift
o you up there o pennant where you undulate like a snake, hissing so
curious,
out of reachan idea onlyyet furiously fought for, risking bloody
deathloved by me
so loved o you banner, leading the day, with stars brought from the night
valueless, object of eyes, over all and demanding allo banner and
pennant
i too leave the restgreat as it is, it is nothinghouses, machines are
nothingi see them not
i see but you, o warlike pennant o banner so broad, with stripes, i sing
you only,
flapping up there in the wind
the bivouacs flame
by the bivouacs fitful flame,
a procession winding around me, solemn and sweet and slowbut first i
note
the tents of the sleeping army, the fields and woods dim outline,
the darkness, lit by spots of kindled firethe silence
like a phantom far or near an occasional figure moving
the shrubs and trees, as i lift my eyes they seem to be stealthily
watching me
while wind in procession thoughts, o tender and wondrous thoughts,
of life and deathof home and the past and loved, and of those that are
far away
a solemn and slow procession there as i sit on the ground,
by the bivouacs fitful flame
bivouac on a mountainside
i see before me now a travelling army halting
below, a fertile valley spread, with barns, and the orchards of summer
behind, the terraced sides of a mountain, abrupt in places, rising high
broken with rocks, with clinging cedars, with tall shapes, dingily seen
the numerous campfires scattered near and far, some away up on the
mountain
the shadowy forms of men and horses, looming, largesized, flickering
and over all, the skythe sky far, far out of reach, studded with the
eternal stars
city of ships
city of ships
o the black ships o the fierce ships
o the beautiful, sharpbowed steamships and sailships
city of the world for all races are here
all the lands of the earth make contributions here
city of the sea city of hurried and glittering tides
city whose gleeful tides continually rush or recede, whirling in and out,
with eddies and foam
city of wharves and stores city of tall faades of marble and iron
proud and passionate city mettlesome, mad, extravagant city
spring up, o city not for peace alone, but be indeed yourself, warlike
fear not submit to no models but your own, o city
behold me incarnate me, as i have incarnated you
i have rejected nothing you offered mewhom you adopted, i have adopted
good or bad, i never question youi love alli do not condemn anything
i chant and celebrate all that is yoursyet peace no more
in peace i chanted peace, but now the drum of war is mine
war, red war, is my song through your streets, o city
vigil on the field
vigil strange i kept on the field one night,
when you, my son and my comrade, dropped at my side that day
one look i but gave, which your dear eyes returned with a look i shall
never forget
one touch of your hand to mine, o boy, reached up as you lay on the ground
then onward i sped in the battle, the evencontested battle
till, late in the night relieved, to the place at last again i made my way
found you in death so cold, dear comradefound your body, son of
responding kisses, never again on earth responding
bared your face in the starlightcurious the scenecool blew the moderate
nightwind
long there and then in vigil i stood, dimly around me the battlefield
spreading
vigil wondrous and vigil sweet, there in the fragrant silent night
but not a tear fell, not even a longdrawn sighlong, long i gazed
then on the earth partially reclining, sat by your side, leaning my chin in
my hands
passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours, with you, dearest comrade
not a tear, not a word
vigil of silence, love, and deathvigil for you, my son and my soldier,
as onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones upward stole
vigil final for you, brave boy, i could not save you, swift was your
death,
i faithfully loved you and cared for you livingi think we shall surely
meet again
till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the dawn appeared,
my comrade i wrapped in his blanket, enveloped well his form,
folded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head, and carefully
under feet
and there and then, and bathed by the rising sun, my son in his grave, in
his rudedug grave, i deposited
ending my vigil strange with thatvigil of night and battlefield dim
vigil for boy of responding kisses, never again on earth responding
vigil for comrade swiftly slain, vigil i never forgethow as day
brightened
i rose from the chill ground, and folded my soldier well in his blanket,
and buried him where he fell
the flag
bathed in wars perfumedelicate flag
o to hear you call the sailors and the soldiers flag like a beautiful
woman
o to hear the tramp, tramp, of a million answering men o the ships they
arm with joy
o to see you leap and beckon from the tall masts of ships
o to see you peering down on the sailors on the decks
flag like the eyes of women
the wounded
a march in the ranks hardpressed, and the road unknown
a route through a heavy wood, with muffled steps in the darkness
our army foiled with loss severe, and the sullen remnant retreating
till after midnight glimmer upon us the lights of a dimlighted building
we come to an open space in the woods, and halt by the dimlighted
building
tis a large old church, at the crossing roadstis now an impromptu
hospital
entering but for a minute, i see a sight beyond all the pictures and
poems ever made
shadows of deepest, deepest black, just lit by moving, candles and lamps,
and by one great pitchy torch, stationary, with wild red flame, and clouds
of smoke
by these, crowds, groups of forms, vaguely i see, on the floor, some in the
pews laid down
at my feet more distinctly, a soldier, a mere lad, in danger of bleeding to
death, he is shot in the abdomen
i staunch the blood temporarily, the youngsters face is white as a lily
then before i depart i sweep my eyes oer the scene, fain to absorb it all
faces, varieties, postures, beyond description, most in obscurity, some of
them dead
surgeons operating, attendants holding lights, the smell of ether, the
odour of blood
the crowd, o the crowd of the bloody forms of soldiersthe yard outside
also filled
some on the bare ground, some on planks or stretchers, some in the death
spasm sweating
an occasional scream or cry, the doctors shouted orders or calls
the glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of the
torches
these i resume as i chanti see again the forms, i smell the odour
then hear outside the orders given, fall in, my men, fall in
but first i bend to the dying ladhis eyes opena halfsmile gives he me
then the eyes close, calmly close and i speed forth to the darkness,
resuming, marching, as ever in darkness marching, on in the ranks,
the unknown road still marching
a sight in camp

a sight in camp in the daybreak grey and dim,
as from my tent i emerge so early, sleepless,
as slow i walk in the cool fresh air the path near by the hospital tent,
three forms i see on stretchers lying, brought out there, untended lying
over each the blanket spread, ample brownish woollen blanket,
grey and heavy blanket, folding, covering all

curious, i halt, and silent stand
then with light fingers i from the face of the nearest, the first, just
lift the blanket
who are you, elderly man, so gaunt and grim, with wellgreyed hair, and
flesh all sunken about the eyes?
who are you, my dear comrade?
then to the second i stepand who are you, my child and darling?
who are you, sweet boy, with cheeks yet blooming?
then to the thirda face nor child nor old, very calm, as of beautiful
yellowwhite ivory
young man, i think i know youi think this face of yours is the face of
the christ himself
dead and divine and brother of all, and here again he lies
a grave

as toilsome i wandered virginias woods,
to the music of rustling leaves kicked by my feetfor twas autumn
i marked at the foot of a tree the grave of a soldier
mortally wounded he, and buried on the retreateasily all could i
understand
the halt of a midday hourwhen, up no time to lose yet this sign left
on a tablet scrawled and nailed on the tree by the grave,
bold, cautious, true, and my loving comrade

long, long i muse,then on my way go wandering,
many a changeful season to follow, and many a scene of life
yet at times through changeful season and scene, abrupt,alone, or in the
crowded street,
comes before me the unknown soldiers grave, comes the inscription rude in
virginias woods,
bold, cautious, true, and my loving comrade
the dresser

an old man bending, i come among new faces,
years, looking backward, resuming, in answer to children,
come tell us, old man, as from young men and maidens that love me, years
hence of these scenes, of these furious passions, these chances,
of unsurpassed heroeswas one side so brave? the other was equally brave
now be witness againpaint the mightiest armies of earth
of those armies, so rapid, so wondrous, what saw you to tell us?
what stays with you latest and deepest? of curious panics,
of hardfought engagements, or sieges tremendous, what deepest remains?

o maidens and young men i love, and that love me,
what you ask of my days, those the strangest and sudden your talking
recalls,
soldier alert i arrive, after a long march, covered with sweat and dust
in the nick of time i come, plunge in the fight, loudly shout in the rush
of successful charge
enter the captured works,yet lo like a swiftrunning river, they fade,
pass, and are gone they fadei dwell not on soldiers perils or soldiers
joys
both i remember wellmany the hardships, few the joys, yet i was
content
but in silence, in dreams projections,
while the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on,
so soon what is over forgotten, and waves wash the imprints off the sand,
in natures reverie sad, with hinged knees returning, i enter the
doorswhile for you up there, whoever you are, follow me without
noise, and be of strong heart
bearing the bandages, water, and sponge,
straight and swift to my wounded i go,
where they lie on the ground, after the battle brought in
where their priceless blood reddens the grass, the ground
or to the rows of the hospital tent, or under the roofed hospital
to the long rows of cots, up and down, each side, i return
to each and all, one after another, i draw nearnot one do i miss
an attendant follows, holding a trayhe carries a refusepail,
soon to be filled with clotted rags and blood, emptied, and filled again
i onward go, i stop,
with hinged knees and steady hand, to dress wounds
i am firm with eachthe pangs are sharp, yet unavoidable
one turns to me his appealing eyespoor boy i never knew you,
yet i think i could not refuse this moment to die for you if that would
save you
on, on i goopen, doors of time open, hospital doors
the crushed head i dress poor crazed hand, tear not the bandage away
the neck of the cavalryman, with the bullet through and through, i
examine
hard the breathing rattles, quite glazed already the eye, yet life
struggles hard
come, sweet death be persuaded, o beautiful death
in mercy come quickly
from the stump of the arm, the amputated hand,
i undo the clotted lint, remove the slough, wash off the matter and blood
back on his pillow the soldier bends, with curved neck, and sidefalling
head
his eyes are closed, his face is pale, he dares not look on the bloody
stump,
and has not yet looked on it
i dress a wound in the side, deep, deep
but a day or two morefor see, the frame all wasted and sinking,
and the yellowblue countenance see
i dress the perforated shoulder, the foot with the bullet wound,
cleanse the one with a gnawing and putrid gangrene, so sickening, so
offensive,
while the attendant stands behind aside me, holding the tray and pail
i am faithful, i do not give out
the fractured thigh, the knee, the wound in the abdomen,
these and more i dress with impassive handyet deep in my breast a fire, a
burning flame

thus in silence, in dreams projections,
returning, resuming, i thread my way through the hospitals
the hurt and the wounded i pacify with soothing hand,
i sit by the restless all the dark nightsome are so young,
some suffer so muchi recall the experience sweet and sad
many a soldiers loving arms about this neck have crossed and rested,
many a soldiers kiss dwells on these bearded lips
a letter from camp

come up from the fields, father, heres a letter from our pete
and come to the front door, motherheres a letter from thy dear son

lo, tis autumn
lo, where the trees, deeper green, yellower and redder,
cool and sweeten ohios villages, with leaves fluttering in the moderate
wind
where apples ripe in the orchards hang, and grapes on the trellised vines
smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines?
smell you the buckwheat, where the bees were lately buzzing?
above all, lo, the sky, so calm, so transparent after the rain, and with
wondrous clouds
below, too, all calm, all vital and beautifuland the farm prospers well

down in the fields all prospers well
but now from the fields come, fathercome at the daughters call
and come to the entry, motherto the front door come, right away
fast as she can she hurriessomething ominousher steps trembling
she does not tarry to smooth her white hair, nor adjust her cap

open the envelope quickly
o this is not our sons writing, yet his name is signed
o a strange hand writes for our dear sono stricken mothers soul
all swims before her eyesflashes with blackshe catches the main words
only
sentences brokengunshot wound in the breast, cavalry skirmish, taken
to hospital,
at present low, but will soon be better

ah, now the single figure to me,
amid all teeming and wealthy ohio, with all its cities and farms,
sickly white in the face and dull in the head, very faint,
by the jamb of a door leans

grieve not so, dear mother, the justgrown daughter speaks through her
sobs
the little sisters huddle around, speechless and dismayed
see, dearest mother, the letter says pete will soon be better

alas poor boy, he will never be better, nor maybe needs to be better,
that brave and simple soul
while they stand at home at the door, he is dead already
the only son is dead
but the mother needs to be better
she, with thin form, presently dressed in black
by day her meals untouchedthen at night fitfully sleeping, often waking,
in the midnight waking, weeping, longing with one deep longing,
o that she might withdraw unnoticedsilent from life escape and withdraw,
to follow, to seek, to be with her dear dead son
war dreams

in clouds descending, in midnight sleep, of many a face in battle,
of the look at first of the mortally wounded, of that indescribable look,
of the dead on their backs, with arms extended wide
i dream, i dream, i dream

of scenes of nature, the fields and the mountains,
of the skies so beauteous after the storm, and at night the
moon so unearthly bright,
shining sweetly, shining down, where we dig the trenches,
and gather the heaps
i dream, i dream, i dream

long have they passed, long lapsedfaces, and trenches, and fields
long through the carnage i moved with a callous composure, or away from the
fallen
onward i sped at the time but now of their faces and forms, at night,
i dream, i dream, i dream
the veterans vision
while my wife at my side lies slumbering, and the wars are over long,
and my head on the pillow rests at home, and the mystic midnight passes,
and through the stillness, through the dark, i hear, just hear, the breath
of my infant,
there in the room, as i wake from sleep, this vision presses upon me
the engagement opens there and then, in my busy brain unreal
the skirmishers beginthey crawl cautiously aheadi hear the irregular
snap snap
i hear the sound of the different missilesthe short tht tht of
the rifleballs
i see the shells exploding, leaving small white cloudsi hear the great
shells shrieking as they pass
the grape, like the hum and whirr of wind through the trees, quick,
tumultuous, now the contest rages
all the scenes at the batteries themselves rise in detail before me again
the crashing and smokingthe pride of the men in their pieces
the chief gunner ranges and sights his piece, and selects a fuse of the
right time
after firing, i see him lean aside, and look eagerly off to note the
effect
elsewhere i hear the cry of a regiment chargingthe young colonel leads
himself this time, with brandished sword
i see the gaps cut by the enemys volleys, quickly filled upno delay
i breathe the suffocating smokethen the flat clouds hover low, concealing
all
now a strange lull comes for a few seconds, not a shot fired on either
side
then resumed, the chaos louder than ever, with eager calls, and orders of
officers
while from some distant part of the field the wind wafts to my ears a shout
of applause, some special success
and ever the sound of the cannon, far or near, rousing, even in dreams, a
devilish exultation, and all the old mad joy, in the depths of my
soul
and ever the hastening of infantry shifting positionsbatteries, cavalry,
moving hither and thither
the falling, dying, i heed notthe wounded, dripping and red, i heed not
some to the rear are hobbling
grime, heat, rushaidesdecamp galloping by, or on a full run
with the patter of small arms, the warning sst of the rifles, these in
my vision i hear or see,
and bombs bursting in air, and at night the varicoloured rockets
o tanfaced prairie boy
o tanfaced prairie boy
before you came to camp came many a welcome gift
praises and presents came, and nourishing foodtill at last, among the
recruits,
you came, taciturn, with nothing to givewe but looked on each other,
when lo more than all the gifts of the world you gave me
manhattan faces

give me the splendid silent sun, with all his beams fulldazzling
give me juicy autumnal fruit, ripe and red from the orchard
give me a field where the unmowed grass grows
give me an arbour, give me the trellised grape
give me fresh corn and wheatgive me serenemoving animals, teaching
content
give me nights perfectly quiet, as on high plateaus west of the
mississippi, and i looking up at the stars
give me odorous at sunrise a garden of beautiful flowers, where i can walk
undisturbed
give me for marriage a sweetbreathed woman, of whom i should never tire
give me a perfect childgive me, away, aside from the noise of the world,
a rural domestic life
give me to warble spontaneous songs, relieved, recluse by myself, for my
own ears only
give me solitudegive me naturegive me again, o nature, your primal
sanities
these, demanding to have them, tired with ceaseless excitement, and
racked by the warstrife,
these to procure incessantly asking, rising in cries from my heart,
while yet incessantly asking, still i adhere to my city
day upon day, and year upon year, o city, walking your streets,
where you hold me enchained a certain time, refusing to give me up,
yet giving to make me glutted, enriched of soulyou give me for ever
faces
o i see what i sought to escape, confronting, reversing my cries
i see my own soul trampling down what it asked for

keep your splendid silent sun
keep your woods, o nature, and the quiet places by the woods
keep your fields of clover and timothy, and your cornfields and orchards
keep the blossoming buckwheat fields, where the ninthmonth bees hum
give me faces and streets give me these phantoms incessant and endless
along the trottoirs
give me interminable eyes give me women give me comrades and lovers by
the thousand
let me see new ones every day let me hold new ones by the hand every day
give me such shows give me the streets of manhattan
give me broadway, with the soldiers marchinggive me the sound of the
trumpets and drums
the soldiers in companies or regimentssome starting away, flushed and
reckless
some, their time up, returning, with thinned ranksyoung, yet very old,
worn, marching, noticing nothing
give me the shores and the wharves heavyfringed with the black ships
o such for me o an intense life o full to repletion, and varied
the life of the theatre, barroom, huge hotel, for me
the saloon of the steamer, the crowded excursion, for me the torchlight
procession
the dense brigade, bound for the war, with highpiled military waggons
following
people, endless, streaming, with strong voices, passions, pageants
manhattan streets, with their powerful throbs, with the beating drums, as
now
the endless and noisy chorus, the rustle and clank of muskets, even the
sight of the wounded
manhattan crowds, with their turbulent musical choruswith varied chorus
and light of the sparkling eyes
manhattan faces and eyes for ever for me
over the carnage

over the carnage rose prophetic a voice,
be not disheartenedaffection shall solve the problems of freedom yet
those who love each other shall become invinciblethey shall yet make
columbia victorious
sons of the mother of all you shall yet be victorious
you shall yet laugh to scorn the attacks of all the remainder of the earth
no danger shall baulk columbias lovers
if need be, a thousand shall sternly immolate themselves for one
one from massachusetts shall be a missourians comrade
from maine and from hot carolina, and another an oregonese, shall be
friends triune,
more precious to each other than all the riches of the earth
to michigan, florida perfumes shall tenderly come
not the perfumes of flowers, but sweeter, and wafted beyond death
it shall be customary in the houses and streets to see manly affection
the most dauntless and rude shall touch face to face lightly
the dependence of liberty shall be lovers,
the continuance of equality shall be comrades
these shall tie you and band you stronger than hoops of iron
i, ecstatic, o partners o lands with the love of lovers tie you

were you looking to be held together by the lawyers?
or by an agreement on a paper? or by arms?
naynor the world nor any living thing will so cohere
the mother of all
pensive, on her dead gazing, i heard the mother of all,
desperate, on the torn bodies, on the forms covering the battlefields,
gazing
as she called to her earth with mournful voice while she stalked

camps of green

not alone our camps of white, o soldiers,
when, as ordered forward, after a long march,
footsore and weary, soon as the light lessens, we halt for the night
some of us so fatigued, carrying the gun and knapsack, dropping asleep in
our tracks
others pitching the little tents, and the fires lit up begin to sparkle
outposts of pickets posted, surrounding, alert through the dark,
and a word provided for countersign, careful for safety
till to the call of the drummers at daybreak loudly beating the drums,
we rise up refreshed, the night and sleep passed over, and resume our
journey,
or proceed to battle

lo the camps of the tents of green,
which the days of peace keep filling, and the days of war keep filling,
with a mystic army, is it too ordered forward? is it too only halting a
while,
till night and sleep pass over?
now in those camps of greenin their tents dotting the world
in the parents, children, husbands, wives, in themin the old and young,
sleeping under the sunlight, sleeping under the moonlight, content and
silent there at last
behold the mighty bivouacfield and waitingcamp of us and ours and all,
of our corps and generals all, and the president over the corps and
generals all,
and of each of us, o soldiers, and of each and all in the ranks we fight,
there without hatred we shall all meet
for presently, o soldiers, we too camp in our place in the bivouaccamps of
green
but we need not provide for outposts, nor word for the countersign,
nor drummer to beat the morning drum
dirge for two veterans

the last sunbeam
lightly falls from the finished sabbath
on the pavement hereand, there beyond, it is looking
down a newmade double grave

lo the moon ascending
up from the east, the silvery round moon
beautiful over the housetops, ghastly, phantom moon
immense and silent moon

i see a sad procession,
and i hear the sound of coming fullkeyed bugles
all the channels of the city streets theyre flooding,
as with voices and with tears

i hear the great drums pounding,
and the small drums steady whirring
and every blow of the great convulsive drums
strikes me through and through

for the son is brought with the father
in the foremost ranks of the fierce assault they fell
two veterans, son and father, dropped together,
and the double grave awaits them

now nearer blow the bugles,
and the drums strike more convulsive
and the daylight oer the pavement quite has faded,
and the strong deadmarch enwraps me

in the eastern sky upbuoying,
the sorrowful vast phantom moves illumined,
tis some mothers large, transparent face,
in heaven brighter growing

o strong deadmarch, you please me
o moon immense, with your silvery face you soothe me
o my soldiers twain o my veterans, passing to burial
what i have i also give you

the moon gives you light,
and the bugles and the drums give you music
and my heart, o my soldiers, my veterans,
my heart gives you love
survivors
how solemn, as one by one,
as the ranks returning, all worn and sweatyas the men file by where i
stand
as the faces, the masks appearas i glance at the faces, studying the
masks
as i glance upward out of this page, studying you, dear friend, whoever you
are
how solemn the thought of my whispering soul, to each in the ranks, and to
you
i see, behind each mask, that wonder, a kindred soul
o the bullet could never kill what you really are, dear friend,
nor the bayonet stab what you really are
the soul, yourself, i see, great as any, good as the best,
waiting secure and content,which the bullet could never kill,
nor the bayonet stab, o friend
hymn of dead soldiers

one breath, o my silent soul
a perfumed thoughtno more i ask, for the sake of all dead soldiers

buglers off in my armies
at present i ask not you to sound
not at the head of my cavalry, all on their spirited horses,
with their sabres drawn and glistening, and carbines clanking by their
thighsah, my brave horsemen my handsome, tanfaced horsemen
what life, what joy and pride, with all the perils, were yours
nor you drummersneither at reveill, at dawn,
nor the long roll alarming the campnor even the muffled beat for a
burial
nothing from you, this time, o drummers, bearing my warlike drums

but aside from these, and the crowds hurrahs, and the lands
congratulations,
admitting around me comrades close, unseen by the rest, and voiceless,
i chant this chant of my silent soul, in the name of all dead soldiers

faces so pale, with wondrous eyes, very dear, gather closer yet
draw close, but speak not
phantoms, welcome, divine and tender
invisible to the rest, henceforth become my companions
follow me ever desert me not, while i live
sweet are the blooming cheeks of the living, sweet are the musical voices
sounding
but sweet, ah sweet, are the dead, with their silent eyes
dearest comrades all now is over
but love is not overand what love, o comrades
perfume from battlefields risingup from foetor arising
perfume therefore my chant, o love immortal love
give me to bathe the memories of all dead soldiers
perfume all make all wholesome
o love o chant solve all with the last chemistry
give me exhaustlessmake me a fountain,
that i exhale love from me wherever i go,
for the sake of all dead soldiers
spirit whose work is done
spirit whose work is done spirit of dreadful hours
ere, departing, fade from my eyes your forests of bayonets
spirit of gloomiest fears and doubts, yet onward ever unfaltering pressing
spirit of many a solemn day, and many a savage scene electric spirit
that with muttering voice, through the years now closed, like a tireless
phantom flitted,
rousing the land with breath of flame, while you beat and beat the drum
now, as the sound of the drum, hollow and harsh to the last, reverberates
round me
as your ranks, your immortal ranks, return, return from the battles
while the muskets of the young men yet lean over their shoulders
while i look on the bayonets bristling over their shoulders
while those slanted bayonets, whole forests of them, appearing in the
distance, approach and pass on, returning homeward,
moving with steady motion, swaying to and fro, to the right and left,
evenly, lightly, rising and falling, as the steps keep time
spirit of hours i knew, all hectic red one day, but pale as death next
day
touch my mouth, ere you departpress my lips close
leave me your pulses of rage bequeath them to me fill me with currents
convulsive
let them scorch and blister out of my chants, when you are gone
let them identify you to the future in these songs
reconciliation
word over all, beautiful as the sky
beautiful that war, and all its deeds of carnage, must in time be utterly
lost
that the hands of the sisters death and night incessantly, softly wash
again, and ever again, this soiled world
for my enemy is deada man divine as myself is dead
i look where he lies, whitefaced and still, in the coffini draw near
i bend down and touch lightly with my lips the white face in the coffin
after the war
to the leavened soil they trod, calling, i sing, for the last
not cities, nor man alone, nor war, nor the dead
but forth from my tent emerging for goodloosing, untying the tentropes
in the freshness, the forenoon air, in the farstretching circuits and
vistas, again to peace restored
to the fiery fields emanative, and the endless vistas beyondto the south
and the north
to the leavened soil of the general western world, to attest my songs,
to the average earth, the wordless earth, witness of war and peace,
to the alleghanian hills, and the tireless mississippi,
to the rocks i, calling, sing, and all the trees in the woods,
to the plain of the poems of heroes, to the prairie spreading wide,
to the faroff sea, and the unseen winds, and the sane impalpable air
and responding they answer all, but not in words,
the average earth, the witness of war and peace, acknowledges mutely
the prairie draws me close, as the father, to bosom broad, the son
the northern ice and rain, that began me, nourish me to the end
but the hot sun of the south is to ripen my songs

and the first object he looked upon, that object he became
and that object became part of him for the day, or a certain part of the
day, or for many years, or tretching cycles of years

the early lilacs became part of this child,
and grass, and white and red morningglories, and white and red clover,
and the song of the phoebebird,
and the thirdmonth lambs, and the sows pinkfaint litter, and the mares

and the noisy brood of the barnyard, or by the mire of the pondside,
and the fish suspending themselves so curiously below thereand the

roots of the garden,
and the appletrees covered with blossoms, and the fruit afterward, and
woodberries, and the commonest weeds by the road
and the old drunkard staggering home from the outhouse of the tavern,
whence he had lately risen,
and the schoolmistress that passed on her way to the school,
and the friendly boys that passed, and the quarrelsome boys,
and the tidy and freshcheeked girls, and the barefoot negro boy and girl,
and all the changes of city and country, wherever he went
his own parents
he that had fathered him, and she that had conceived him in her womb, and
birthed him,
they gave this child more of themselves than that
they gave him afterward every daythey became part of him

and swelling heart,

if after all it should prove unreal,
the doubts of daytime and the doubts of nighttimethe curious whether
and how
whether that which appears so is so, or is it all flashes and specks?
men and women crowding fast in the streetsif they are not flashes and
specks, what are they?
the streets themselves, and the faades of houses, and goods in the
windows,
vehicles, teams, the heavyplanked wharvesthe huge crossing at the
ferries,
the village on the highland, seen from afar at sunsetthe river between
shadows, aureola and mist, light falling on roofs and gables of white or
brown, three miles off
the schooner near by, sleepily dropping down the tidethe little boat
slacktowed astern,
the hurrying tumbling waves quickbroken crests slapping,
the strata of coloured clouds, the long bar of maroontint, away solitary
by itselfthe spread of purity it lies motionless in,
the horizons edge, the flying seacrow, the fragrance of salt marsh and
shore mud
these became part of that child who went forth every day, and who now goes,
and will always go forth every day

a word out of the sea

out of the rocked cradle,
out of the mockingbirds throat, the musical shuttle,
out of the ninthmonth midnight,
over the sterile sands, and the fields beyond, where the child, leaving his
bed, wandered alone, bareheaded, barefoot,
down from the showered halo,
up from the mystic play of shadows, twining and twisting as if they were
alive,
out from the patches of briars and blackberries,
from the memories of the birds that chanted to me,
from your memories, sad brotherfrom the fitful risings and fallings i
heard,
from under that yellow halfmoon, laterisen, and swollen as if with tears,
from those beginning notes of sickness and love, there in the transparent
mist,
from the thousand responses of my heart, never to cease,
from the myriad thencearoused words,
from the word stronger and more delicious than any,
from such, as now they start, the scene revisiting,
as a flock, twittering, rising, or overhead passing,

once, paumanok,
when the snows had melted, and the fifthmonth grass
was growing,
up this seashore, in some briars,
two guests from alabamatwo together,
and their nest, and four lightgreen eggs spotted with brown
and every day the hebird, to and fro, near at hand,
and every day the shebird, crouched on her nest, silent,
with bright eyes
and every day i, a curious boy, never too close, never
disturbing them,
cautiously peering, absorbing, translating

shine shine shine
pour down your warmth, great sun
while we baskwe two together
two together
winds blow south, or winds blow north,
day come white or night come black,
home, or rivers and mountains from home,
singing all time, minding no time,
if we two but keep together

till of a sudden,
maybe killed, unknown to her mate,
one forenoon the shebird crouched not on the nest,
nor returned that afternoon, nor the next,
nor ever appeared again
and thenceforward, all summer, in the sound of the sea,
and at night, under the full of the moon, in calmer weather,
over the hoarse surging of the sea,
or flitting from briar to briar by day,
i saw, i heard at intervals, the remaining one, the hebird,
the solitary guest from alabama

blow blow blow

i wait and i wait, till you blow my mate to me

yes, when the stars glistened
all night long, on the prong of a mossscalloped stake,
down, almost amid the slapping waves,
sat the lone singer, wonderful, causing tears
he called on his mate
he poured forth the meanings which i, of all men, know
yes, my brother, i know
the rest might notbut i have treasured every note
for once, and more than once, dimly, down to the beach gliding,
silent, avoiding the moonbeams, blending myself with the shadows,
recalling now the obscure shapes, the echoes, the sounds and sights after
their sorts,
the white arms out in the breakers tirelessly tossing,
i, with bare feet, a child, the wind wafting my hair,
listened long and long
listened, to keep, to singnow translating the notes,
following you, my brother

o i cannot see in the dimness whether you smile or frown upon me
o vapour, a look, a word o wellbeloved
o you dear womens and mens phantoms
a word then, for i will conquer it,
the word final, superior to all,
subtle, sent upwhat is it?i listen
are you whispering it, and have been all the time, you seawaves?
is that it from your liquid rims and wet sands?

whereto answering, the sea,
delaying not, hurrying not,
whispered me through the night, and very plainly before daybreak,
lisped to me the low and delicious word death
and again deathever death, death, death,
hissing melodious, neither like the bird nor like my aroused childs heart,
but edging near, as privately for me, rustling at my feet,
creeping thence steadily up to my ears, and laving me softly all over,
death, death, death, death, death
which i do not forget,
but fuse the song of my dusky demon and brother,
that he sang to me in the moonlight on paumanoks grey beach,
with the thousand responsive songs, at random,
my own songs, awaked from that hour
and with them the key, the word up from the waves,
the word of the sweetest song, and all songs,
that strong and delicious word which, creeping to my feet,
the sea whispered me
crossing brooklyn ferry

floodtide below me i watch you face to face
clouds of the west sun there half an hour high i see you also face to
face

crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes, how curious you are
to me
on the ferryboats the hundreds and hundreds that cross, returning home,
are more curious to me than you suppose
and you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are more to me,
and more in my meditations, than you might suppose

the impalpable sustenance of me from all things, at all hours of the day
the simple, compact, welljoined schememyself disintegrated, every one
disintegrated, yet part of the scheme
the similitudes of the past, and those of the future
the glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearingson the
walk in the street, and the passage over the river
the current rushing so swiftly, and swimming with me far away
the others that are to follow me, the ties between me and them
the certainty of othersthe life, love, sight, hearing, of others
others will enter the gates of the ferry, and cross from shore to shore
others will watch the run of the floodtide
others will see the shipping of manhattan north and west, and the heights
of brooklyn to the south and east
others will see the islands large and small
fifty years hence, others will see them as they cross, the sun half an hour
high
a hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence, others will see
them,
will enjoy the sunset, the pouringin of the floodtide, the fallingback
to the sea of the ebbtide
it avails not, neither time nor placedistance avails not
i am with youyou men and women of a generation, or ever so many
generations hence
i project myselfalso i returni am with you, and know how it is
just as you feel when you look on the river and sky, so i felt
just as any of you is one of a living crowd, i was one of a crowd
just as you are refreshed by the gladness of the river and the bright flow,
i was refreshed
just as you stand and lean on the rail, yet hurry with the swift current, i
stood, yet was hurried
just as you look on the numberless masts of ships, and the
thickstemmed pipes of steamboats, i looked
i too many and many a time crossed the river, the sun half an hour high
i watched the twelfthmonth seagullsi saw them high in the air, floating
with motionless wings, oscillating their bodies,
i saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies, and left the
rest in strong shadow,
i saw the slowwheeling circles, and the gradual edging toward the south
i too saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water,
had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams,
looked at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my head
in the sunlit water,
looked on the haze on the hills southward and southwestward,
looked on the vapour as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet,
looked toward the lower bay to notice the arriving ships,
saw their approach, saw aboard those that were near me,
saw the white sails of schooners and sloops, saw the ships at anchor,
the sailors at work in the rigging, or out astride the spars
the round masts, the swinging motion of the hulls, the slender serpentine
pennants,
the large and small steamers in motion, the pilots in their
pilothouses,
the white wake left by the passage, the quick tremulous whirl of the
wheels,
the flags of all nations, the falling of them at sunset,
the scallopedged waves in the twilight, the ladled cups, the frolicsome
crests and glistening,
the stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the grey walls of the granite
storehouses by the docks,
on the river the shadowy group, the big steamtug closely flanked on each
side by the bargesthe hayboat, the belated lighter,
on the neighbouring shore, the fires from the foundry chimneys burning high
and glaringly into the night,
casting their flicker of black, contrasted with wild red and yellow light,
over the tops of houses and down into the clefts of streets
these, and all else, were to me the same as they are to you
i project myself a moment to tell youalso i return
i loved well those cities
i loved well the stately and rapid river
the men and women i saw were all near to me
others the sameothers who look back on me because i looked forward to
them
the time will come, though i stop here today and tonight
what is it, then, between us?
what is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us?
whatever it is, it avails notdistance avails not, and place avails not
i too livedbrooklyn, of ample hills, was mine
i too walked the streets of manhattan island, and bathed in the waters
around it
i too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me
in the day, among crowds of people, sometimes they came upon me,
in my walks home late at night, or as i lay in my bed, they came upon me
i too had been struck from the float for ever held in solution, i too had
received identity by my body
that i was, i knew, was of my bodyand what i should be, i knew, i should
be of my body
it is not upon you alone the dark patches fall,
the dark threw patches down upon me also
the best i had done seemed to me blank and suspicious
my great thoughts, as i supposed them, were they not in reality meagre?
would not people laugh at me?
it is not you alone who know what it is to be evil
i am he who knew what it was to be evil
i too knitted the old knot of contrariety,
blabbed, blushed, resented, lied, stole, grudged
had guile, anger, lust, hot wishes i dared not speak
was wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant
the wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me
the cheating look, the frivolous word, the adulterous wish, not wanting
refusals, hates, postponements, meanness, laziness, none of these wanting
but i was manhattanese, friendly and proud
i was called by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as they
saw me approaching or passing,
felt their arms on my neck as i stood, or the negligent leaning of their
flesh against me as i sat
saw many i loved in the street, or ferryboat, or public assembly, yet
never told them a word
lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing,
sleeping
played the part that still looks back on the actor or actress,
the same old rle, the rle that is what we make it,as great as we like,
or as small as we like, or both great and small
closer yet i approach you
what thought you have of me, i had as much of you
i laid in my stores in advance
i considered long and seriously of you before you were born
who was to know what should come home to me?
who knows but i am enjoying this?
who knows but i am as good as looking at you now, for all you cannot see
me?
it is not you alone, nor i alone
not a few races, nor a few generations, nor a few centuries
it is that each came or comes or shall come from its due
emission, without fail, either now or then or henceforth
everything indicatesthe smallest does, and the largest does
a necessary film envelops all, and envelops the soul for a proper time
now i am curious what sight can ever be more stately and admirable to me
than my masthemmed manhatta,
my river and sunset, and my scallopedged waves of floodtide
the seagulls oscillating their bodies, the hayboat in the twilight, and
the belated lighter
curious what gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand, and with
voices i love call me promptly and loudly by my nighest name as i
approach
curious what is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or man
that looks in my face,
which fuses me into you now, and pours my meaning into you
we understand, then, do we not?
what i promised without mentioning it have you not accepted?
what the study could not teachwhat the preaching could not accomplish, is
accomplished, is it not?
what the push of reading could not start, is started by me personally, is
it not?

flow on river flow with the floodtide, and ebb with the ebbtide
frolic on, crested and scallopedged waves
gorgeous clouds of the sunset, drench with your splendour me, or the men
and women generations after me
cross from shore to shore, countless crowds of passengers
stand up, tall masts of mannahattastand up, beautiful hills of brooklyn
bully for you you proud, friendly, free manhattanese
throb, baffled and curious brain throw out questions and answers
suspend here and everywhere, eternal float of solution
blab, blush, lie, steal, you or i or any one after us
gaze, loving and thirsting eyes, in the house, or street, or public
assembly
sound out, voices of young men loudly and musically call me by my nighest
name
live, old life play the part that looks back on the actor or actress
play the old role, the role that is great or small, according as one makes
it
consider, you who peruse me, whether i may not in unknown ways be looking
upon you
be firm, rail over the river, to support those who lean idly, yet haste
with the hasting current
fly on, seabirds fly sideways, or wheel in large circles high in the air
receive the summer sky, you water and faithfully hold it, till all
downcast eyes have time to take it from you
diverge, fine spokes of light, from the shape of my head, or any ones
head, in the sunlit water
come on, ships from the lower bay pass up or down, whitesailed schooners,
sloops, lighters
flaunt away, flags of all nations be duly lowered at sunset
burn high your fires, foundry chimneys cast black shadows at nightfall
cast red and yellow light over the tops of the houses
appearances, now or henceforth, indicate what you are
you necessary film, continue to envelop the soul
about my body for me, and your body for you, be hung our divinest aromas
thrive, cities bring your freight, bring your shows, ample and sufficient
rivers
expand, being than which none else is perhaps more spiritual
keep your places, objects than which none else is more lasting
we descend upon you and all thingswe arrest you all
we realise the soul only by you, you faithful solids and fluids
through you colour, form, location, sublimity, ideality
through you every proof, comparison, and all the suggestions and
determinations of ourselves
you have waited, you always wait, you dumb, beautiful ministers you
novices
we receive you with free sense at last, and are insatiate henceforward
not you any more shall be able to foil us, or withhold yourselves from us
we use you, and do not cast you asidewe plant you permanently within us
we fathom you notwe love youthere is perfection in you also
you furnish your parts toward eternity
great or small, you furnish your parts toward the soul
night and death

night on the prairies
the supper is overthe fire on the ground burns low
the wearied emigrants sleep, wrapped in their blankets
i walk by myselfi stand and look at the stars, which i think now i never
realised before
now i absorb immortality and peace,
i admire death, and test propositions
how plenteous how spiritual how resum
the same old man and soulthe same old aspirations, and the same content

i was thinking the day most splendid, till i saw what the not day
exhibited,
i was thinking this globe enough, till there sprang out so noiseless around
me myriads of other globes
now, while the great thoughts of space and eternity fill me, i will measure
myself by them
and now, touched with the lives of other globes, arrived as far along as
those of the earth,
or waiting to arrive, or passed on farther than those of the earth,
i henceforth no more ignore them than i ignore my own life,
or the lives of the earth arrived as far as mine, or waiting to arrive

o i see now that life cannot exhibit all to meas the day cannot,
i see that i am to wait for what will be exhibited by death
elemental drifts

elemental drifts
o i wish i could impress others as you and the waves have just been
impressing me
as i ebbed with an ebb of the ocean of life,
as i wended the shores i know,
as i walked where the searipples wash you, paumanok,
where they rustle up, hoarse and sibilant,
where the fierce old mother endlessly cries for her castaways,
i, musing, late in the autumn day, gazing off southward,
alone, held by this eternal self of me, out of the pride of which i have
uttered my poems,
was seized by the spirit that trails in the lines underfoot,
in the rim, the sediment, that stands for all the water and all the land of
the globe
fascinated, my eyes, reverting from the south, dropped, to follow those
slender winrows,
chaff, straw, splinters of wood, weeds, and the seagluten,
scum, scales from shining rocks, leaves of saltlettuce, left by the tide
miles walking, the sound of breaking waves the other side of me,
paumanok, there and then, as i thought the old thought of likenesses
these you presented to me, you fishshaped island,
as i wended the shores i know,
as i walked with that eternal self of me, seeking types

as i wend to the shores i know not,
as i list to the dirge, the voices of men and women wrecked,
as i inhale the impalpable breezes that set in upon me,
as the ocean so mysterious rolls toward me closer and closer,
i too but signify, at the utmost, a little washedup drift,
a few sands and dead leaves to gather,
gather, and merge myself as part of the sands and drift
o baffled, baulked, bent to the very earth,
oppressed with myself that i have dared to open my mouth,
aware now that, amid all the blab whose echoes recoil upon me, i have not
once had the least idea who or what i am,
but that before all my insolent poems, the real me stands yet untouched,
untold, altogether unreached,
withdrawn far, mocking me with mockcongratulatory signs and bows,
with peals of distant ironical laughter at every word i have written,
pointing in silence to all these songs, and then to the sand beneath
now i perceive i have not understood anythingnot a single objectand
that no man ever can
i perceive nature, here in sight of the sea, is taking advantage of me, to
dart upon me, and sting me,
because i have dared to open my mouth to sing at all

you oceans both i close with you
these little shreds shall indeed stand for all
you friable shore, with trails of debris
you fishshaped island i take what is underfoot
what is yours is mine, my father
i too, paumanok,
i too have bubbled up, floated the measureless float, and been washed on
your shores
i too am but a trail of drift and debris,
i too leave little wrecks upon you, you fishshaped island
i throw myself upon your breast, my father,
i cling to you so that you cannot unloose me,
i hold you so firm till you answer me something
kiss me, my father,
touch me with your lips, as i touch those i love,
breathe to me, while i hold you close, the secret of the wondrous murmuring
i envy

ebb, ocean of life, the flow will return
cease not your moaning, you fierce old mother,
endlessly cry for your castawaysbut fear not, deny not me,
rustle not up so hoarse and angry against my feet, as i touch you, or
gather from you
i mean tenderly by you,
i gather for myself, and for this phantom, looking down where we lead, and
following me and mine
me and mine
we, loose winrows, little corpses,
froth, snowy white, and bubbles,
see from my dead lips the ooze exuding at last
seethe prismatic colours, glistening and rolling
tufts of straw, sands, fragments,
buoyed hither from many moods, one contradicting another,
from the storm, the long calm, the darkness, the swell
musing, pondering, a breath, a briny tear, a dab of liquid or soil
up just as much out of fathomless workings fermented and thrown
a limp blossom or two, torn, just as much over waves floating, drifted at
random
just as much for us that sobbing dirge of nature
just as much, whence we come, that blare of the cloudtrumpets
we, capricious, brought hither, we know not whence, spread out before you,
you, up there, walking or sitting,
whoever you arewe too lie in drifts at your feet
wonders

who learns my lesson complete?
boss, journeyman, apprenticechurchman and atheist,
the stupid and the wise thinkerparents and offspringmerchant, clerk,
porter, and customer,
editor, author, artist and schoolboydraw nigh and commence
it is no lessonit lets down the bars to a good lesson,
and that to another, and every one to another still

the great laws take and effuse without argument
i am of the same style, for i am their friend,
i love them quits and quitsi do not halt and make salaams
i lie abstracted, and hear beautiful tales of things, and the reasons of
things
they are so beautiful i nudge myself to listen
i cannot say to any person what i heari cannot say it to myselfit is
very wonderful
it is no small matter, this round and delicious globe, moving so exactly in
its orbit for ever and ever, without one jolt, or the untruth of a
single second
i do not think it was made in six days, nor in ten thousand years, nor ten
billions of years,
nor planned and built one thing after another, as an architect plans and
builds a house
i do not think seventy years is the time of a man or woman,
nor that seventy millions of years is the time of a man or woman,
nor that years will ever stop the existence of me, or any one else

is it wonderful that i should be immortal? as every one is immortal
i know it is wonderfulbut my eyesight is equally wonderful, and how i was
conceived in my mothers womb is equally wonderful
and passed from a babe, in the creeping trance of a couple of summers and
winters, to articulate and walkall this is equally wonderful
and that my soul embraces you this hour, and we affect each other without
ever seeing each other, and never perhaps to see each other, is
every bit as wonderful
and that i can think such thoughts as these is just as wonderful
and that i can remind you, and you think them and know them to be true, is
just as wonderful
and that the moon spins round the earth, and on with the earth, is equally
wonderful
and that they balance themselves with the sun and stars is equally
wonderful
miracles

what shall i give? and which are my miracles?

realism is minemy miraclestake freely,
take without endi offer them to you wherever your feet can carry you or
your eyes reach

why who makes much of a miracle?
as to me, i know of nothing else but miracles,
whether i walk the streets of manhattan,
or dart my sight over the roofs of houses toward the sky,
or wade with naked feet along the beach, just in the edge of the water,
or stand under trees in the woods,
or talk by day with any one i loveor sleep in the bed at night with any
one i love,
or sit at the table at dinner with my mother,
or look at strangers opposite me riding in the car,
or watch honeybees busy around the hive, of a summer forenoon,
or animals feeding in the fields,
or birdsor the wonderfulness of insects in the air,
or the wonderfulness of the sundownor of stars shining so quiet and
bright,
or the exquisite, delicate, thin curve of the new moon in spring
or whether i go among those i like best, and that like me bestmechanics,
boatmen, farmers,
or among the savansor to the soireor to the opera
or stand a long while looking at the movements of machinery,
or behold children at their sports,
or the admirable sight of the perfect old man, or the perfect old woman,
or the sick in hospitals, or the dead carried to burial,
or my own eyes and figure in the glass
these, with the rest, one and all, are to me miracles,
the whole referringyet each distinct and in its place

to me, every hour of the light and dark is a miracle,
every inch of space is a miracle,
every square yard of the surface of the earth is spread with the same,
every cubic foot of the interior swarms with the same
every spear of grassthe frames, limbs, organs, of men and women, and all
that concerns them,
all these to me are unspeakably perfect miracles
to me the sea is a continual miracle
the fishes that swimthe rocksthe motion of the wavesthe ships, with
men in them,
what stranger miracles are there?
visages
of the visages of thingsand of piercing through to the accepted hells
beneath
of uglinessto me there is just as much in it as there is in
beautyand now the ugliness of human beings is acceptable to me
of detected personsto me, detected persons are not, in any respect, worse
than undetected personsand are not in any respect worse than i am
myself
of criminalsto me, any judge, or any juror, is equally criminaland any
reputable person is alsoand the president is also
the dark side
i sit and look out upon all the sorrows of the world, and upon all
oppression and shame
i hear secret convulsive sobs from young men, at anguish with themselves,
remorseful after deeds done
i see, in low life, the mother misused by her children, dying, neglected,
gaunt, desperate
i see the wife misused by her husbandi see the treacherous seducer of
young women
i mark the ranklings of jealousy and unrequited love, attempted to be hid
i see these sights on the earth
i see the workings of battle, pestilence, tyrannyi see martyrs and
prisoners
i observe a famine at seai observe the sailors casting lots who shall be
killed, to preserve the lives of the rest
i observe the slights and degradations cast by arrogant persons upon
labourers, the poor, and upon negroes, and the like
all theseall the meanness and agony without end, i, sitting, look out
upon
see, hear, and am silent
music
i heard you, solemnsweet pipes of the organ, as last sunday morn i passed
the church
winds of autumnas i walked the woods at dusk, i heard your
longstretched sighs, up above, so mournful
i heard the perfect italian tenor, singing at the operai heard the
soprano in the midst of the quartette singing
heart of my love you too i heard, murmuring low, through one of the
wrists around my head
heard the pulse of you, when all was still, ringing little bells last night
under my ear
wherefore?
o me o lifeof the questions of these recurring
of the endless trains of the faithlessof cities filled with the foolish
of myself for ever reproaching myself, for who more foolish than i, and
who more faithless?
of eyes that vainly crave the lightof the objects meanof the struggle
ever renewed
of the poor results of allof the plodding and sordid crowds i see around
me
of the empty and useless years of the restwith the rest me intertwined
the question, o me so sad, recurringwhat good amid these, o me, o life?
answer
that you are herethat life exists, and identity
that the powerful play goes on, and you will contribute a verse
questionable
as i lay with my head in your lap, camerado,
the confession i made i resumewhat i said to you and the open air i
resume
i know i am restless, and make others so
i know my words are weapons, full of danger, full of death
indeed i am myself the real soldier
it is not he, there, with his bayonet, and not the redstriped
artilleryman
for i confront peace, security, and all the settled laws, to unsettle them
i am more resolute because all have denied me than i could ever have been
had all accepted me
i heed not, and have never heeded, either experience, cautions, majorities,
nor ridicule
and the threat of what is called hell is little or nothing to me
and the lure of what is called heaven is little or nothing to me
dear camerado i confess i have urged you onward with me, and still urge
you, without the least idea what is our destination,
or whether we shall be victorious, or utterly quelled and defeated
song at sunset

splendour of ended day, floating and filling me
hour prophetichour resuming the past
inflating my throatyou, divine average
you, earth and life, till the last ray gleams, i sing

open mouth of my soul, uttering gladness,
eyes of my soul, seeing perfection,
natural life of me, faithfully praising things
corroborating for ever the triumph of things

illustrious every one
illustrious what we name spacesphere of unnumbered spirits
illustrious the mystery of motion, in all beings, even the tiniest insect
illustrious the attribute of speechthe sensesthe body
illustrious the passing light illustrious the pale reflection on the new
moon in the western sky
illustrious whatever i see, or hear, or touch, to the last
good in all,
in the satisfaction and aplomb of animals,
in the annual return of the seasons,
in the hilarity of youth,
in the strength and flush of manhood,
in the grandeur and exquisiteness of old age,
in the superb vistas of death
wonderful to depart
wonderful to be here
the heart, to jet the allalike and innocent blood,
to breathe the air, how delicious
to speak to walk to seize something by the hand
to prepare for sleep, for bedto look on my rosecoloured flesh,
to be conscious of my body, so happy, so large,
to be this incredible god i am,
to have gone forth among other godsthose men and women i love
wonderful how i celebrate you and myself
how my thoughts play subtly at the spectacles around
how the clouds pass silently overhead
how the earth darts on and on and how the sun, moon, stars, dart on and
on
how the water sports and sings surely it is alive
how the trees rise and stand upwith strong trunkswith branches and
leaves
surely there is something more in each of the treessome living soul
o amazement of things even the least particle
o spirituality of things
o strain musical, flowing through ages and continentsnow reaching me and
america
i take your strong chordsi intersperse them, and cheerfully pass them
forward
i too carol the sun, ushered, or at noon, or, as now, setting,
i too throb to the brain and beauty of the earth, and of all the growths of
the earth,
i too have felt the resistless call of myself
as i sailed down the mississippi,
as i wandered over the prairies,
as i have livedas i have looked through my windows, my eyes,
as i went forth in the morningas i beheld the light breaking in the east
as i bathed on the beach of the eastern sea, and again on the beach of the
western sea
as i roamed the streets of inland chicagowhatever streets i have roamed
wherever i have been, i have charged myself with contentment and triumph
i sing the equalities
i sing the endless finales of things
i say nature continuesglory continues
i praise with electric voice
for i do not see one imperfection in the universe
and i do not see one cause or result lamentable at last in the universe
o setting sun though the time has come,
i still warble under you unmitigated adoration
longings for home
o magnet south o glistening, perfumed south my south
o quick mettle, rich blood, impulse, and love good and evil o all dear to
me
o dear to me my birththingsall moving things, and the trees where i was
born, the grains, plants, rivers
dear to me my own slow, sluggish rivers, where they flow distant over flats
of silvery sands or through swamps
dear to me the roanoke, the savannah, the altamahaw, the pedee, the
tombigbee, the santee, the coosa, and the sabine
o pensive, far away wandering, i return with my soul to haunt their banks
again
again in florida i float on transparent lakesi float on okeechobeei
cross
the hummock land, or through pleasant openings or dense forests
i see the parrots in the woods, i see the papawtree, and the blossoming
titi
again, sailing in my coaster, on deck, i coast off georgia, i coast up the
carolinas
i see where the liveoak is growingi see where the yellowpine, the
scented baytree, the lemon and orange, the cypress, the graceful
palmetto
i pass rude seaheadlands, and enter pamlico sound through an inlet, and
dart my vision inland
o the cotton plant the growing fields of rice, sugar, hemp
the cactus, guarded with thornsthe laureltree, with large white flowers
the range afarthe richness and barrennessthe old woods charged with
mistletoe and trailing moss,
the piney odour and the gloomthe awful natural stillness, here in these
dense swamps the freebooter carries his gun, and the fugitive slave
has his concealed hut
o the strange fascination of these halfknown, halfimpassable swamps,
infested by reptiles, resounding with the bellow of the alligator,
the sad noises of the nightowl and the wildcat, and the whirr of
the rattlesnake
the mockingbird, the american mimic, singing all the forenoonsinging
through the moonlit night,
the hummingbird, the wildturkey, the raccoon, the opossum

o to be a virginian, where i grew up o to be a carolinian

footnote  these expressions cannot be understood in a literal
sense, for whitman was born, not in the south, but in the state
of new york the precise sense to be attached to them may be open
to some difference of opinion
appearances
of the terrible doubt of appearances,
of the uncertainty after allthat we may be deluded,
that maybe reliance and hope are but speculations after all,
that maybe identity beyond the grave is a beautiful fable only,
maybe the things i perceivethe animals, plants, men, hills, shining and
flowing waters,
the skies of day and nightcolours, densities, formsmaybe these are as
doubtless they are only apparitions, and the real something has
yet to be known
how often they dart out of themselves, as if to confound me and mock me
how often i think neither i know, nor any man knows, aught of them
maybe seeming to me what they are as doubtless they indeed but seem as
from my present point of viewand might prove as of course they
would naught of what they appear, or naught anyhow, from entirely
changed points of view
to me, these, and the like of these, are curiously answered by my lovers,
my dear friends
when he whom i love travels with me, or sits a long while holding me by the
hand,
when the subtle air, the impalpable, the sense that words and reason hold
not, surround us and pervade us,
then i am charged with untold and untellable wisdomi am silenti require
nothing further,
i cannot answer the question of appearances, or that of identity beyond the
grave
but i walk or sit indifferenti am satisfied,
he ahold of my hand has completely satisfied me
the friend
recorders ages hence
come, i will take you down underneath this impassive exteriori will tell
you what to say of me
publish my name and hang up my picture as that of the tenderest lover,
the friend, the lovers portrait, of whom his friend, his lover, was
fondest,
who was not proud of his songs, but of the measureless ocean of love within
himand freely poured it forth,
who often walked lonesome walks, thinking of his dear friends, his lovers,
who pensive, away from one he loved, often lay sleepless and dissatisfied
at night,
who knew too well the sick, sick dread lest the one he loved might secretly
be indifferent to him,
whose happiest days were far away, through fields, in woods, on hills, he
and another, wandering hand in hand, they twain, apart from other
men,
who oft, as he sauntered the streets, curved with his arm the shoulder of
his friendwhile the arm of his friend rested upon him also
meeting again
when i heard at the close of the day how my name had been received with
plaudits in the capitol, still it was not a happy night for me that
followed
and else, when i caroused, or when my plans were accomplished, still i was
not happy
but the day when i rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health, refreshed,
singing, inhaling the ripe breath of autumn,
when i saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in the morning
light,
when i wandered alone over the beach, and undressing bathed, laughing with
the cool waters, and saw the sunrise,
and when i thought how my dear friend, my lover, was on his way coming, o
then i was happy
o then each breath tasted sweeterand all that day my food nourished me
moreand the beautiful day passed well,
and the next came with equal joyand with the next, at evening, came my
friend
and that night, while all was still, i heard the waters roll slowly
continually up the shores,
i heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands, as directed to me,
whispering, to congratulate me
for the one i love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover in the cool
night,
in the stillness, in the autumn moonbeams, his face was inclined toward me,
and his arm lay lightly around my breastand that night i was happy
a dream
of him i love day and night, i dreamed i heard he was dead
and i dreamed i went where they had buried him i lovebut he was not in
that place
and i dreamed i wandered, searching among burialplaces, to find him
and i found that every place was a burialplace
the houses full of life were equally full of death, this house is now
the streets, the shipping, the places of amusement, the chicago, boston,
philadelphia, the mannahatta, were as full of the dead as of the living,
and fuller, o vastly fuller, of the dead than of the living
and what i dreamed i will henceforth tell to every person and age,
and i stand henceforth bound to what i dreamed
and now i am willing to disregard burialplaces, and dispense with them
and if the memorials of the dead were put up indifferently everywhere, even
in the room where i eat or sleep, i should be satisfied
and if the corpse of any one i love, or if my own corpse, be duly rendered
to powder, and poured in the sea, i shall be satisfied
or if it be distributed to the winds, i shall be satisfied
parting friends
what think you i take my pen in hand to record?
the battleship, perfectmodelled, majestic, that i saw pass the offing to
day under full sail?
the splendours of the past day? or the splendour of the night that envelops
me?
or the vaunted glory and growth of the great city spread around me?no
but i record of two simple men i saw today, on the pier, in the midst of
the crowd, parting the parting of dear friends
the one to remain hung on the others neck, and passionately kissed him,
while the one to depart tightly pressed the one to remain in his arms
to a stranger
passing stranger you do not know how longingly i look upon you
you must be he i was seeking, or she i was seeking it comes to me, as of a
dream
i have somewhere surely lived a life of joy with you
all is recalled as we flit by each other, fluid, affectionate, chaste,
matured
you grew up with me, were a boy with me, or a girl with me
i ate with you, and slept with youyour body has become not yours only,
nor left my body mine only
you give me the pleasure of your eyes, face, flesh, as we passyou take of
my beard, breast, hands in return
i am not to speak to youi am to think of you when i sit alone, or wake at
night alone
i am to waiti do not doubt i am to meet you again
i am to see to it that i do not lose you
other lands
this moment yearning and thoughtful, sitting alone,
it seems to me there are other men in other lands, yearning and thoughtful
it seems to me i can look over and behold them in prussia, italy, france,
spainor far, far away, in china, or in russia or indiatalking
other dialects
and it seems to me, if i could know those men, i should become attached to
them, as i do to men in my own lands
o i know we should be brethren and lovers
i know i should be happy with them
envy
when i peruse the conquered fame of heroes, and the victories of mighty
generals, i do not envy the generals,
nor the president in his presidency, nor the rich in his great house
but when i read of the brotherhood of lovers, how it was with them
how through life, through dangers, odium, unchanging, long and long,
through youth, and through middle and old age, how unfaltering, how
affectionate and faithful they were,
then i am pensivei hastily put down the book, and walk away, filled with
the bitterest envy
the city of friends
i dreamed in a dream i saw a city invincible to the attacks of the whole of
the rest of the earth
i dreamed that it was the new city of friends
nothing was greater there than the quality of robust loveit led the rest
it was seen every hour in the actions of the men of that city,
and in all their looks and words
out of the crowd

out of the rolling ocean, the crowd, came a drop gently to me,
whispering, i love you before long i die
i have travelled a long way, merely to look on you, to touch you
for i could not die till i once looked on you,
for i feared i might afterward lose you

now we have met, we have looked, we are safe
return in peace to the ocean, my love
i too am part of that ocean, my lovewe are not so much separated
behold the great rondurethe cohesion of all, how perfect
but as for me, for you, the irresistible sea is to separate us,
as for an hour carrying us diverseyet cannot carry us diverse for ever
be not impatienta little spaceknow you, i salute the air, the ocean,
and the land,
every day, at sundown, for your dear sake, my love
among the multitude
among the men and women, the multitude,
i perceive one picking me out by secret and divine signs,
acknowledging none elsenot parent, wife, husband, brother, child, any
nearer than i am
some are baffledbut that one is notthat one knows me
ah, lover and perfect equal
i meant that you should discover me so, by my faint indirections
and i, when i meet you, mean to discover you by the like in you
leaves of grass
president lincolns funeral hymn

when lilacs last in the dooryard bloomed,
and the great star early drooped in the western sky in the night,
i mourned,and yet shall mourn with everreturning spring
o everreturning spring trinity sure to me you bring
lilac blooming perennial, and drooping star in the west,
and thought of him i love

o powerful, western, fallen star
o shades of night o moody, tearful night
o great star disappeared o the black murk that hides the star
o cruel hands that hold me powerless o helpless soul of me
o harsh surrounding cloud that will not free my soul

in the dooryard fronting an old farmhouse, near the whitewashed palings,
stands the lilac bush, tallgrowing, with heartshaped leaves of rich
green,
with many a pointed blossom, rising delicate, with the perfume strong i
love,
with every leaf a miracle and from this bush in the dooryard,
with delicatecoloured blossoms, and heartshaped leaves of rich green,
a sprig, with its flower, i break

in the swamp, in secluded recesses,
a shy and hidden bird is warbling a song
solitary, the thrush,
the hermit, withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settlements,
sings by himself a song
song of the bleeding throat
deaths outlet song of lifefor well, dear brother, i know,
if thou wast not gifted to sing, thou wouldst surely die

over the breast of the spring, the land, amid cities,
amid lanes, and through old woods, where lately the violets peeped from the
ground, spotting the greydebris
amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanespassing the endless
grass
passing the yellowspeared wheat, every grain from its shroud in the
darkbrown fields uprising
passing the appletree blows of white and pink in the orchards
carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave,
night and day journeys a coffin

coffin that passes through lanes and streets,
through day and night, with the great cloud darkening the land,
with the pomp of the inlooped flags, with the cities draped in black,
with the show of the states themselves as of crapeveiled women standing,
with processions long and winding, and the flambeaus of the night,
with the countless torches litwith the silent sea of faces,
and the unbared heads,
with the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre faces,
with dirges through the night, with the thousand voices rising strong and
solemn
with all the mournful voices of the dirges, poured around the coffin,
the dimlit churches and the shuddering organswhere amid these you
journey,
with the tolling, tolling bells perpetual clang
here coffin that slowly passes,
i give you my sprig of lilac

nor for you, for one, alone
blossoms and branches green to coffins all i bring
for fresh as the morningthus would i chant a song for you, o sane and
sacred death
all over bouquets of roses,
o death i cover you over with roses and early lilies
but mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first,
copious, i break, i break the sprigs from the bushes
with loaded arms i come, pouring for you,
for you and the coffins all of you, o death

o western orb, sailing the heaven
now i know what you must have meant, as a month since we walked,
as we walked up and down in the dark blue so mystic,
as we walked in silence the transparent shadowy night,
as i saw you had something to tell, as you bent to me night after night,
as you drooped from the sky low down, as if to my side, while the other
stars all looked on
as we wandered together the solemn night, for something, i know not what,
kept me from sleep
as the night advanced, and i saw on the rim of the west, ere you went, how
full you were of woe
as i stood on the rising ground in the breeze, in the cool transparent
night,
as i watched where you passed and was lost in the netherward  black of the
night,
as my soul, in its trouble, dissatisfied, sank, as where you, sad orb,
concluded, dropped in the night, and was gone

sing on, there in the swamp
o singer bashful and tender i hear your notesi hear your call
i heari come presentlyi understand you
but a moment i lingerfor the lustrous star has detained me
the star, my comrade departing, holds and detains me

o how shall i warble myself for the dead one there i loved?
and how shall i deck my song for the large sweet soul that has gone?
and what shall my perfume be for the grave of him i love?
seawinds, blown from east and west,
blown from the eastern sea, and blown from the western sea, till there on
the prairies meeting
these, and with these, and the breath of my chant,
i perfume the grave of him i love

o what shall i hang on the chamber walls?
and what shall the pictures be that i hang on the walls,
to adorn the burialhouse of him i love?
pictures of growing spring, and farms, and homes,
with the fourthmonth eve at sundown, and the grey smoke lucid and bright,
with floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent sinking sun,
burning, expanding the air
with the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale green leaves of the
trees prolific
in the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river,
with a winddapple here and there
with ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky, and
shadows
and the city at hand, with dwellings so dense, and stacks of chimneys,
and all the scenes of life, and the workshops, and the workmen homeward
returning

lo body and soul this land
mighty manhattan, with spires, and the sparkling and hurrying tides, and
the ships
the varied and ample landthe south and the north in the
lightohios shores, and flashing missouri,
and ever the farspreading prairies, covered with grass and corn
lo the most excellent sun, so calm and haughty
the violet and purple morn, with justfelt breezes
the gentle, softborn, measureless light
the miracle, spreading, bathing allthe fulfilled noon
the coming eve, deliciousthe welcome night, and the stars,
over my cities shining all, enveloping man and land

sing on sing on, you greybrown bird
sing from the swamps, the recessespour your chant from the bushes
limitless out of the dusk, out of the cedars and pines
sing on, dearest brotherwarble your reedy song,
loud human song, with voice of uttermost woe
o liquid, and free, and tender
o wild and loose to my soul o wondrous singer
you only i hear, yet the star holds me, but will soon depart
yet the lilac, with mastering odour, holds me

now while i sat in the day, and looked forth,
in the close of the day, with its light, and the fields of spring, and the
farmer preparing his crops,
in the large unconscious scenery of my land, with its lakes and forests,
in the heavenly aerial beauty, after the perturbed winds and the storms
under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing, and the voices of
children and women,
the manymoving seatides,and i saw the ships how they sailed,
and the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all busy with
labour,
and the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each with its meals
and minutiae of daily usages
and the streets, how their throbbings throbbed, and the cities
pentlo then and there,
falling upon them all, and among them all, enveloping me with the rest,
appeared the cloud, appeared the long black trail
and i knew death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of death

and the thought of death closewalking the other side of me,
and i in the middle, as with companions, and as holding the hands of
companions,
i fled forth to the hiding receiving night, that talks not,
down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the dimness,
to the solemn shadowy cedars, and ghostly pines so still
and the singer so shy to the rest received me
the greybrown bird i know received us comrades three
and he sang what seemed the song of death, and a verse for him i love
from deep secluded recesses,
from the fragrant cedars, and the ghostly pines so still,
came the singing of the bird
and the charm of the singing rapt me,
as i held, as if by their hands, my comrades in the night
and the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird

come, lovely and soothing death,
undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,
in the day, in the night, to all, to each,
sooner or later, delicate death
praised be the fathomless universe,
for life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious
and for love, sweet lovebut praise o praise and praise,
for the sureenwinding arms of coolenfolding death
dark mother, always gliding near, with soft feet,
have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?
then i chant it for theei glorify thee above all
i bring thee a song that, when thou must indeed come, come unfalteringly
approach, encompassing deathstrong deliveress
when it is sowhen thou hast taken them, i joyously sing the dead,
lost in the loving, floating ocean of thee,
laved in the flood of thy bliss, o death
from me to thee glad serenades,
dances for thee i propose, saluting theeadornments and feastings for
thee
and the sights of the open landscape, and the highspread sky, are fitting,
and life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night
the night, in silence, under many a star
the ocean shore, and the husky whispering wave, whose voice i know
and the soul turning to thee, o vast and wellveiled death,
and the body gratefully nestling close to thee
over the treetops i float thee a song
over the rising and sinking wavesover the myriad fields, and the prairies
wide
over the densepacked cities all, and the teeming wharves and ways,
i float this carol with joy, with joy, to thee, o death

to the tally of my soul
loud and strong kept up the greybrown bird,
with pure, deliberate notes, spreading, filling the night
loud in the pines and cedars dim,
clear in the freshness moist, and the swampperfume,
and i with my comrades there in the night
while my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed,
as to long panoramas of visions

i saw the vision of armies
and i saw, as in noiseless dreams, hundreds of battleflags
borne through the smoke of the battles, and pierced with missiles, i saw
them,
and carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody
and at last but a few shreds of the flags left on the staffs, and all in
silence,
and the staffs all splintered and broken
i saw battlecorpses, myriads of them,
and the white skeletons of young meni saw them
i saw the debris and debris of all dead soldiers
but i saw they were not as was thought
they themselves were fully at restthey suffered not
the living remained and sufferedthe mother suffered,
and the wife and the child, and the musing comrade suffered,
and the armies that remained suffered

passing the visions, passing the night
passing, unloosing the hold of my comrades hands
passing the song of the hermit bird, and the tallying song of my soul
victorious song, deaths outlet song, yet varying, everaltering song
as low and wailing, yet clear, the notes, rising and falling, flooding the
night,
sadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again bursting
with joy
covering the earth, and filling the spread of the heaven,
as that powerful psalm in the night, i heard from recesses

must i leave thee, lilac with heartshaped leaves?
must i leave thee there in the dooryard, blooming, returning with spring?
must i pass from my song for thee
from my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with thee,
o comrade lustrous, with silver face in the night?

yet each i keep, and all
the song, the wondrous chant of the greybrown bird,
and the tallying chant, the echo aroused in my soul,
with the lustrous and drooping star, with the countenance full of woe
with the lilac tali, and its blossoms of mastering odour
comrades mine, and i in the midst, and their memory ever i keepfor the
dead i loved so well
for the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and landsand this for his
dear sake
lilac and star and bird, twined with the chant of my soul,
with the holders holding my hand, nearing the call of the bird,

o captain my captain
for the death of lincoln

o captain my captain our fearful trip is done
the ship has weathered every wrack, the prize we sought is won
the port is near, the bells i hear, the people all exulting,
while follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring
but, o heart heart heart
leave you not the little spot
where on the deck my captain lies,
fallen cold and dead

o captain my captain rise up and hear the bells
rise up for you the flag is flung, for you the bugle trills
for you bouquets and ribboned wreaths for you the shores acrowding
for you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning
o captain dear father
this arm i push beneath you
it is some dream that on the deck
youve fallen cold and dead

my captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still
my father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will
but the ship, the ship is anchored safe, its voyage closed and done
from fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won
exult, o shores and ring, o bells
but i, with silent tread,
walk the spot my captain lies,
fallen cold and dead

earth, round, rolling, compactsuns, moons, animalsall these are words
to be said
watery, vegetable, sauroid advancesbeings, premonitions, lispings of
the future,
behold these are vast words to be said
were you thinking that those were the wordsthose upright lines? those
curves, angles, dots?
no, those are not the wordsthe substantial words are in the ground and
sea,
they are in the airthey are in you
were you thinking that those were the wordsthose delicious sounds out of
your friends mouths?
no the real words are more delicious than they
human bodies are words, myriads of words
in the best poems reappears the body, mans or womans, wellshaped,
natural, gay
every part able, active, receptive, without shame or the need of shame
air, soil, water, firethese are words
i myself am a word with themmy qualities interpenetrate
with theirsmy name is nothing to them
though it were told in the three thousand languages, what would air, soil,
water, fire, know of my name?
a healthy presence, a friendly or commanding gesture, are words, sayings,
meanings
the charms that go with the mere looks of some men and women are sayings
and meanings also

the workmanship of souls is by the inaudible words of the earth
the great masters know the earths words, and use them more than the
audible words
amelioration is one of the earths words
the earth neither lags nor hastens
it has all attributes, growths, effects, latent in itself from the jump
it is not half beautiful onlydefects and excrescences show just as much
as perfections show
the earth does not withholdit is generous enough
the truths of the earth continually wait, they are not so concealed either
they are calm, subtle, untransmissible by print
they are imbued through all things, conveying themselves willingly,
conveying a sentiment and invitation of the earth i utter and utter
i speak not yet, if you hear me not, of what avail am i to you?
to bearto better lacking these, of what avail am i?

will you rot your own fruit in yourself there?
will you squat and stifle there?
the earth does not argue,
is not pathetic, has no arrangements,
does not scream, haste, persuade, threaten, promise,
makes no discriminations, has no conceivable failures,
closes nothing, refuses nothing, shuts none out
of all the powers, objects, states, it notifies, shuts none out
the earth does not exhibit itself, nor refuse to exhibit itselfpossesses
still underneath
underneath the ostensible sounds, the august chorus of heroes, the wail of
slaves,
persuasions of lovers, curses, gasps of the dying, laughter of young
people, accents of bargainers,
underneath these, possessing the words that never fail
to her children, the words of the eloquent dumb great mother never fail
the true words do not fail, for motion does not fail, and reflection does
not fail
also the day and night do not fail, and the voyage we pursue does not fail

sits she whom i too love like the restsits undisturbed,

from the open countenances of animals, or from inanimate things,
from the landscape or waters, or from the exquisite apparition of the sky,

earth
i swear i begin to see love with sweeter spasms than that which responds
love
it is that which contains itselfwhich never invites, and never refuses
i swear i begin to see little or nothing in audible words
i swear i think all merges toward the presentation of the unspoken meanings
of the earth
toward him who sings the songs of the body, and of the truths of the earth
toward him who makes the dictionaries of words that print cannot touch
i swear i see what is better than to tell the best
it is always to leave the best untold
when i undertake to tell the best, i find i cannot,
my tongue is ineffectual on its pivots,
my breath will not be obedient to its organs,
i become a dumb man
the best of the earth cannot be told anyhowall or any is best
it is not what you anticipatedit is cheaper, easier, nearer
things are not dismissed from the places they held before
the earth is just as positive and direct as it was before
facts, religions, improvements, politics, trades, are as real as before
but the soul is also real,it too is positive and direct
no reasoning, no proof has established it,
undeniable growth has established it

this is a poem for the sayers of wordsthese are hints of meanings,
these are they that echo the tones of souls, and the phrases of souls
if they did not echo the phrases of souls, what were they then?
if they had not reference to you in especial, what were they then?
i swear i will never henceforth have to do with the faith that tells the
best
i will have to do only with that faith that leaves the best untold

say on, sayers
delve mould pile the words of the earth
work onit is materials you bring, not breaths
work on, age after age nothing is to be lost
it may have to wait long, but it will certainly come in use
when the materials are all prepared, the architects shall appear
i swear to you the architects shall appear without fail i announce them
and lead them
i swear to you they will understand you and justify you
i swear to you the greatest among them shall be he who best knows you, and
encloses all, and is faithful to all
i swear to you, he and the rest shall not forget youthey shall perceive
that you are not an iota less than they
i swear to you, you shall be glorified in them
voices

now i make a leaf of voicesfor i have found nothing mightier than they
are,
and i have found that no word spoken but is beautiful in its place

o what is it in me that makes me tremble so at voices?
surely, whoever speaks to me in the right voice, him or her i shall follow,
as the water follows the moon, silently, with fluid steps anywhere around
the globe
all waits for the right voices
where is the practised and perfect organ? where is the developed soul?
for i see every word uttered thence has deeper, sweeter, new sounds,
impossible on less terms
i see brains and lips closedtympans and temples unstruck,
until that comes which has the quality to strike and to unclose,
until that comes which has the quality to bring forth what lies slumbering,
for ever ready, in all words
whosoever
whoever you are, i fear you are walking the walks of dreams,
i fear those supposed realities are to melt from under your feet and hands
even now, your features, joys, speech, house, trade, manners, troubles,
follies, costume, crimes, dissipate away from you,
your true soul and body appear before me,
they stand forth out of affairsout of commerce, shops, law, science, work,
farms, clothes, the house, medicine, print, buying, selling,
eating, drinking, suffering, dying
whoever you are, now i place my hand upon you, that you be my poem
i whisper with my lips close to your ear,
i have loved many women and men, but i love none better than you
oh i have been dilatory and dumb
i should have made my way straight to you long ago
i should have blabbed nothing but you, i should have chanted nothing but
you
i will leave all, and come and make the hymns of you
none have understood you, but i understand you
none have done justice to youyou have not done justice to yourself
none but have found you imperfecti only find no imperfection in you
none but would subordinate youi only am he who will never consent to
subordinate you
i only am he who places over you no master, owner, better, god, beyond what
waits intrinsically in yourself
painters have painted their swarming groups, and the centre figure of all,
from the head of the centre figure spreading a nimbus of
goldcoloured light
but i paint myriads of heads, but paint no head without its nimbus of gold
coloured light
from my hand, from the brain of every man and woman, it streams,
effulgently flowing for ever
o i could sing such grandeurs and glories about you
you have not known what you areyou have slumbered upon yourself all your
life
your eyelids have been the same as closed most of the time
what you have done returns already in mockeries
your thrift, knowledge, prayers, if they do not return in mockeries, what
is their return?
the mockeries are not you
underneath them, and within them, i see you lurk
i pursue you where none else has pursued you
silence, the desk, the flippant expression, the night, the accustomed
routine, if these conceal you from others, or from yourself, they
do not conceal you from me
the shaved face, the unsteady eye, the impure complexion, if these baulk
others, they do not baulk me
the pert apparel, the deformed attitude, drunkenness, greed, premature
death, all these i part aside
there is no endowment in man or woman that is not tallied in you
there is no virtue, no beauty, in man or woman, but as good is in you
no pluck, no endurance in others, but as good is in you
no pleasure waiting for others, but an equal pleasure waits for you
as for me, i give nothing to any one, except i give the like carefully to
you
i sing the songs of the glory of none, not god, sooner than i sing the
songs of the glory of you
whoever you are claim your own at any hazard
these shows of the east and west are tame compared to you
these immense meadowsthese interminable riversyou are immense and
interminable as they
these furies, elements, storms, motions of nature, throes of apparent
dissolutionyou are he or she who is master or mistress over them,
master or mistress in your own right over nature, elements, pain, passion,
dissolution
the hopples fall from your anklesyou find an unfailing sufficiency
old or young, male or female, rude, low, rejected by the rest, whatever you
are promulgates itself
through birth, life, death, burial, the means are provided, nothing is
scanted
through angers, losses, ambition, ignorance, ennui, what you are picks its
way
beginners
how they are provided for upon the earth, appearing at intervals
how dear and dreadful they are to the earth
how they inure to themselves as much as to anywhat a paradox appears
their age
how people respond to them, yet know them not
how there is something relentless in their fate, all times
how all times mischoose the objects of their adulation and reward,
and how the same inexorable price must still be paid for the same great
purchase
to a pupil

is reform needed? is it through you?
the greater the reform needed, the greater the personality you need to
accomplish it
you do you not see how it would serve to have eyes, blood, complexion,
clean and sweet?
do you not see how it would serve to have such a body and soul that, when
you enter the crowd, an atmosphere of desire and command enters
with you, and every one is impressed with your personality?

o the magnet the flesh over and over
go, dear friend if need be, give up all else, and commence today to inure
yourself to pluck, reality, selfesteem, definiteness,
elevatedness
rest not, till you rivet and publish yourself of your own personality
links

think of the soul
i swear to you that body of yours gives proportions to your soul somehow to
live in other spheres
i do not know how, but i know it is so

think of loving and being loved
i swear to you, whoever you are, you can interfuse yourself with such
things that everybody that sees you shall look longingly upon you

think of the past
i warn you that, in a little while, others will find their past in you and
your times
the race is never separatednor man nor woman escapes
all is inextricablethings, spirits, nature, nations, you toofrom
precedents you come
recall the everwelcome defiers the mothers precede them
recall the sages, poets, saviours, inventors, lawgivers, of the earth
recall christ, brother of rejected personsbrother of slaves, felons,
idiots, and of insane and diseased persons

think of the time when you was not yet born
think of times you stood at the side of the dying
think of the time when your own body will be dying
think of spiritual results
sure as the earth swims through the heavens, does every one of its objects
pass into spiritual results
think of manhood, and you to be a man
do you count manhood, and the sweet of manhood, nothing?
think of womanhood, and you to be a woman
the creation is womanhood
have i not said that womanhood involves all?
have i not told how the universe has nothing better than the best
womanhood?

to identify the sixteenth, seventeenth, or eighteenth presidentiad
why reclining, interrogating? why myself and all drowsing?
what deepening twilight scum floating atop of the waters
who are they, as bats and nightdogs, askant in the capitol?
what a filthy presidentiad o south, your torrid suns o north, your
arctic freezings
are those really congressmen? are those the great judges? is that the
president?
then i will sleep a while yetfor i see that these states sleep, for
reasons
with gathering murkwith muttering thunder and lambent shoots, we all duly
awake, south, north, east, west, inland and seaboard, we will
surely awake

what shapeless lump is that, bent, crouched there on the sand?

o storm, embodied, rising, careering, with swift steps along the beach

a young steersman, steering with care
a bell through fog on a seacoast dolefully ringing,
an oceanbello a warning bell, rocked by the waves
o you give good notice indeed, you bell by the seareefs ringing,
ringing, ringing, to warn the ship from its wreckplace
for, as on the alert, o steersman, you mind the bells admonition,

greatness

great are the mythsi too delight in them
great are adam and evei too look back and accept them
great the risen and fallen nations, and their poets, women, sages,
inventors, rulers, warriors, and priests
great is liberty great is equality i am their follower
helmsmen of nations, choose your craft where you sail, i sail,
i weather it out with you, or sink with you
great is youthequally great is old agegreat are the day and night
great is wealthgreat is povertygreat is expressiongreat is silence

youth, large, lusty, lovingyouth, full of grace, force, fascination
do you know that old age may come after you, with equal grace, force,
fascination?
day, fullblown and splendidday of the immense sun, action, ambition,
laughter,
the night follows close, with millions of suns, and sleep, and restoring
darkness
wealth, with the flush hand, fine clothes, hospitality
but then the souls wealth, which is candour, knowledge, pride, enfolding
love
who goes for men and women showing poverty richer than wealth?
expression of speech in what is written or said, forget not that silence
is also expressive
that anguish as hot as the hottest, and contempt as cold as the coldest,
may be without words

great is the earth, and the way it became what it is
do you imagine it has stopped at this? the increase abandoned?
understand then that it goes as far onward from this as this is from the
times when it lay in covering waters and gases, before man had
appeared

great is the quality of truth in man
the quality of truth in man supports itself through all changes
it is inevitably in the manhe and it are in love, and never leave each
other
the truth in man is no dictum, it is vital as eyesight
if there be any soul, there is truthif there be man or woman, there is
truthif there be physical or moral, there is truth
if there be equilibrium or volition, there is truthif there be things at
all upon the earth, there is truth
o truth of the earth o truth of things i am determined to press my way
toward you
sound your voice i scale mountains, or dive in the sea, after you

great is languageit is the mightiest of the sciences,
it is the fulness, colour, form, diversity of the earth, and of men and
women, and of all qualities and processes
it is greater than wealth, it is greater than buildings, ships, religions,
paintings, music
great is the english speechwhat speech is so great as the english?
great is the english broodwhat brood has so vast a destiny as the
english?
it is the mother of the brood that must rule the earth with the new rule
the new rule shall rule as the soul rules, and as the love, justice,
equality in the soul rule

great is lawgreat are the old few landmarks of the law,
they are the same in all times, and shall not be disturbed
great is justice
justice is not settled by legislators and lawsit is in the soul
it cannot be varied by statutes, any more than love, pride, the attraction
of gravity, can
it is immutableit does not depend on majoritiesmajorities or what not
come at last before the same passionless and exact tribunal
for justice are the grand natural lawyers, and perfect judgesit is in
their souls
it is well assortedthey have not studied for nothingthe great includes
the less
they rule on the highest groundsthey oversee all eras, states,
administrations
the perfect judge fears nothinghe could go front to front before god
before the perfect judge all shall stand backlife and death shall stand
backheaven and hell shall stand back

great is life, real and mystical, wherever and whoever
great is deathsure as life holds all parts together, death holds all
parts together
has life much purport?ah death has the greatest purport
the poet

now list to my mornings romanza
to the cities and farms i sing, as they spread in the sunshine before me

a young man came to me bearing a message from his brother
how should the young man know the whether and when of his brother?
tell him to send me the signs
and i stood before the young man face to face, and took his right hand in
my left hand, and his left hand in my right hand,
and i answered for his brother, and for men, and i answered for the poet,
and sent these signs
him all wait forhim all yield up tohis word is decisive and final,
him they accept, in him lave, in him perceive themselves, as amid light,
him they immerse, and he immerses them
beautiful women, the haughtiest nations, laws, the landscape, people,
animals,
the profound earth and its attributes, and the unquiet ocean so tell i my
mornings romanza,
all enjoyments and properties, and money, and whatever money will buy,
the best farmsothers toiling and planting, and he unavoidably reaps,
the noblest and costliest citiesothers grading and building, and he
domiciles there,
nothing for any one but what is for himnear and far are for him,the
ships in the offing,
the perpetual shows and marches on land, are for him, if they are for
anybody
he puts things in their attitudes
he puts today out of himself, with plasticity and love
he places his own city, times, reminiscences, parents, brothers and
sisters, associations, employment, politics, so that the rest never
shame them afterward, nor assume to command them
he is the answerer
what can be answered he answersand what cannot be answered, he shows how
it cannot be answered

a man is a summons and challenge
it is vain to skulkdo you hear that mocking and laughter? do you hear
the ironical echoes?
books, friendships, philosophers, priests, action, pleasure, pride, beat up
and down, seeking to give satisfaction
he indicates the satisfaction, and indicates them that beat up and down
also
whichever the sex, whatever the season or place, he may go freshly and
gently and safely, by day or by night
he has the passkey of heartsto him the response of the prying of hands
on the knobs
his welcome is universalthe flow of beauty is not more welcome or
universal than he is
the person he favours by day or sleeps with at night is blessed
every existence has its idiomeverything has an idiom and tongue
he resolves all tongues into his own, and bestows it upon men, and any man
translates, and any man translates himself also
one part does not counteract another parthe is the joinerhe sees how
they join
he says indifferently and alike, how are you, friend? to the president
at his levee,
and he says, goodday, my brother to cudge that hoes in the sugar
field,
and both understand him, and know that his speech is right
he walks with perfect ease in the capitol,
he walks among the congress, and one representative says to another, here
is our equal, appearing and new

then the mechanics take him for a mechanic,
and the soldiers suppose him to be a soldier, and the sailors that he has
followed the sea,
and the authors take him for an author, and the artists for an artist,
and the labourers perceive he could labour with them and love them
no matter what the work is, that he is the one to follow it, or has
followed it,
no matter what the nation, that he might find his brothers and sisters
there
the english believe he comes of their english stock,
a jew to the jew he seemsa russ to the russusual and near, removed from
none
whoever he looks at in the travellers coffeehouse claims him
the italian or frenchman is sure, and the german is sure, and the spaniard
is sure, and the island cuban is sure
the engineer, the deckhand on the great lakes, or on the mississippi, or
st lawrence, or sacramento, or hudson, or paumanok sound, claims him
the gentleman of perfect blood acknowledges his perfect blood
the insulter, the prostitute, the angry person, the beggar, see themselves
in the ways of himhe strangely transmutes them,
they are not vile any morethey hardly know themselves, they are so grown
burial

to think of it
to think of timeof all that retrospection
to think of today, and the ages continued henceforward
have you guessed you yourself would not continue?
have you dreaded these earthbeetles?
have you feared the future would be nothing to you?
is today nothing? is the beginningless past nothing?
if the future is nothing, they are just as surely nothing
to think that the sun rose in the east that men and women were flexible,
real, alive that everything was alive
to think that you and i did not see, feel, think, nor bear our part
to think that we are now here, and bear our part

not a day passesnot a minute or second, without an accouchement
not a day passesnot a minute or second, without a corpse
the dull nights go over, and the dull days also,
the soreness of lying so much in bed goes over,
the physician, after long putting off, gives the silent and terrible look
for an answer,
the children come hurried and weeping, and the brothers and sisters are
sent for
medicines stand unused on the shelfthe camphorsmell has long pervaded
the rooms,
the faithful hand of the living does not desert the hand of the dying,
the twitching lips press lightly on the forehead of the dying,
the breath ceases, and the pulse of the heart ceases,
the corpse stretches on the bed, and the living look upon it,
it is palpable as the living are palpable
the living look upon the corpse with their eyesight,
but without eyesight lingers a different living, and looks curiously on the
corpse

to think that the rivers will flow, and the snow fall, and the fruits
ripen, and act upon others as upon us nowyet not act upon us
to think of all these wonders of city and country, and others taking great
interest in themand we takingno interest in them
to think how eager we are in building our houses
to think others shall be just as eager, and we quite indifferent
i see one building the house that serves him a few years, or seventy or
eighty years at most,
i see one building the house that serves him longer than that
slowmoving and black lines creep over the whole earththey never cease
they are the burial lines
he that was president was buried, and he that is now president shall surely
be buried

gold dash of waves at the ferrywharfposh and ice in the river, half
frozen mud in the streets, a grey discouraged sky overhead, the
short last daylight of twelfthmonth,
a hearse and stagesother vehicles give placethe funeral of an old
broadway stagedriver, the cortege mostly drivers
steady the trot to the cemetery, duly rattles the deathbell, the gate is
passed, the newdug grave is halted at, the living alight, the
hearse uncloses,
the coffin is passed out, lowered, and settled, the whip is laid on the
coffin, the earth is swiftly shovelled in,
the mound above is flattened with the spadessilence,
a minute, no one moves or speaksit is done,
he is decently put awayis there anything more?
he was a good fellow, freemouthed, quicktempered, not badlooking, able
to take his own part, witty, sensitive to a slight, ready with life
or death for a friend, fond of women, gambled, ate hearty, drank
hearty, had known what it was to be flush, grew lowspirited toward
the last, sickened, was helped by a contribution, died, aged forty
one yearsand that was his funeral
thumb extended, finger uplifted, apron, cape, gloves, strap, wetweather
clothes, whip carefully chosen, boss, spotter, starter, hostler,
somebody loafing on you, you loafing on somebody, headway, man
before and man behind, good days work, bad days work, pet stock,
mean stock, first out, last out, turningin at night
to think that these are so much and so nigh to other driversand he there
takes no interest in them

the markets, the government, the workingmans wagesto think what account
they are through our nights and days
to think that other workingmen will make just as great account of them
yet we make little or no account
the vulgar and the refinedwhat you call sin, and what you call goodness
to think how wide a difference
to think the difference will still continue to others, yet we lie beyond
the difference
to think how much pleasure there is
have you pleasure from looking at the sky? have you pleasure from poems?
do you enjoy yourself in the city? or engaged in business? or planning a
nomination and election? or with your wife and family?
or with your mother and sisters? or in womanly housework? or the beautiful
maternal cares?
these also flow onward to othersyou and i fly onward,
but in due time you and i shall take less interest in them
your farm, profits, crops,to think how engrossed you are
to think there will still be farms, profits, cropsyet for you, of what
avail?

what will be will be wellfor what is is well
to take interest is well, and not to take interest shall be well
the sky continues beautiful,
the pleasure of men with women shall never be sated, nor the pleasure of
women with men, nor the pleasure from poems
the domestic joys, the daily housework or business, the building of
housesthese are not phantasmsthey have weight, form, location
farms, profits, crops, markets, wages, government, are none of them
phantasms
the difference between sin and goodness is no delusion,
the earth is not an echoman and his life, and all the things of his life,
are wellconsidered
you are not thrown to the windsyou gather certainly and safely around
yourself
yourself yourself yourself, for ever and ever

it is not to diffuse you that you were born of your mother and fatherit
is to identify you
it is not that you should be undecided, but that you should
be decided
something long preparing and formless is arrived and formed in you,
you are henceforth secure, whatever comes or goes
the threads that were spun are gathered, the weft crosses the warp, the
pattern is systematic
the preparations have every one been justified,
the orchestra have sufficiently tuned their instrumentsthe baton has
given the signal
the guest that was cominghe waited long, for reasonshe is now housed
he is one of those who are beautiful and happyhe is one of those that to
look upon and be with is enough
the law of the past cannot be eluded,
the law of the present and future cannot be eluded,
the law of the living cannot be eludedit is eternal
the law of promotion and transformation cannot be eluded,
the law of heroes and gooddoers cannot be eluded,
the law of drunkards, informers, mean personsnot one iota thereof can be
eluded

slowmoving and black lines go ceaselessly over the earth,
northerner goes carried, and southerner goes carried, and they on the
atlantic side, and they on the pacific, and they between, and all
through the mississippi country, and all over the earth
the great masters and kosmos are well as they gothe heroes and gooddoers
are well,
the known leaders and inventors, and the rich owners and pious and
distinguished, may be well,
but there is more account than thatthere is strict account of all
the interminable hordes of the ignorant and wicked are not nothing,
the barbarians of africa and asia are not nothing,
the common people of europe are not nothingthe american aborigines are
not nothing,
the infected in the immigrant hospital are not nothingthe murderer or
mean person is not nothing,
the perpetual successions of shallow people are not nothing as they go,
the lowest prostitute is not nothingthe mocker of religion is not nothing
as he goes

i shall go with the restwe have satisfaction,
i have dreamed that we are not to be changed so much, nor the law of us
changed,
i have dreamed that heroes and gooddoers shall be under the present and
past law,
and that murderers, drunkards, liars, shall be under the present and past
law,
for i have dreamed that the law they are under now is enough
and i have dreamed that the satisfaction is not so much changed, and that
there is no life without satisfaction
what is the earth? what are body and soul without satisfaction?
i shall go with the rest,
we cannot be stopped at a given pointthat is no satisfaction,
to show us a good thing, or a few good things, for a space of timethat is
no satisfaction,
we must have the indestructible breed of the best, regardless of time
if otherwise, all these things came but to ashes of dung,
if maggots and rats ended us, then alarum for we are betrayed
then indeed suspicion of death
do you suspect death? if i were to suspect death, i should die now
do you think i could walk pleasantly and wellsuited toward annihilation?

pleasantly and wellsuited i walk
whither i walk i cannot define, but i know it is good
the whole universe indicates that it is good,
the past and the present indicate that it is good
how beautiful and perfect are the animals how perfect is my soul
how perfect the earth, and the minutest thing upon it
what is called good is perfect, and what is called bad is just as perfect,
the vegetables and minerals are all perfect, and the imponderable fluids
are perfect
slowly and surely they have passed on to this, and slowly and surely they
yet pass on
my soul if i realise you, i have satisfaction
animals and vegetables if i realise you, i have satisfaction
laws of the earth and air if i realise you, i have satisfaction
i cannot define my satisfaction, yet it is so
i cannot define my life, yet it is so

it comes to me now
i swear i think now that everything without exception has an eternal soul
the trees have, rooted in the ground the weeds of the sea have the
animals
i swear i think there is nothing but immortality
that the exquisite scheme is for it, and the nebulous float is for it, and
the cohering is for it
and all preparation is for it and identity is for it and life and death
are altogether for it
this compost

something startles me where i thought i was safest
i withdraw from the still woods i loved
i will not go now on the pastures to walk
i will not strip the clothes from my body to meet my lover the sea
i will not touch my flesh to the earth, as to other flesh, to renew me

o how can the ground not sicken?
how can you be alive, you growths of spring?
how can you furnish health, you blood of herbs, roots, orchards, grain?
are they not continually putting distempered corpses in you?
is not every continent worked over and over with sour dead?
where have you disposed of their carcasses?
those drunkards and gluttons of so many generations
where have you drawn off all the foul liquid and meat?
i do not see any of it upon you todayor perhaps i am deceived
i will run a furrow with my ploughi will press my spade through the sod,
and turn it up underneath
i am sure i shall expose some of the foul meat

behold this compost behold it well
perhaps every mite has once formed part of a sick personyet behold
the grass covers the prairies,
the bean bursts noiselessly through the mould in the garden,
the delicate spear of the onion pierces upward,
the applebuds cluster together on the apple branches,
the resurrection of the wheat appears with pale visage out of its graves,
the tinge awakes over the willowtree and the mulberrytree,
the hebirds carol mornings and evenings, while the shebirds sit on their
nests,
the young of poultry break through the hatched eggs,
the newborn of animals appearthe calf is dropped from the cow, the colt
from the mare,
out of its little hill faithfully rise the potatos darkgreen leaves,
out of its hill rises the yellow maizestalk
the summer growth is innocent and disdainful above all those strata of sour
dead
what chemistry
that the winds are really not infectious,
that this is no cheat, this transparent greenwash of the sea, which is so
amorous after me
that it is safe to allow it to lick my naked body all over with its
tongues,
that it will not endanger me with the fevers that have deposited themselves
in it,
that all is clean for ever and for ever,
that the cool drink from the well tastes so good,
that blackberries are so flavorous and juicy,
that the fruits of the appleorchard, and of the orangeorchardthat
melons, grapes, peaches, plums, will none of them poison me,
that when i recline on the grass i do not catch any disease,
though probably every sphere of grass rises out of what was once a catching
disease

now i am terrified at the earth it is that calm and patient,
it grows such sweet things out of such corruptions,
it turns harmless and stainless on its axis, with such endless successions
of diseased corpses,
it distils such exquisite winds out of such infused fetor,
it renews with such unwitting looks its prodigal, annual, sumptuous crops,
it gives such divine materials to men, and accepts such leavings from them
at last
despairing cries

despairing cries float ceaselessly toward me, day and night,
the sad voice of deaththe call of my nearest lover, putting forth,
alarmed, uncertain,
the sea i am quickly to sail come tell me,
come tell me where i am speedingtell me my destination

i understand your anguish, but i cannot help you
i approach, hear, beholdthe sad mouth, the look out of the eyes, your
mute inquiry,
whither i go from the bed i recline on, come tell me
old age, alarmed, uncertaina young womans voice, appealing to me for
comfort
a young mans voice, shall i not escape?
the city deadhouse
by the city deadhouse, by the gate,
as idly sauntering, wending my way from the clangour,
i curious pausefor lo an outcast form, a poor dead prostitute brought
her corpse they deposit unclaimed, it lies on the damp brick pavement
the divine woman, her bodyi see the bodyi look on it alone,
that house once full of passion and beautyall else i notice not
nor stillness so cold, nor running water from faucet, nor odours morbific
impress me
but the house alonethat wondrous housethat delicate fair housethat
ruin
that immortal house, more than all the rows of dwellings ever built,
or whitedomed capitol itself, with majestic figure surmountedor all the
old highspired cathedrals,
that little house alone, more than them allpoor, desperate house
fair, fearful wreck tenement of a soul itself a soul
unclaimed, avoided house take one breath from my tremulous lips
take one tear, dropped aside as i go, for thought of you,
dead house of love house of madness and sin, crumbled crushed
house of lifeerewhile talking and laughingbut ah, poor house dead even
then
months, years, an echoing, garnished housebut dead, dead, dead
to one shortly to die

from all the rest i single out you, having a message for you
you are to dielet others tell you what they please, i cannot prevaricate,
i am exact and merciless, but i love youthere is no escape for you

softly i lay my right hand upon youyou just feel it
i do not arguei bend my head close, and half envelop it,
i sit quietly byi remain faithful,
i am more than nurse, more than parent or neighbour,
i absolve you from all except yourself, spiritual, bodilythat is
eternal,
the corpse you will leave will be but excrementitious
the sun bursts through in unlookedfor directions
strong thoughts fill you, and confidenceyou smile
you forget you are sick, as i forget you are sick,
you do not see the medicinesyou do not mind the weeping friendsi am
with you,
i exclude others from youthere is nothing to be commiserated,
i do not commiseratei congratulate you
unnamed lands

nations, ten thousand years before these states, and many times ten
thousand years before these states
garnered clusters of ages, that men and women like us grew up and travelled
their course, and passed on
what vastbuilt citieswhat orderly republicswhat pastoral tribes and
nomads
what histories, rulers, heroes, perhaps transcending all others
what laws, customs, wealth, arts, traditions
what sort of marriagewhat costumeswhat physiology and phrenology
what of liberty and slavery among themwhat they thought of death and the
soul
who were witty and wisewho beautiful and poeticwho brutish and
undeveloped
not a mark, not a record remains,and yet all remains

o i know that those men and women were not for nothing, any more than we
are for nothing
i know that they belong to the scheme of the world every bit as much as we
now belong to it, and as all will henceforth belong to it
afar they standyet near to me they stand,
some with oval countenances, learned and calm,
some naked and savagesome like huge collections of insects,
some in tentsherdsmen, patriarchs, tribes, horsemen,
some prowling through woodssome living peaceably on farms, labouring,
reaping, filling barns,
some traversing paved avenues, amid temples, palaces, factories, libraries,
shows, courts, theatres, wonderful monuments
are those billions of men really gone?
are those women of the old experience of the earth gone?
do their lives, cities, arts, rest only with us?
did they achieve nothing for good, for themselves?

i believe, of all those billions of men and women that filled the unnamed
lands, every one exists this hour, here or elsewhere, invisible to
us, in exact proportion to what he or she grew from in life, and
out of what he or she did, felt, became, loved, sinned, in life
i believe that was not the end of those nations, or any person of them, any
more than this shall be the end of my nation, or of me
of their languages, governments, marriage, literature, products, games,
wars, manners, crimes, prisons, slaves, heroes, poets, i suspect
their results curiously await in the yet unseen worldcounterparts
of what accrued to them in the seen world
i suspect i shall meet them there,
i suspect i shall there find each old particular of those unnamed lands
similitude

on the beach at night alone,
as the old mother sways her to and fro, singing her savage and husky song,
as i watch the bright stars shiningi think a thought of the clef of the
universes, and of the future

a vast similitude interlocks all,
all spheres, grown, ungrown, small, large, suns, moons, planets, comets,
asteroids,
all the substances of the same, and all that is spiritual upon the same,
all distances of place, however wide,
all distances of timeall inanimate forms,
all soulsall living bodies, though they be ever so different, or in
different worlds,
all gaseous, watery, vegetable, mineral processesthe fishes, the brutes,
all men and womenme also
all nations, colours, barbarisms, civilisations, languages
all identities that have existed, or may exist, on this globe, or any
globe
all lives and deathsall of the past, present, future
this vast similitude spans them, and always has spanned, and shall for ever
span them, and compactly hold them

aloof, dissatisfied, plotting revolt,
comrade of criminals, brother of slaves,
crafty, despised, a drudge, ignorant,
with sudra face and worn browblack, but in the depths of my heart proud
as any

morose, full of guile, full of reminiscences, brooding, with many wiles,

sanctus spiritus, which is right, instead of santa spirita, which is
methodically wrong
songs of parting
singers and poets

the indications and tally of time
perfect sanity shows the master among philosophs
time, always without flaw, indicates itself in parts
what always indicates the poet is the crowd of the pleasant company of
singers, and their words
the words of the singers are the hours or minutes of the light or darkbut
the words of the maker of poems are the general light and dark
the maker of poems settles justice, reality, immortality,
his insight and power encircle things and the human race,
he is the glory and extract, thus far, of things and of the human race

the singers do not begetonly the poet begets
the singers are welcomed, understood, appear often enoughbut rare has the
day been, likewise the spot, of the birth of the maker of poems
not every century, or every five centuries, has contained such a day, for
all its names
the singers of successive hours of centuries may have ostensible names, but
the name of each of them is one of the singers
the name of each is eyesinger, earsinger, headsinger,
sweetsinger, echosinger, parloursinger, lovesinger, or something else

all this time, and at all times, wait the words of poems
the greatness of sons is the exuding of the greatness of mothers and
fathers
the words of poems are the tuft and final applause of science
divine instinct, breadth of vision, the law of reason, health, rudeness of
body, withdrawnness, gaiety, suntan, airsweetnesssuch are some
of the words of poems

the sailor and traveller underlie the maker of poems,
the builder, geometer, chemist, anatomist, phrenologist, artistall these
underlie the maker of poems

the words of the true poems give you more than poems,
they give you, to form for yourself, poems, religions, politics, war,
peace, behaviour, histories, essays, romances, and everything else,
they balance ranks, colours, races, creeds, and the sexes,
they do not seek beautythey are sought,
for ever touching them, or close upon them, follows beauty, longing, fain,
lovesick
they prepare for deathyet are they not the finish, but rather the outset,
they bring none to his or her terminus, or to be content and full
whom they take, they take into space, to behold the birth of stars, to
learn one of the meanings,
to launch off with absolute faithto sweep through the ceaseless rings,
and never be quiet again
to a historian
you who celebrate bygones
who have explored the outward, the surfaces of the racesthe life that has
exhibited itself
who have treated of man as the creature of politics, aggregates, rulers,
and priests
i, habitu of the alleghanies, treating man as he is in himself, in his own
rights,
pressing the pulse of the life that has seldom exhibited itself, the great
pride of man in himself
chanter of personality, outlining what is yet to be
i project the history of the future
fit audience

whoever you are, holding me now in hand,
without one thing, all will be useless
i give you fair warning, before you attempt me further,
i am not what you supposed, but far different

who is he that would become my follower?
who would sign himself a candidate for my affections?
the way is suspiciousthe result uncertain, perhaps destructive
you would have to give up all elsei alone would expect to be your god,
sole and exclusive
your novitiate would even then be long and exhausting,
the whole past theory of your life, and all conformity to the lives around
you, would have to be abandoned
therefore release me now, before troubling yourself any furtherlet go
your hand from my shoulders,
put me down, and depart on your way
or else, by stealth, in some wood, for trial,
or back of a rock, in the open air,
for in any roofed room of a house i emerge notnor in company,
and in libraries i lie as one dumb, a gawk, or unborn, or dead,
but just possibly with you on a high hillfirst watching lest any person,
for miles around, approach unawares
or possibly with you sailing at sea, or on the beach of the sea, or some
quiet island,
here to put your lips upon mine i permit you,
with the comrades longdwelling kiss, or the new husbands kiss,
for i am the new husband, and i am the comrade
or, if you will, thrusting me beneath your clothing,
where i may feel the throbs of your heart, or rest upon your hip,
carry me when you go forth over land or sea
for thus, merely touching you, is enoughis best,
and thus, touching you, would i silently sleep, and be carried eternally

but these leaves conning, you con at peril,
for these leaves, and me, you will not understand,
they will elude you at first, and still more afterwardi will certainly
elude you,
even while you should think you had unquestionably caught me, behold
already you see i have escaped from you
for it is not for what i have put into it that i have written this book,
nor is it by reading it you will acquire it,
nor do those know me best who admire me, and vauntingly praise me,
nor will the candidates for my love unless at most a very few prove
victorious,
nor will my poems do good onlythey will do just as much evil, perhaps
more
for all is useless without that which you may guess at many times and not
hitthat which i hinted at
therefore release me, and depart on your way
singing in spring
these i, singing in spring, collect for lovers
for who but i should understand lovers, and all their sorrow and joy?
and who but i should be the poet of comrades?
collecting, i traverse the garden, the worldbut soon i pass the gates,
now along the pondsidenow wading in a little, fearing not the wet,
now by the postandrail fences, where the old stones thrown there, picked
from the fields, have accumulated,
wild flowers and vines and weeds come up through the stones, and partly
cover thembeyond these i pass,
far, far in the forest, before i think where i go,
solitary, smelling the earthy smell, stopping now and then in the silence
alone, i had thoughtyet soon a silent troop gathers around me
some walk by my side, and some behind, and some embrace my arms or neck,
they, the spirits of friends, dead or alivethicker they come, a great
crowd, and i in the middle,
collecting, dispensing, singing in spring, there i wander with them,
plucking something for tokenstossing toward whoever is near me
here lilac, with a branch of pine,
here, out of my pocket, some moss which i pulled off a liveoak in florida,
as it hung trailing down,
here some pinks and laurel leaves, and a handful of sage,
and here what i now draw from the water, wading in the pondside,
o here i last saw him that tenderly loves meand returns again, never to
separate from me,
and this, o this shall henceforth be the token of comradesthis calamus
root shall,
interchange it, youths, with each other let none render it back
and twigs of maple, and a bunch of wild orange, and chestnut,
and stems of currants, and plumblows, and the aromatic cedar,
these i, compassed around by a thick cloud of spirits,
wandering, point to, or touch as i pass, or throw them loosely from me,
indicating to each one what he shall havegiving something to each
but what i drew from the water by the pondside, that i reserve
i will give of itbut only to them that love as i myself am capable of
loving
footnote  i am favoured with the following indication, from mr whitman
himself, of the relation in which this word calamus is to be
understoodcalamus is the very large and aromatic grass or rush growing
about waterponds in the valleysspears about three feet high often
called sweet flag grows all over the northern and middle states the
recherch or ethereal sense of the term, as used in my book, arises
probably from the actual calamus presenting the biggest and hardiest kind
of spears of grass, and their fresh, aquatic, pungent bouquet
love of comrades

come, i will make the continent indissoluble
i will make the most splendid race the sun ever yet shone upon
i will make divine magnetic lands,
with the love of comrades,
with the lifelong love of comrades

i will plant companionship thick as trees along all the rivers of america,
and along the shores of the great lakes, and all over the prairies
i will make inseparable cities, with their arms about each others necks
by the love of comrades,
by the manly love of comrades

for you these, from me, o democracy, to serve you, ma femme
for you for you, i am trilling these songs,
in the love of comrades,
in the hightowering love of comrades
pulse of my life
not heaving from my ribbed breast only
not in sighs at night, in rage, dissatisfied with myself
not in those longdrawn, illsuppressed sighs
not in many an oath and promise broken
not in my wilful and savage souls volition
not in the subtle nourishment of the air
not in this beating and pounding at my temples and wrists
not in the curious systole and diastole within, which will one day cease
not in many a hungry wish, told to the skies only
not in cries, laughter, defiances, thrown from me when alone, far in the
wilds
not in husky pantings through clenched teeth
not in sounded and resounded wordschattering words, echoes, dead words
not in the murmurs of my dreams while i sleep,
nor the other murmurs of these incredible dreams of every day
nor in the limbs and senses of my body, that take you and dismiss you
continuallynot there
not in any or all of them, o adhesiveness o pulse of my life
need i that you exist and show yourself, any more than in these songs
auxiliaries
what place is besieged, and vainly tries to raise the siege?
lo i send to that place a commander, swift, brave, immortal
and with him horse and foot, and parks of artillery,
and artillerymen, the deadliest that ever fired gun
realities

as i walk, solitary, unattended,
around me i hear that clat of the worldpolitics, produce,
the announcements of recognised thingsscience,
the approved growth of cities, and the spread of inventions
i see the ships, they will last a few years,
the vast factories, with their foremen and workmen,
and hear the endorsement of all, and do not object to it

but i too announce solid things
science, ships, politics, cities, factories, are not nothingthey serve,
they stand for realitiesall is as it should be

then my realities
what else is so real as mine?
libertad, and the divine averagefreedom to every slave on the face of the
earth,
the rapt promises and lumin of seersthe spiritual
worldthese centurieslasting songs,
and our visions, the visions of poets, the most solid announcements of any
for we support all,
after the rest is done and gone, we remain,
there is no final reliance but upon us
democracy rests finally upon us, i, my brethren, begin it,
and our visions sweep through eternity
footnote  i suppose whitman gets this odd word lumin, by a process of
his own, out of illuminati, and intends it to stand for what would be
called clairvoyance, intuition
nearing departure

as nearing departure,
as the time draws nigh, glooming, a cloud,
a dread beyond, of i know not what, darkens me

i shall go forth,
i shall traverse the statesbut i cannot tell whither or how long
perhaps soon, some day or night while i am singing, my voice will suddenly
cease

o book and chant must all then amount to but this?
must we barely arrive at this beginning of me?
and yet it is enough, o soul
o soul we have positively appearedthat is enough
poets to come

poets to come
not today is to justify me, and democracy, and what we are for
but you, a new brood, native, athletic, continental, greater than before
known,
you must justify me

i but write one or two indicative words for the future,
i but advance a moment, only to wheel and hurry back in the darkness
i am a man who, sauntering along, without fully stopping, turns a casual
look upon you, and then averts his face,
leaving it to you to prove and define it,
expecting the main things from you
centuries hence
full of life now, compact, visible,
i, forty years old the eightythird year of the states,
to one a century hence, or any number of centuries hence,
to you, yet unborn, these seeking you
when you read these, i, that was visible, am become invisible
now it is you, compact, visible, realising my poems, seeking me
fancying how happy you were, if i could be with you, and become your loving
comrade
be it as if i were with you be not too certain but i am now with you
so long

to concludei announce what comes after me
i announce mightier offspring, orators, days, and then depart,
i remember i said, before my leaves sprang at all,
i would raise my voice jocund and strong, with reference to consummations
when america does what was promised,
when there are plentiful athletic bards, inland and seaboard,
when through these states walk a hundred millions of superb persons,
when the rest part away for superb persons, and contribute to them,
when breeds of the most perfect mothers denote america,
then to me my due fruition
i have pressed through in my own right,
i have offered my style to every onei have journeyed with confident step
while my pleasure is yet at the full, i whisper, so long
and take the young womans hand, and the young mans hand for the last
time

i announce natural persons to arise,
i announce justice triumphant,
i announce uncompromising liberty and equality,
i announce the justification of candour, and the justification of pride
i announce that the identity of these states is a single identity only,
i announce the union, out of all its struggles and wars, more and more
compact,
i announce splendours and majesties to make all the previous politics of
the earth insignificant
i announce a man or woman comingperhaps you are the one so long
i announce the great individual, fluid as nature, chaste, affectionate,
compassionate, fully armed
i announce a life that shall be copious, vehement, spiritual, bold,
and i announce an old age that shall lightly and joyfully meet its
translation

o thicker and faster so long
o crowding too close upon me
i foresee too muchit means more than i thought,
it appears to me i am dying
hasten throat, and sound your last
salute mesalute the days once more peal the old cry once more
screaming electric, the atmosphere using,
at random glancing, each as i notice absorbing,
swiftly on, but a little while alighting,
curious enveloped messages delivering,
sparkles hot, seed ethereal, down in the dirt dropping,
myself unknowing, my commission obeying, to question it never daring,
to ages, and ages yet, the growth of the seed leaving,
to troops out of me risingthey the tasks i have set promulging,
to women certain whispers of myself bequeathingtheir affection me more
clearly explaining,
to young men my problems offeringno dallier ii the muscle of their
brains trying,
so i passa little time vocal, visible, contrary,
afterward, a melodious echo, passionately bent fordeath making me really
undying,
the best of me then when no longer visiblefor toward that i have been
incessantly preparing
what is there more, that i lag and pause, and crouch extended with unshut
mouth?
is there a single final farewell?

my songs ceasei abandon them,
from behind the screen where i hid, i advance personally, solely to you
camerado this is no book
who touches this touches a man
is it night? are we here alone?
it is i you hold, and who holds you,
i spring from the pages into your armsdecease calls me forth
o how your fingers drowse me
your breath falls around me like dewyour pulse lulls the tympans of my
ears,
i feel immerged from head to foot,
deliciousenough
enough, o deed impromptu and secret
enough, o gliding present enough, o summedup past

dear friend, whoever you are, here, take this kiss,
i give it especially to youdo not forget me,
i feel like one who has done his worki progress on,long enough have i
dallied with life,
the unknown sphere, more real than i dreamed, more direct, awakening rays
about meso long
remember my wordsi love youi depart from materials,
i am as one disembodied, triumphant, dead
