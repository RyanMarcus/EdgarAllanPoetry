i do not love you as if you were salt-rose, or topaz,
or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off
i love you as certain dark things are to be loved,
in secret, between the shadow and the soul
i love you as the plant that never blooms
but carries in itself the light of hidden flowers
thanks to your love a certain solid fragrance,
risen from the earth, lives darkly in my body
i love you without knowing how, or when, or from where
i love you straightforwardly, without complexities or pride
so i love you because i know no other way
than this where i does not exist, nor you,
so close that your hand on my chest is my hand,
so close that your eyes close as i fall asleep
i want you to know
one thing
you know how this is
if i look
at the crystal moon, at the red branch
of the slow autumn at my window,
if i touch
near the fire
the impalpable ash
or the wrinkled body of the log,
everything carries me to you,
as if everything that exists,
aromas, light, metals,
were little boats
that sail
toward those isles of yours that wait for me
well, now,
if little by little you stop loving me
i shall stop loving you little by little
if suddenly
you forget me
do not look for me,
for i shall already have forgotten you
if you think it long and mad,
the wind of banners
that passes through my life,
and you decide
to leave me at the shore
of the heart where i have roots,
remember
that on that day,
at that hour,
i shall lift my arms
and my roots will set off
to seek another land
but
if each day,
each hour,
you feel that you are destined for me
with implacable sweetness,
if each day a flower
climbs up to your lips to seek me,
ah my love, ah my own,
in me all that fire is repeated,
in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten,
my love feeds on your love, beloved,
and as long as you live it will be in your arms
without leaving mine
i crave your mouth, your voice, your hair
silent and starving, i prowl through the streets
bread does not nourish me, dawn disrupts me, all day
i hunt for the liquid measure of your steps
i hunger for your sleek laugh,
your hands the color of a savage harvest,
hunger for the pale stones of your fingernails,
i want to eat your skin like a whole almond
i want to eat the sunbeam flaring in your lovely body,
the sovereign nose of your arrogant face,
i want to eat the fleeting shade of your lashes,
and i pace around hungry, sniffing the twilight,
hunting for you, for your hot heart,
like a puma in the barrens of quitratue
every day you play with the light of the universe
subtle visitor, you arrive in the flower and the water,
you are more than this white head that i hold tightly
as a bunch of flowers, every day, between my hands
you are like nobody since i love you
let me spread you out among yellow garlands
who writes your name in letters of smoke among the stars of the south?
oh let me remember you as you were before you existed
suddenly the wind howls and bangs at my shut window
the sky is a net crammed with shadowy fish
here all the winds let go sooner or later, all of them
the rain takes off her clothes
the birds go by, fleeing
the wind  the wind
i alone can contend against the power of men
the storm whirls dark leaves
and turns loose all the boats that were moored last night to the sky
you are here  oh, you do not run away
you will answer me to the last cry
curl round me as though you were frightened
even so, a strange shadow once ran through your eyes
now, now too, little one, you bring me honeysuckle,
and even your breasts smell of it
while the sad wind goes slaughtering butterflies
i love you, and my happiness bites the plum of your mouth
how you must have suffered getting accustomed to me,
my savage, solitary soul, my name that sends them all running
so many times we have seen the morning star burn, kissing our eyes,
and over our heads the grey light unwinds in turning fans
my words rained over you, stroking you
a long time i have loved the sunned mother-of-pearl of your body
until i even believe that you own the universe
i will bring you happy flowers from the mountains, bluebells, dark hazels, and rustic baskets of kisses
i want to do with you what spring does with the cherry trees
body of a woman, white hills, white thighs,
you look like a world, lying in surrender
my rough peasants body digs in you
and makes the son leap from the depth of the earth
i was lone like a tunnel the birds fled from me,
and nigh swamped me with its crushing invasion
to survive myself i forged you like a weapon,
like an arrow in my bow, a stone in my sling
but the hour of vengeance falls, and i love you
body of skin, of moss, of eager and firm milk
oh the goblets of the breast oh the eyes of absence
oh the roses of the pubis oh your voice, slow and sad
body of my woman, i will persist in your grace
my thirst, my boundless desire, my shifting road
dark river-beds where the eternal thirst flows
and weariness follows, and the infinite ache
drunk as drunk on turpentine
from your open kisses,
your wet body wedged
between my wet body and the strake
of our boat that is made of flowers,
feasted, we guide it - our fingers
like tallows adorned with yellow metal -
over the skys hot rim,
the days last breath in our sails
pinned by the sun between solstice
and equinox, drowsy and tangled together
we drifted for months and woke
with the bitter taste of land on our lips,
eyelids all sticky, and we longed for lime
and the sound of a rope
lowering a bucket down its well then,
we came by night to the fortunate isles,
and lay like fish
under the net of our kisses
i like for you to be still
it is as though you are absent
and you hear me from far away
and my voice does not touch you
it seems as though your eyes had flown away
and it seems that a kiss had sealed your mouth
as all things are filled with my soul
you emerge from the things
filled with my soul
you are like my soul
a butterfly of dream
and you are like the word melancholy
i like for you to be still
and you seem far away
it sounds as though you are lamenting
a butterfly cooing like a dove
and you hear me from far away
and my voice does not reach you
let me come to be still in your silence
and let me talk to you with your silence
that is bright as a lamp
simple, as a ring
you are like the night
with its stillness and constellations
your silence is that of a star
as remote and candid
i like for you to be still
it is as though you are absent
distant and full of sorrow
so you wouldve died
one word then, one smile is enough
and im happy
happy that its not true
i do not love you except because i love you
i go from loving to not loving you,
from waiting to not waiting for you
my heart moves from cold to fire
i love you only because its you the one i love
i hate you deeply, and hating you
bend to you, and the measure of my changing love for you
is that i do not see you but love you blindly
maybe january light will consume
my heart with its cruel
ray, stealing my key to true calm
in this part of the story i am the one who
dies, the only one, and i will die of love because i love you,
because i love you, love, in fire and blood
my love, if you die and i dont--,
lets not give grief an even greater field
no expanse is greater than where we live
dust in the wheat, sand in the deserts,
time, wandering water, the vague wind
swept us like sailing seeds
we might not have found one another in time
this meadow where we find ourselves,
o little infinity we give it back
but love, this love has not ended
just as it never had a birth, it has
no death it is like a long river,
only changing lands, and changing lips
when i cannot look at your face
i look at your feet
your feet of arched bone,
your hard little feet
i know that they support you,
and that your sweet weight
rises upon them
your waist and your breasts,
the doubled purple
of your nipples,
the sockets of your eyes
that have just flown away,
your wide fruit mouth,
your red tresses,
my little tower
but i love your feet
only because they walked
upon the earth and upon
the wind and upon the waters,
until they found me
i am not jealous
of what came before me
come with a man
on your shoulders,
come with a hundred men in your hair,
come with a thousand men between your breasts and your feet,
come like a river
full of drowned men
which flows down to the wild sea,
to the eternal surf, to time
bring them all
to where i am waiting for you
we shall always be alone,
we shall always be you and i
alone on earth
to start our life
i can write the saddest poem of all tonight
write, for instance the night is full of stars,
and the stars, blue, shiver in the distance
the night wind whirls in the sky and sings
i can write the saddest poem of all tonight
i loved her, and sometimes she loved me too
on nights like this, i held her in my arms
i kissed her so many times under the infinite sky
she loved me, sometimes i loved her
how could i not have loved her large, still eyes?
i can write the saddest poem of all tonight
to think i dont have her to feel that ive lost her
to hear the immense night, more immense without her
and the poem falls to the soul as dew to grass
what does it matter that my love couldnt keep her
the night is full of stars and she is not with me
thats all far away, someone sings far away
my soul is lost without her
as if to bring her near, my eyes search for her
my heart searches for her and she is not with me
the same night that whitens the same trees
we, we who were, we are the same no longer
i no longer love her, true, but how much i loved her
my voice searched the wind to touch her ear
someone elses she will be someone elses as she once
belonged to my kisses
her voice, her light body her infinite eyes
i no longer love her, true, but perhaps i love her
love is so short and oblivion so long
because on nights like this i held her in my arms,
my soul is lost without her
although this may be the last pain she causes me,
and this may be the last poem i write for her
dont go far off, not even for a day
dont go far off, not even for a day,
because i dont know how to say it - a day is long
and i will be waiting for you, as in
an empty station when the trains are
parked off somewhere else, asleep
dont leave me, even for an hour, because then
the little drops of anguish will all run together,
the smoke that roams looking for a home will drift
into me, choking my lost heart
oh, may your silhouette never dissolve
on the beach, may your eyelids never flutter
into the empty distance dont leave me for
a second, my dearest, because in that moment youll
have gone so far ill wander mazily
over all the earth, asking, will you
come back? will you leave me here, dying?
naked you are simple as one of your hands
smooth, earthy, small, transparent, round
youve moon-lines, apple pathways
naked you are slender as a naked grain of wheat
naked you are blue as a night in cuba
youve vines and stars in your hair
naked you are spacious and yellow
as summer in a golden church
naked you are tiny as one of your nails
curved, subtle, rosy, till the day is born
and you withdraw to the underground world
as if down a long tunnel of clothing and of chores
your clear light dims, gets dressed, drops its leaves,
and becomes a naked hand again
tonight i can write the saddest lines
write, for example, the night is starry
and the stars are blue and shiver in the distance
the night wind revolves in the sky and sings
tonight i can write the saddest lines
i loved her, and sometimes she loved me too
through nights like this one i held her in my arms
i kissed her again and again under the endless sky
she loved me, sometimes i loved her too
how could one not have loved her great still eyes
tonight i can write the saddest lines
to think that i do not have her to feel that i have lost her
to hear the immense night, still more immense without her
and the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture
what does it matter that my love could not keep her
the night is starry and she is not with me
this is all in the distance someone is singing in the distance
my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her
my sight tries to find her as though to bring her closer
my heart looks for her, and she is not with me
the same night whitening the same trees
we, of that time, are no longer the same
i no longer love her, thats certain, but how i loved her
my voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing
anothers she will be anothers as she was before my kisses
her voice, her bright body her infinite eyes
i no longer love her, thats certain, but maybe i love her
love is so short, forgetting is so long
because through nights like this one i held her in my arms
my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her
though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer
and these the last verses that i write for her
whats wrong with you, with us,
whats happening to us?
ah our love is a harsh cord
that binds us wounding us
and if we want
to leave our wound,
to separate,
it makes a new knot for us and condemns us
to drain our blood and burn together
whats wrong with you? i look at you
and i find nothing in you but two eyes
like all eyes, a mouth
lost among a thousand mouths that i have kissed, more beautiful,
a body just like those that have slipped
beneath my body without leaving any memory
and how empty you went through the world
like a wheat-colored jar
without air, without sound, without substance
i vainly sought in you
depth for my arms
that dig, without cease, beneath the earth
beneath your skin, beneath your eyes,
nothing,
beneath your double breast scarcely
raised
a current of crystalline order
that does not know why it flows singing
why, why, why,
my love, why?
ah vastness of pines, murmur of waves breaking,
slow play of lights, solitary bell,
twilight falling in your eyes, toy doll,
earth-shell, in whom the earth sings
in you the rivers sing and my soul flees in them
as you desire, and you send it where you will
aim my road on your bow of hope
and in a frenzy i will flee my flock of arrows
on all sides i see your waist of fog,
and your silence hunts down my afflicted hours
my kisses anchor, and my moist desire nests
in your arms of transparent stone
ah your mysterious voice that love tolls and darkens
in the resonant and dying evening
thus in the deep hours i have seen, over the fields,
the ears of wheat tolling in the mouth of the wind
you are the daughter of the sea, oreganos first cousin
swimmer, your body is pure as the water
cook, your blood is quick as the soil
everything you do is full of flowers, rich with the earth
your eyes go out toward the water, and the waves rise
your hands go out to the earth and the seeds swell
you know the deep essence of water and the earth,
conjoined in you like a formula for clay
naiad cut your body into turquoise pieces,
they will bloom resurrected in the kitchen
this is how you become everything that lives
and so at last, you sleep, in the circle of my arms
that push back the shadows so that you can rest--
vegetables, seaweed, herbs the foam of your dreams
i dont love you as if you were the salt-rose, topaz
or arrow of carnations that propagate fire
i love you as certain dark things are loved,
secretly, between the shadow and the soul
i love you as the plant that doesnt bloom and carries
hidden within itself the light of those flowers,
and thanks to your love, darkly in my body
lives the dense fragrance that rises from the earth
i love you without knowing how, or when, or from where,
i love you simply, without problems or pride
i love you in this way because i dont know any other way of loving
but this, in which there is no i or you,
so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand,
so intimate that when i fall asleep it is your eyes that close
the light wraps you in its mortal flame
abstracted pale mourner, standing that way
against the old propellers of the twighlight
that revolves around you
speechless, my friend,
alone in the loneliness of this hour of the dead
and filled with the lives of fire,
pure heir of the ruined day
a bough of fruit falls from the sun on your dark garment
the great roots of night
grow suddenly from your soul,
and the things that hide in you come out again
so that a blue and palled people
your newly born, takes nourishment
oh magnificent and fecund and magnetic slave
of the circle that moves in turn through black and gold
rise, lead and possess a creation
so rich in life that its flowers perish
and it is full of sadness
dont go far off, not even for a day, because --
because -- i dont know how to say it a day is long
and i will be waiting for you, as in an empty station
when the trains are parked off somewhere else, asleep
dont leave me, even for an hour, because
then the little drops of anguish will all run together,
the smoke that roams looking for a home will drift
into me, choking my lost heart
oh, may your silhouette never dissolve on the beach
may your eyelids never flutter into the empty distance
dont leave me for a second, my dearest,
because in that moment youll have gone so far
ill wander mazily over all the earth, asking,
will you come back? will you leave me here, dying?
so that you will hear me
my words
sometimes grow thin
as the tracks of the gulls on the beaches
necklace, drunken bell
for your hands smooth as grapes
and i watch my words from a long way off
they are more yours than mine
they climb on my old suffering like ivy
it climbs the same way on damp walls
you are to blame for this cruel sport
they are fleeing from my dark lair
you fill everything, you fill everything
before you they peopled the solitude that you occupy,
and they are more used to my sadness than you are
now i want them to say what i want to say to you
to make you hear as i want you to hear me
the wind of anguish still hauls on them as usual
sometimes hurricanes of dreams still knock them over
you listen to other voices in my painful voice
lament of old mouths, blood of old supplications
love me, companion dont forsake me follow me
follow me, companion, on this wave of anguish
but my words become stained with your love
you occupy everything, you occupy everything
i am making them into an endless necklace
for your white hands, smooth as grapes
so that you will hear me
my words
sometimes grow thin
as the tracks of the gulls on the beaches
necklace, drunken bell
for your hands smooth as grapes
and i watch my words from a long way off
they are more yours than mine
they climb on my old suffering like ivy
it climbs the same way on damp walls
you are to blame for this cruel sport
they are fleeing from my dark lair
you fill everything, you fill everything
before you they peopled the solitude that you occupy,
and they are more used to my sadness than you are
now i want them to say what i want to say to you
to make you hear as i want you to hear me
the wind of anguish still hauls on them as usual
sometimes hurricanes of dreams still knock them over
you listen to other voices in my painful voice
lament of old mouths, blood of old supplications
love me, companion dont forsake me follow me
follow me, companion, on this wave of anguish
but my words become stained with your love
you occupy everything, you occupy everything
i am making them into an endless necklace
for your white hands, smooth as grapes
it was the twilight of the iguana
from the rainbow-arch of the battlements,
his long tongue like a lance
sank down in the green leaves,
and a swarm of ants, monks with feet chanting,
crawled off into the jungle,
the guanaco, thin as oxygen
in the wide peaks of cloud,
went along, wearing his shoes of gold,
while the llama opened his honest eyes
on the breakable neatness
of a world full of dew
the monkeys braided a sexual
thread that went on and on
along the shores of dawn,
demolishing walls of pollen
and startling the butterflies of muzo
into flying violets
it was the night of the alligators,
the pure night, crawling
with snouts emrging from ooze,
and out the sleepy marshes
the confused noise of scaly plates
returned to the ground where they began
the jaguar brushed the leaves
with a luminous absence,
the puma runs through the branches
like a forest fire,
while the jungles drunken eyes
burn from inside him
the badgers scratch the rivers
feet, scenting the nest
whost throbbing delicacy
they attack with red teeth
and deep in the huge waters
the enormous anaconda lies
like the circle around the earth,
covered with ceremonies of mud,
devouring, religious
leaning into the afternoons,
i cast my sad nets towards your oceanic eyes
there, in the highest blaze my solitude lengthens and flames
its arms turning like a drowning mans
i send out red signals across your absent eyes
that wave like the sea, or the beach by a lighthouse
you keep only darkness my distant female
from your regard sometimes, the coast of dread emerges
leaning into the afternoons,
i fling my sad nets to that sea that is thrashed
by your oceanic eyes
the birds of night peck at the first stars
that flash like my soul when i love you
the night, gallops on its shadowy mare
shedding blue tassels over the land
leaning into the afternoons,
i cast my sad nets towards your oceanic eyes
there, in the highest blaze my solitude lengthens and flames
its arms turning like a drowning mans
i send out red signals across your absent eyes
that wave like the sea, or the beach by a lighthouse
you keep only darkness my distant female
from your regard sometimes, the coast of dread emerges
leaning into the afternoons,
i fling my sad nets to that sea that is thrashed
by your oceanic eyes
the birds of night peck at the first stars
that flash like my soul when i love you
the night, gallops on its shadowy mare
shedding blue tassels over the land
leaning into the afternoons,
i cast my sad nets towards your oceanic eyes
there, in the highest blaze my solitude lengthens and flames
its arms turning like a drowning mans
i send out red signals across your absent eyes
that wave like the sea, or the beach by a lighthouse
you keep only darkness my distant female
from your regard sometimes, the coast of dread emerges
leaning into the afternoons,
i fling my sad nets to that sea that is thrashed
by your oceanic eyes
the birds of night peck at the first stars
that flash like my soul when i love you
the night, gallops on its shadowy mare
shedding blue tassels over the land
the artichoke
of delicate heart
erect
in its battle-dress, builds
its minimal cupola
keeps
stark
in its scallop of
scales
around it,
demoniac vegetables
bristle their thicknesses,
devise
tendrils and belfries,
the bulbs agitations
while under the subsoil
the carrot
sleeps sound in its
rusty mustaches
runner and filaments
bleach in the vineyards,
whereon rise the vines
the sedulous cabbage
arranges its petticoats
oregano
sweetens a world
and the artichoke
dulcetly there in a gardenplot,
armed for a skirmish,
goes proud
in its pomegranate
burnishes
till, on a day,
each by the other,
the artichoke moves
to its dream
of a market place
in the big willow
hoppers
a battle formation
most warlike
of defilades-
with men
in the market stalls,
white shirts
in the soup-greens,
artichoke field marshals,
close-order conclaves,
commands, detonations,
and voices,
a crashing of crate staves
and
maria
come
down
with her hamper
to
make trial
of an artichoke
she reflects, she examines,
she candles them up to the light like an egg,
never flinching
she bargains,
she tumbles her prize
in a market bag
among shoes and a
cabbage head,
a bottle
of vinegar is back
in her kitchen
the artichoke drowns in a pot
so you have it
a vegetable, armed,
a profession
call it an artichoke
whose end
is millennial
we taste of that
sweetness,
dismembering scale after scale
we eat of a halcyon paste
it is green at the artichoke heart
ode to a lemon
out of lemon flowers
loosed
on the moonlight, loves
lashed and insatiable
essences,
sodden with fragrance,
the lemon trees yellow
emerges,
the lemons
move down
from the trees planetarium
delicate merchandise
the harbors are big with it-
bazaars
for the light and the
barbarous gold
we open
the halves
of a miracle,
and a clotting of acids
brims
into the starry
divisions
creations
original juices,
irreducible, changeless,
alive
so the freshness lives on
in a lemon,
in the sweet-smelling house of the rind,
the proportions, arcane and acerb
cutting the lemon
the knife
leaves a little cathedral
alcoves unguessed by the eye
that open acidulous glass
to the light topazes
riding the droplets,
altars,
aromatic facades
so, while the hand
holds the cut of the lemon,
half a world
on a trencher,
the gold of the universe
wells
to your touch
a cup yellow
with miracles,
a breast and a nipple
perfuming the earth
a flashing made fruitage,
the diminutive fire of a planet
