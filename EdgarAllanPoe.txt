the raven
once upon a midnight dreary, while i pondered, weak and weary,
over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore
while i nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
as of some one gently rappingrapping at my chamber door
tis some visitor, i muttered, tapping at my chamber door
only this and nothing more
ah, distinctly i remember, it was in the bleak december,
and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
eagerly i wished the morrowvainly i had sought to borrow
from my books surcease of sorrowsorrow for the lost lenore
for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore
nameless here for evermore
and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
thrilled mefilled me with fantastic terrors never felt before
so that now, to still the beating of my heart, i stood repeating
tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door
some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door
this it is and nothing more
presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer,
sir, said i, or madam, truly your forgiveness i implore
but the fact is i was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
and so faintly you came tappingtapping at my chamber door,
that i scarce was sure i heard youhere i opened wide the door
darkness there and nothing more
deep into that darkness peering, long i stood there wondering,
fearing,
doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before
but the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,
and the only word there spoken was the whispered word, lenore
this i whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, lenore
merely this and nothing more
back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
soon i heard again a tapping, somewhat louder than before
surely, said i, surely that is something at my window lattice
let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore
let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore
tis the wind and nothing more
open here i flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore
not the least obeisance made he not an instant stopped or stayed he
but, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door
perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door
perched, and sat, and nothing more
then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou, i said, art sure no
craven,
ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore
tell me what thy lordly name is on the nights plutonian shore
quoth the raven, nevermore
much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
though its answer little meaninglittle relevancy bore
for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door
bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
with such name as nevermore
but the raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only
that one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour
nothing further then he utterednot a feather then he fluttered
till i scarcely more than muttered, other friends have flown before
on the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before
then the bird said, nevermore
startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
doubtless, said i, what it utters is its only stock and store,
caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster
followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore
till the dirges of his hope the melancholy burden bore
of nevernevermore
but the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and
door
then, upon the velvet sinking, i betook myself to linking
fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore
what this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
meant in croaking nevermore
this i sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms core
this and more i sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
on the cushions velvet lining that the lamplight gloated oer,
but whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating oer,
she shall press, ah, nevermore
then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
swung by seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor
wretch, i cried, thy god hath lent theeby these angels he hath
sent thee
respiterespite aad nepenth from thy memories of lenore
quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenth, and forget this lost lenore
quoth the raven, nevermore
prophet said i, thing of evilprophet still, if bird or devil
whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted
on this home by horror hauntedtell me truly, i implore
is thereis there balm in gilead?tell metell me, i implore
quoth the raven, nevermore
prophet said i, thing of evilprophet still, if bird or devil
by that heaven that bends above usby that god we both adore
tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant aidenn,
it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore
clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore
quoth the raven, nevermore
be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend i shrieked,
upstarting
get thee back into the tempest and the nights plutonian shore
leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken
leave my loneliness unbrokenquit the bust above my door
take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door
quoth the raven, nevermore
and the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door
and his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming,
and the lamplight oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor
and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
shall be liftednevermore

the bells,
i
hear the sledges with the bells
silver bells
what a world of merriment their melody foretells
how they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,
in their icy air of night
while the stars, that oversprinkle
all the heavens, seem to twinkle
with a crystalline delight
keeping time, time, time,
in a sort of runic rhyme,
to the tintinnabulation that so musically wells
from the bells, bells, bells, bells,
bells, bells, bells
from the jingling and the tinkling of the bells
ii
hear the mellow wedding bells,
golden bells
what a world of happiness their harmony foretells
through the balmy air of night
how they ring out their delight
from the molten goldennotes,
and all in tune,
what a liquid ditty floats
to the turtledove that listens, while she gloats
on the moon
oh, from out the sounding cells,
what a gush of euphony voluminously wells
how it swells
how it dwells
on the future how it tells
of the rapture that impels
to the swinging and the ringing
of the bells, bells, bells,
of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
bells, bells, bells
to the rhyming and the chiming of the bells
iii
hear the loud alarum bells
brazen bells
what a tale of terror now their turbulency tells
in the startled ear of night
how they scream out their affright
too much horrified to speak,
they can only shriek, shriek,
out of tune,
in a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,
in a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire
leaping higher, higher, higher,
with a desperate desire,
and a resolute endeavor
nownow to sit or never,
by the side of the palefaced moon
oh, the bells, bells, bells
what a tale their terror tells
of despair
how they clang, and clash, and roar
what a horror they outpour
on the bosom of the palpitating air
yet the ear it fully knows,
by the twanging,
and the clanging,
how the danger ebbs and flows
yet the ear distinctly tells,
in the jangling,
and the wrangling,
how the danger sinks and swells,
by the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells
of the bells
of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
bells, bells, bells
in the clamor and the clangor of the bells
iv
hear the tolling of the bells
iron bells
what a world of solemn thought their monody compels
in the silence of the night,
how we shiver with affright
at the melancholy menace of their tone
for every sound that floats
from the rust within their throats
is a groan
and the peopleah, the people
they that dwell up in the steeple
all alone,
and who toiling, toiling, toiling,
in that muffled monotone,
feel a glory in so rolling
on the human heart a stone
they are neither man nor woman
they are neither brute nor human
they are ghouls
and their king it is who tolls
and he rolls, rolls, rolls,
rolls
a pan from the bells
and his merry bosom swells
with the pan of the bells
and he dances, and he yells
keeping time, time, time,
in a sort of runic rhyme,
to the pan of the bells
of the bells
keeping time, time, time,
in a sort of runic rhyme,
to the throbbing of the bells
of the bells, bells, bells
to the sobbing of the bells
keeping time, time, time,
as he knells, knells, knells,
in a happy runic rhyme,
to the rolling of the bells
of the bells, bells, bells
to the tolling of the bells,
of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
bells, bells, bells
to the moaning and the groaning of the bells


ulalume
the skies they were ashen and sober
the leaves they were crisped and sere
the leaves they were withering and sere
it was night in the lonesome october
of my most immemorial year
it was hard by the dim lake of auber,
in the misty mid region of weir
it was down by the dank tarn of auber,
in the ghoulhaunted woodland of weir
here once, through an alley titanic
of cypress, i roamed with my soul
of cypress, with psyche, my soul
these were days when my heart was volcanic
as the scoriac rivers that roll
as the lavas that restlessly roll
their sulphurous currents down yaanek
in the ultimate climes of the pole
that groan as they roll down mount yaanek
in the realms of the boreal pole
our talk had been serious and sober,
but our thoughts they were palsied and sere
our memories were treacherous and sere
for we knew not the month was october,
and we marked not the night of the year
ah, night of all nights in the year
we noted not the dim lake of auber
though once we had journeyed down here
remembered not the dank tarn of auber,
nor the ghoulhaunted woodland of weir
and now as the night was senescent
and stardials pointed to morn
as the sundials hinted of morn
at the end of our path a liquescent
and nebulous lustre was born,
out of which a miraculous crescent
arose with a duplicate horn
astartes bediamonded crescent
distinct with its duplicate horn
and i saidshe is warmer than dian
she rolls through an ether of sighs
she revels in a region of sighs
she has seen that the tears are not dry on
these cheeks, where the worm never dies,
and has come past the stars of the lion
to point us the path to the skies
to the lethean peace of the skies
come up, in despite of the lion,
to shine on us with her bright eyes
come up through the lair of the lion,
with love in her luminous eyes
but psyche, uplifting her finger,
saidsadly this star i mistrust
her pallor i strangely mistrust
oh, hastenoh, let us not linger
oh, flylet us flyfor we must
in terror she spoke, letting sink her
wings till they trailed in the dust
in agony sobbed, letting sink her
plumes till they trailed in the dust
till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust
i repliedthis is nothing but dreaming
let us on by this tremulous light
let us bathe in this crystalline light
its sibyllic splendor is beaming
with hope and in beauty tonight
seeit flickers up the sky through the night
ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,
and be sure it will lead us aright
we safely may trust to a gleaming
that cannot but guide us aright,
since it flickers up to heaven through the night
thus i pacified psyche and kissed her,
and tempted her out of her gloom
and conquered her scruples and gloom
and we passed to the end of a vista,
but were stopped by the door of a tomb
by the door of a legended tomb
and i saidwhat is written, sweet sister,
on the door of this legended tomb?
she repliedulalumeulalume
tis the vault of thy lost ulalume
then my heart it grew ashen and sober
as the leaves that were crisped and sere
as the leaves that were withering and sere
and i criedit was surely october
on this very night of last year
that i journeyedi journeyed down here
that i brought a dread burden down here
on this night of all nights in the year,
ah, what demon has tempted me here?
well i know, now, this dim lake of auber
this misty mid region of weir
well i know, now, this dank tarn of auber,
this ghoulhaunted woodland of weir


to helen
i saw thee onceonce onlyyears ago
i must not say how manybut not many
it was a july midnight and from out
a fullorbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring,
sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,
there fell a silverysilken veil of light,
with quietude, and sultriness and slumber,
upon the upturnd faces of a thousand
roses that grew in an enchanted garden,
where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe
fell on the upturnd faces of these roses
that gave out, in return for the lovelight,
their odorous souls in an ecstatic death
fell on the upturnd faces of these roses
that smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted
by thee, and by the poetry of thy presence
clad all in white, upon a violet bank
i saw thee halfreclining while the moon
fell on the upturnd faces of the roses,
and on thine own, upturndalas, in sorrow
was it not fate, that, on this july midnight
was it not fate whose name is also sorrow,
that bade me pause before that gardengate,
to breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?
no footstep stirred the hated world all slept,
save only thee and meo heaveno god
how my heart beats in coupling those two words
save only thee and me i pausedi looked
and in an instant all things disappeared
ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted
the pearly lustre of the moon went out
the mossy banks and the meandering paths,
the happy flowers and the repining trees,
were seen no more the very roses odors
died in the arms of the adoring airs
allall expired save theesave less than thou
save only the divine light in thine eyes
save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes
i saw but themthey were the world to me
i saw but themsaw only them for hours
saw only them until the moon went down
what wild hearthistories seemed to lie unwritten
upon those crystalline, celestial spheres
how dark a woe yet how sublime a hope
how silently serene a sea of pride
how daring an ambition yet how deep
how fathomless a capacity for love
but now, at length, dear dian sank from sight,
into a western couch of thundercloud
and thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees
didst glide away only thine eyes remained
they would not gothey never yet have gone
lighting my lonely pathway home that night,
they have not left me as my hopes have since
they follow methey lead me through the years
they are my ministersyet i their slave
their office is to illumine and enkindle
my duty, to be saved by their bright light,
and purified in their electric fire,
and sanctified in their elysian fire
they fill my soul with beauty which is hope,
and are far up in heaventhe stars i kneel to
in the sad, silent watches of my night
while even in the meridian glare of day
i see them stilltwo sweetly scintillant
venuses, unextinguished by the sun


annabel lee
it was many and many a year ago,
in a kingdom by the sea,
that a maiden there lived whom you may know
by the name of annabel lee
and this maiden she lived with no other thought
than to love and be loved by me
i was a child and she was a child,
in this kingdom by the sea
but we loved with a love that was more than love
i and my annabel lee
with a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
coveted her and me
and this was the reason that, long ago,
in this kingdom by the sea,
a wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
my beautiful annabel lee
so that her highborn kinsmen came
and bore her away from me,
to shut her up in a sepulchre
in this kingdom by the sea
the angels, not half so happy in heaven,
went envying her and me
yesthat was the reason as all men know,
in this kingdom by the sea
that the wind came out of the cloud by night,
chilling and killing my annabel lee
but our love it was stronger by far than the love
of those who were older than we
of many far wiser than we
and neither the angels in heaven above,
nor the demons down under the sea,
can ever dissever my soul from the soul
of the beautiful annabel lee
for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
of the beautiful annabel lee
and the stars never rise but i see the bright eyes
of the beautiful annabel lee
and so, all the nighttide, i lie down by the side
of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride,
in her sepulchre there by the sea
in her tomb by the side of the sea

and yet there is in this no gordian knot

seldom we find, says solomon don dunce,
half an idea in the profoundest sonnet

to my mother
because i feel that, in the heavens above,
the angels, whispering to one another,
can find, among their burning terms of love,
none so devotional as that of mother,
therefore by that dear name i long have called you
you who are more than mother unto me,
and fill my heart of hearts, where death installed you,
in setting my virginias spirit free
my mothermy own mother, who died early,
was but the mother of myself but you
are mother to the one i loved so dearly,
and thus are dearer than the mother i knew
by that infinity with which my wife
was dearer to my soul than its soullife

the above was addressed to the poets motherinlaw, mrs clemmed

for annie
thank heaven the crisis
the danger is past,
and the lingering illness
is over at last
and the fever called living
is conquered at last
sadly, i know,
i am shorn of my strength,
and no muscle i move
as i lie at full length
but no matteri feel
i am better at length
and i rest so composedly,
now in my bed,
that any beholder
might fancy me dead
might start at beholding me
thinking me dead
the moaning and groaning,
the sighing and sobbing,
are quieted now,
with that horrible throbbing
at heartah, that horrible,
horrible throbbing
the sicknessthe nausea
the pitiless pain
have ceased, with the fever
that maddened my brain
with the fever called living
that burned in my brain
and oh of all tortures
that torture the worst
has abatedthe terrible
torture of thirst,
for the naphthaline river
of passion accurst
i have drank of a water
that quenches all thirst
of a water that flows,
with a lullaby sound,
from a spring but a very few
feet under ground
from a cavern not very far
down under ground
and ah let it never
be foolishly said
that my room it is gloomy
and narrow my bed
for man never slept
in a different bed
and, to sleep, you must slumber
in just such a bed
my tantalized spirit
here blandly reposes,
forgetting, or never
regretting its roses
its old agitations
of myrtles and roses
for now, while so quietly
lying, it fancies
a holier odor
about it, of pansies
a rosemary odor,
commingled with pansies
with rue and the beautiful
puritan pansies
and so it lies happily,
bathing in many
a dream of the truth
and the beauty of annie
drowned in a bath
of the tresses of annie
she tenderly kissed me,
she fondly caressed,
and then i fell gently
to sleep on her breast
deeply to sleep
from the heaven of her breast
when the light was extinguished,
she covered me warm,
and she prayed to the angels
to keep me from harm
to the queen of the angels
to shield me from harm
and i lie so composedly,
now in my bed
knowing her love
that you fancy me dead
and i rest so contentedly,
now in my bed,
with her love at my breast
that you fancy me dead
that you shudder to look at me
thinking me dead
but my heart it is brighter
than all of the many
stars in the sky,
for it sparkles with annie
it glows with the light
of the love of my annie
with the thought of the light
of the eyes of my annie


to f
beloved amid the earnest woes
that crowd around my earthly path
drear path, alas where grows
not even one lonely rose
my soul at least a solace hath
in dreams of thee, and therein knows
an eden of bland repose
and thus thy memory is to me
like some enchanted faroff isle
in some tumultuous sea
some ocean throbbing far and free
with stormbut where meanwhile
serenest skies continually
just oer that one bright inland smile


to frances s osgood
thou wouldst be loved?then let thy heart
from its present pathway part not
being everything which now thou art,
be nothing which thou art not
so with the world thy gentle ways,
thy grace, thy more than beauty,
shall be an endless theme of praise
and love a simple duty


eldorado
gaily bedight,
a gallant knight,
in sunshine and in shadow,
had journeyed long,
singing a song,
in search of eldorado
but he grew old
this knight so bold
and oer his heart a shadow
fell as he found
no spot of ground
that looked like eldorado
and, as his strength
failed him at length,
he met a pilgrim shadow
shadow, said he,
where can it be
this land of eldorado?
over the mountains
of the moon,
down the valley of the shadow,
ride, boldly ride,
the shade replied,
if you seek for eldorado


eulalie
i dwelt alone
in a world of moan,
and my soul was a stagnant tide,
till the fair and gentle eulalie became my blushing bride
till the yellowhaired young eulalie became my smiling bride
ah, lessless bright
the stars of the night
than the eyes of the radiant girl
and never a flake
that the vapor can make
with the moontints of purple and pearl,
can vie with the modest eulalies most unregarded curl
can compare with the brighteyed eulalies most humble and careless
curl
now doubtnow pain
come never again,
for her soul gives me sigh for sigh,
and all day long
shines, bright and strong,
astart within the sky,
while ever to her dear eulalie upturns her matron eye
while ever to her young eulalie upturns her violet eye


a dream within a dream
take this kiss upon the brow
and, in parting from you now,
thus much let me avow
you are not wrong, who deem
that my days have been a dream
yet if hope has flown away
in a night, or in a day,
in a vision or in none,
is it therefore the less gone?
all that we see or seem
is but a dream within a dream
i stand amid the roar
of a surftormented shore,
and i hold within my hand
grains of the golden sand
how few yet how they creep
through my fingers to the deep
while i weepwhile i weep
o god can i not grasp
them with a tighter clasp?
o god can i not save
one from the pitiless wave?
is all that we see or seem
but a dream within a dream?


to marie louise shew
of all who hail thy presence as the morning
of all to whom thine absence is the night
the blotting utterly from out high heaven
the sacred sunof all who, weeping, bless thee
hourly for hopefor lifeah, above all,
for the resurrection of deep buried faith
in truth, in virtue, in humanity
of all who, on despairs unhallowed bed
lying down to die, have suddenly arisen
at thy softmurmured words, let there be light
at thy softmurmured words that were fulfilled
in thy seraphic glancing of thine eyes
of all who owe thee most, whose gratitude
nearest resembles worship,oh, remember
the truest, the most fervently devoted,
and think that these weak lines are written by him
by him who, as he pens them, thrills to think
his spirit is communing with an angels


to marie louise shew
not long ago, the writer of these lines,
in the mad pride of intellectuality,
maintained the power of wordsdenied that ever
a thought arose within the human brain
beyond the utterance of the human tongue
and now, as if in mockery of that boast,
two wordstwo foreign soft dissyllables
italian tones, made only to be murmured
by angels dreaming in the moonlit dew
that hangs like chains of pearl on hermon hill,
have stirred from out the abysses of his heart,
unthoughtlike thoughts that are the souls of thought,
richer, far wilder, far diviner visions
than even the seraph harper, israfel,
who has the sweetest voice of all gods creatures,
could hope to utter and i my spells are broken
the pen falls powerless from my shivering hand
with thy dear name as text, though hidden by thee,
i cannot writei cannot speak or think
alas, i cannot feel for tis not feeling,
this standing motionless upon the golden
threshold of the wideopen gate of dreams,
gazing, entranced, adown the gorgeous vista,
and thrilling as i see, upon the right,
upon the left, and all the way along,
amid empurpled vapors, far away
to where the prospect terminatesthee only

the city in the sea
lo death has reared himself a throne
in a strange city lying alone
far down within the dim west,
where the good and the bad and the worst and the best
have gone to their eternal rest
there shrines and palaces and towers
timeeaten towers and tremble not
resemble nothing that is ours
around, by lifting winds forgot,
resignedly beneath the sky
the melancholy waters lie
no rays from the holy heaven come down
on the long nighttime of that town
but light from out the lurid sea
streams up the turrets silently
gleams up the pinnacles far and free
up domesup spiresup kingly halls
up fanesup babylonlike walls
up shadowy longforgotten bowers
of sculptured ivy and stone flowers
up many and many a marvellous shrine
whose wreathed friezes intertwine
the viol, the violet, and the vine
resignedly beneath the sky
the melancholy waters lie
so blend the turrets and shadows there
that all seem pendulous in air,
while from a proud tower in the town
death looks gigantically down
there open fanes and gaping graves
yawn level with the luminous waves
but not the riches there that lie
in each idols diamond eye
not the gailyjewelled dead
tempt the waters from their bed
for no ripples curl, alas
along that wilderness of glass
no swellings tell that winds may be
upon some faroff happier sea
no heavings hint that winds have been
on seas less hideously serene
but lo, a stir is in the air
the wavethere is a movement there
as if the towers had thrust aside,
in slightly sinking, the dull tide
as if their tops had feebly given
a void within the filmy heaven
the waves have now a redder glow
the hours are breathing faint and low
and when, amid no earthly moans,
down, down that town shall settle hence,
hell, rising from a thousand thrones,
shall do it reverence
?

the sleeper
at midnight, in the month of june,
i stand beneath the mystic moon
an opiate vapor, dewy, dim,
exhales from out her golden rim,
and, softly dripping, drop by drop,
upon the quiet mountain top,
steals drowsily and musically
into the universal valley
the rosemary nods upon the grave
the lily lolls upon the wave
wrapping the fog about its breast,
the ruin moulders into rest
looking like lethe, see the lake
a conscious slumber seems to take,
and would not, for the world, awake
all beauty sleepsand lo where lies
her casement open to the skies
irene, with her destinies
oh, lady bright can it be right
this window open to the night
the wanton airs, from the treetop,
laughingly through the latticedrop
the bodiless airs, a wizard rout,
flit through thy chamber in and out,
and wave the curtain canopy
so fitfullyso fearfully
above the closed and fringed lid
neath which thy slumbring soul lies hid,
that, oer the floor and down the wall,
like ghosts the shadows rise and fall
oh, lady dear, hast thou no fear?
why and what art thou dreaming here?
sure thou art come oer faroff seas,
a wonder to these garden trees
strange is thy pallor strange thy dress
strange, above all, thy length of tress,
and this allsolemn silentness
the lady sleeps oh, may her sleep
which is enduring, so be deep
heaven have her in its sacred keep
this chamber changed for one more holy,
this bed for one more melancholy,
i pray to god that she may lie
for ever with unopened eye,
while the dim sheeted ghosts go by
my love, she sleeps oh, may her sleep,
as it is lasting, so be deep
soft may the worms about her creep
far in the forest, dim and old,
for her may some tall vault unfold
some vault that oft hath flung its black
and winged panels fluttering back,
triumphant, oer the crested palls,
of her grand family funerals
some sepulchre, remote, alone,
against whose portal she hath thrown,
in childhood many an idle stone
some tomb from out whose sounding door
she neer shall force an echo more,
thrilling to think, poor child of sin
it was the dead who groaned within


bridal ballad
the ring is on my hand,
and the wreath is on my brow
satins and jewels grand
are all at my command
and i am happy now
and my lord he loves me well
but, when first he breathed his vow,
i felt my bosom swell
for the words rang as a knell,
and the voice seemed his who fell
in the battle down the dell,
and who is happy now
but he spoke to reassure me,
and he kissed my pallid brow,
while a reverie came oer me,
and to the churchyard bore me,
and i sighed to him before me,
thinking him dead delormie,
oh, i am happy now
and thus the words were spoken,
and thus the plighted vow,
and, though my faith be broken,
and, though my heart be broken,
behold the golden keys
that proves me happy now
would to god i could awaken
for i dream i know not how,
and my soul is sorely shaken
lest an evil step be taken,
lest the dead who is forsaken
may not be happy now


notes
the raven
the raven was first published on the th january, , in the new
york evening mirrora paper its author was then assistant editor of
it was prefaced by the following words, understood to have been written
by n p willis
we are permitted to copy in advance of publication from the second
number of the american review, the following remarkable poem by
edgar poe in our opinion, it is the most effective single example of
fugitive poetry ever published in this country, and unsurpassed in
english poetry for subtle conception, masterly ingenuity of
versification, and consistent sustaining of imaginative lift and
pokerishness it is one of those dainties bred in a book which we
feed on it will stick to the memory of everybody who reads it
in the february number of the american review the poem was published
as by quarles, and it was introduced by the following note, evidently
suggested if not written by poe himself
the following lines from a correspondentbesides the deep, quaint
strain of the sentiment, and the curious introduction of some
ludicrous touches amidst the serious and impressive, as was doubtless
intended by the authorappears to us one of the most felicitous
specimens of unique rhyming which has for some time met our eye the
resources of english rhythm for varieties of melody, measure, and
sound, producing corresponding diversities of effect, have been
thoroughly studied, much more perceived, by very few poets in the
language while the classic tongues, especially the greek, possess, by
power of accent, several advantages for versification over our own,
chiefly through greater abundance of spondaic feet, we have other and
very great advantages of sound by the modern usage of rhyme
alliteration is nearly the only effect of that kind which the ancients
had in common with us it will be seen that much of the melody of the
raven arises from alliteration and the studious use of similar sounds
in unusual places in regard to its measure, it may be noted that if
all the verses were like the second, they might properly be placed
merely in short lines, producing a not uncommon form but the presence
in all the others of one linemostly the second in the verse
stanza?which flows continuously, with only an aspirate pause in
the middle, like that before the short line in the sapphio adonic,
while the fifth has at the middle pause no similarity of sound with
any part beside, gives the versification an entirely different effect
we could wish the capacities of our noble language in prosody were
better understood

the bells
the bibliographical history of the bells is curious the subject, and
some lines of the original version, having been suggested by the poets
friend, mrs shew, poe, when he wrote out the first draft of the poem,
headed it, the bells by mrs m a shew this draft, now the editors
property, consists of only seventeen lines, and reads thus
i
the bellsah the bells
the little silver bells
how fairylike a melody there floats
from their throats
from their merry little throats
from the silver, tinkling throats
of the bells, bells, bells
of the bells
ii
the bellsah, the bells
the heavy iron bells
how horrible a monody there floats
from their throats
from their deeptoned throats
from their melancholy throats

poems of manhood

lenore
ah, broken is the golden bowl the spirit flown forever
let the bell tolla saintly soul floats on the stygian river
and, guy de vere, hast thou no tear?weep now or never more
see on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, lenore
come let the burial rite be readthe funeral song be sung
an anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young
a dirge for her, the doubly dead in that she died so young
wretches ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride,
and when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed herthat she died
how shall the ritual, then, be read?the requiem how be sung
by youby yours, the evil eye,by yours, the slanderous tongue
that did to death the innocence that died, and died so young?
peccavimus but rave not thus and let a sabbath song
go up to god so solemnly the dead may feel no wrong
the sweet lenore hath gone before, with hope, that flew beside,
leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy bride
for her, the fair and dbonnaire, that now so lowly lies,
the life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes
the life still there, upon her hairthe death upon her eyes
avaunt tonight my heart is light no dirge will i upraise,
but waft the angel on her flight with a pan of old days
let no bell tolllest her sweet soul, amid its hallowed mirth,
should catch the note, as it doth float up from the damned earth
to friends above, from fiends below, the indignant ghost is riven
from hell unto a high estate far up within the heaven
from grief and groan to a golden throne beside the king of heaven


to one in paradise,
thou wast that all to me, love,
for which my soul did pine
a green isle in the sea, love,
a fountain and a shrine,
all wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers,
and all the flowers were mine
ah, dream too bright to last
ah, starry hope that didst arise
but to be overcast
a voice from out the future cries,
on onbut oer the past
dim gulf my spirit hovering lies
mute, motionless, aghast
for, alas alas with me
the light of life is oer
no moreno moreno more
such language holds the solemn sea
to the sands upon the shore
shall bloom the thunderblasted tree,
or the stricken eagle soar
and all my days are trances,
and all my nightly dreams
are where thy dark eye glances,
and where thy footstep gleams
in what ethereal dances,
by what eternal streams
alas for that accursed time
they bore thee oer the billow,
from love to titled age and crime,
and an unholy pillow
from me, and from our misty clime,
where weeps the silver willow


the coliseum
type of the antique rome rich reliquary
of lofty contemplation left to time
by buried centuries of pomp and power
at lengthat lengthafter so many days
of weary pilgrimage and burning thirst,
thirst for the springs of lore that in thee lie,
i kneel, an altered and an humble man,
amid thy shadows, and so drink within
my very soul thy grandeur, gloom, and glory
vastness and age and memories of eld
silence and desolation and dim night
i feel ye nowi feel ye in your strength
o spells more sure than eer judan king
taught in the gardens of gethsemane
o charms more potent than the rapt chaldee
ever drew down from out the quiet stars
here, where a hero fell, a column falls
here, where the mimic eagle glared in gold,
a midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat
here, where the dames of rome their gilded hair
waved to the wind, now wave the reed and thistle
here, where on golden throne the monarch lolled,
glides, spectrelike, unto his marble home,
lit by the wan light of the horned moon,
the swift and silent lizard of the stones
but stay these wallsthese ivyclad arcades
these mouldering plinthsthese sad and blackened shafts
these vague entablaturesthis crumbling frieze
these shattered cornicesthis wreckthis ruin
these stonesalas these gray stonesare they all
all of the famed, and the colossal left
by the corrosive hours to fate and me?
not allthe echoes answer menot all
prophetic sounds and loud, arise forever
from us, and from all ruin, unto the wise,
as melody from memnon to the sun
we rule the hearts of mightiest menwe rule
with a despotic sway all giant minds
we are not impotentwe pallid stones
not all our power is gonenot all our fame
not all the magic of our high renown
not all the wonder that encircles us
not all the mysteries that in us lie
not all the memories that hang upon
and cling around about us as a garment,
clothing us in a robe of more than glory


the haunted palace
in the greenest of our valleys
by good angels tenanted,
once a fair and stately palace
radiant palacereared its head
in the monarch thoughts dominion
it stood there
never seraph spread a pinion
over fabric half so fair
banners yellow, glorious, golden,
on its roof did float and flow,
thisall thiswas in the olden
time long ago,
and every gentle air that dallied,
in that sweet day,
along the ramparts plumed and pallid,
a winged odor went away
wanderers in that happy valley,
through two luminous windows, saw
spirits moving musically,
to a lutes welltund law,
bound about a throne where, sitting
porphyrogene
in state his glory well befitting,
the ruler of the realm was seen
and all with pearl and ruby glowing
was the fair palace door,
through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,
and sparkling evermore,
a troop of echoes, whose sweet duty
was but to sing,
in voices of surpassing beauty,
the wit and wisdom of their king
but evil things, in robes of sorrow,
assailed the monarchs high estate
ah, let us mournfor never morrow
shall dawn upon him desolate
and round about his home the glory
that blushed and bloomed,
is but a dimremembered story
of the old time entombed
and travellers, now, within that valley,
through the redlitten windows see
vast forms, that move fantastically
to a discordant melody,
while, like a ghastly rapid river,
through the pale door
a hideous throng rush out forever
and laughbut smile no more


the conqueror worm
lo tis a gala night
within the lonesome latter years
an angel throng, bewinged, bedight
in veils, and drowned in tears,
sit in a theatre, to see
a play of hopes and fears,
while the orchestra breathes fitfully
the music of the spheres
mimes, in the form of god on high,
mutter and mumble low,
and hither and thither fly
mere puppets they, who come and go
at bidding of vast formless things
that shift the scenery to and fro,
flapping from out their condor wings
invisible wo
that motley dramaoh, be sure
it shall not be forgot
with its phantom chased for evermore,
by a crowd that seize it not,
through a circle that ever returneth in
to the selfsame spot,
and much of madness, and more of sin,
and horror the soul of the plot
but see, amid the mimic rout
a crawling shape intrude
a bloodred thing that writhes from out
the scenic solitude
it writhesit writheswith mortal pangs
the mimes become its food,
and the angels sob at vermin fangs
in human gore imbued
outout are the lightsout all
and, over each quivering form,
the curtain, a funeral pall,
comes down with the rush of a storm,
and the angels, all pallid and wan,
uprising, unveiling, affirm
that the play is the tragedy, man,
and its hero the conqueror worm


silence
there are some qualitiessome incorporate things,
that have a double life, which thus is made
a type of that twin entity which springs
from matter and light, evinced in solid and shade
there is a twofold silencesea and shore
body and soul one dwells in lonely places,
newly with grass oergrown some solemn graces,
some human memories and tearful lore,
render him terrorless his names no more
he is the corporate silence dread him not
no power hath he of evil in himself
but should some urgent fate untimely lot
bring thee to meet his shadow nameless elf,
that haunteth the lone regions where hath trod
no foot of man, commend thyself to god


dreamland
by a route obscure and lonely,
haunted by ill angels only,
where an eidolon, named night,
on a black throne reigns upright,
i have reached these lands but newly
from an ultimate dim thule
from a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime,
out of spaceout of time
bottomless vales and boundless floods,
and chasms, and caves, and titan woods,
with forms that no man can discover
for the dews that drip all over
mountains toppling evermore
into seas without a shore
seas that restlessly aspire,
surging, unto skies of fire
lakes that endlessly outspread
their lone waterslone and dead,
their still watersstill and chilly
with the snows of the lolling lily
by the lakes that thus outspread
their lone waters, lone and dead,
their sad waters, sad and chilly
with the snows of the lolling lily,
by the mountainsnear the river
murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,
by the gray woods,by the swamp
where the toad and the newt encamp,
by the dismal tarns and pools
where dwell the ghouls,
by each spot the most unholy
in each nook most melancholy,
there the traveller meets aghast
sheeted memories of the past
shrouded forms that start and sigh
as they pass the wanderer by
whiterobed forms of friends long given,
in agony, to the earthand heaven
for the heart whose woes are legion
tis a peaceful, soothing region
for the spirit that walks in shadow
tisoh, tis an eldorado
but the traveller, travelling through it,
may notdare not openly view it
never its mysteries are exposed
to the weak human eye unclosed
so wills its king, who hath forbid
the uplifting of the fringed lid
and thus the sad soul that here passes
beholds it but through darkened glasses
by a route obscure and lonely,
haunted by ill angels only
where an eidolon, named night,
on a black throne reigns upright,
i have wandered home but newly
from this ultimate dim thule


to zante
fair isle, that from the fairest of all flowers,
thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take
how many memories of what radiant hours
at sight of thee and thine at once awake
how many scenes of what departed bliss
how many thoughts of what entombed hopes
how many visions of a maiden that is
no moreno more upon thy verdant slopes
no more alas, that magical sad sound
transforming all thy charms shall please no more
thy memory no more accursed ground
henceforward i hold thy flowerenamelled shore,
o hyacinthine isle o purple zante
isola doro fior di levante


hymn
at mornat noonat twilight dim
maria thou hast heard my hymn
in joy and woin good and ill
mother of god, be with me still
when the hours flew brightly by,
and not a cloud obscured the sky,
my soul, lest it should truant be,
thy grace did guide to thine and thee
now, when storms of fate oercast
darkly my present and my past,
let my future radiant shine
with sweet hopes of thee and thine

note on politian
such portions of politian as are known to the public first saw the
light of publicity in the southern literary messenger for december
and january , being styled scenes from politian an
unpublished drama these scenes were included, unaltered, in the
collection of poems by poe the larger portion of the original draft
subsequently became the property of the present editor, but it is not
considered just to the poets memory to publish it the work is a hasty
and unrevised production of its authors earlier days of literary labor
and, beyond the scenes already known, scarcely calculated to enhance his
reputation as a specimen, however, of the parts unpublished, the
following fragment from the first scene of act ii may be offered the
duke, it should be premised, is uncle to alessandra, and father of
castiglione her betrothed
duke           why do you laugh?
castiglione    indeed
i hardly know myself stay was it not
on yesterday we were speaking of the earl?
of the earl politian? yes it was yesterday
alessandra, you and i, you must remember
we were walking in the garden
duke           perfectly
i do remember itwhat of itwhat then?
cas            o nothingnothing at all
duke           nothing at all
it is most singular that you should laugh
at nothing at all
cas            most singularsingular
duke           look yon, castiglione, be so kind
as tell me, sir, at once what tis you mean
what are you talking of?
cas            was it not so?
we differed in opinion touching him
duke           himwhom?
cas            why, sir, the earl politian
duke           the earl of leicester yesis it he you mean?
we differed, indeed if i now recollect
the words you used were that the earl you knew
was neither learned nor mirthful
cas            ha hanow did i?
duke           that did you, sir, and well i knew at the time
you were wrong, it being not the character
of the earlwhom all the world allows to be
a most hilarious man be not, my son,
too positive again
cas            tis singular
most singular i could not think it possible
so little time could so much alter one
to say the truth about an hour ago,
as i was walking with the count san ozzo,
all arm in arm, we met this very man
the earlhe, with his friend baldazzar,
having just arrived in rome ha ha he is altered
such an account he gave me of his journey
twould have made you die with laughtersuch tales he
told
of his caprices and his merry freaks
along the roadsuch odditysuch humor
such witsuch whimsuch flashes of wild merriment
set off too in such full relief by the grave
demeanor of his friendwho, to speak the truth
was gravity itself
duke           did i not tell you?
cas            you didand yet tis strange but true, as strange,
how much i was mistaken i always thought
the earl a gloomy man
duke           so, so, you see
be not too positive whom have we here?
it cannot be the earl?
cas            the earl oh no
tis not the earlbut yet it isand leaning
upon his friend baldazzar ah welcome, sir
enter politian and baldazzar
my lord, a second welcome let me give you
to romehis grace the duke of broglio
father this is the earl politian, earl
of leicester in great britain
politian bows haughtily
that, his friend
baldazzar, duke of surrey the earl has letters,
so please you, for your grace
duke           ha ha most welcome
to rome and to our palace, earl politian
and you, most noble duke i am glad to see you
i knew your father well, my lord politian
castiglione call your cousin hither,
and let me make the noble earl acquainted
with your betrothed you come, sir, at a time
most seasonable the wedding
politian       touching those letters, sir,
your son made mention ofyour son, is he not?
touching those letters, sir, i wot not of them
if such there be, my friend baldazzar here
baldazzar ahmy friend baldazzar here
will hand them to your grace i would retire
duke           retireso soon?
cas            what ho benito rupert
his lordships chambersshow his lordship to them
his lordship is unwell
enter benito
ben            this way, my lord
exit, followed by politian
duke           retire unwell
bal            so please you, sir i fear me
tis as you sayhis lordship is unwell
the damp air of the eveningthe fatigue
of a long journeytheindeed i had better
follow his lordship he must be unwell
i will return anon
duke           return anon
now this is very strange castiglione
this way, my son, i wish to speak with thee
you surely were mistaken in what you said
of the earl, mirthful, indeedwhich of us said
politian was a melancholy man?

poems of youth

introduction to poems
letter to mr b
west point,
dear b

believing only a portion of my former volume to be worthy a second
editionthat small portion i thought it as well to include in the
present book as to republish by itself i have therefore herein combined
al aaraaf and tamerlane with other poems hitherto unprinted nor
have i hesitated to insert from the minor poems, now omitted, whole
lines, and even passages, to the end that being placed in a fairer
light, and the trash shaken from them in which they were imbedded, they
may have some chance of being seen by posterity
it has been said that a good critique on a poem may be written by one
who is no poet himself this, according to your idea and mine of
poetry, i feel to be falsethe less poetical the critic, the less just
the critique, and the converse on this account, and because there are
but few bs in the world, i would be as much ashamed of the worlds
good opinion as proud of your own another than yourself might here
observe, shakespeare is in possession of the worlds good opinion, and
yet shakespeare is the greatest of poets it appears then that the world
judge correctly, why should you be ashamed of their favorable judgment?
the difficulty lies in the interpretation of the word judgment or
opinion the opinion is the worlds, truly, but it may be called
theirs as a man would call a book his, having bought it he did not
write the book, but it is his they did not originate the opinion, but
it is theirs a fool, for example, thinks shakespeare a great poetyet
the fool has never read shakespeare but the fools neighbor, who is a
step higher on the andes of the mind, whose head that is to say, his
more exalted thought is too far above the fool to be seen or
understood, but whose feet by which i mean his everyday actions are
sufficiently near to be discerned, and by means of which that
superiority is ascertained, which but for them would never have been
discoveredthis neighbor asserts that shakespeare is a great poetthe
fool believes him, and it is henceforward his opinion this neighbors
own opinion has, in like manner, been adopted from one above him, and
so, ascendingly, to a few gifted individuals who kneel around the
summit, beholding, face to face, the master spirit who stands upon the
pinnacle
you are aware of the great barrier in the path of an american writer
he is read, if at all, in preference to the combined and established wit
of the world i say established for it is with literature as with law
or empirean established name is an estate in tenure, or a throne in
possession besides, one might suppose that books, like their authors,
improve by traveltheir having crossed the sea is, with us, so great a
distinction our antiquaries abandon time for distance our very fops
glance from the binding to the bottom of the titlepage, where the
mystic characters which spell london, paris, or genoa, are precisely so
many letters of recommendation
i mentioned just now a vulgar error as regards criticism i think the
notion that no poet can form a correct estimate of his own writings is
another i remarked before that in proportion to the poetical talent
would be the justice of a critique upon poetry therefore a bad poet
would, i grant, make a false critique, and his selflove would
infallibly bias his little judgment in his favor but a poet, who is
indeed a poet, could not, i think, fail of making a just critique
whatever should be deducted on the score of selflove might be replaced
on account of his intimate acquaintance with the subject in short, we
have more instances of false criticism than of just where ones own
writings are the test, simply because we have more bad poets than good
there are, of course, many objections to what i say milton is a great
example of the contrary but his opinion with respect to the paradise
regained is by no means fairly ascertained by what trivial
circumstances men are often led to assert what they do not really
believe perhaps an inadvertent word has descended to posterity but, in
fact, the paradise regained is little, if at all, inferior to the
paradise lost, and is only supposed so to be because men do not like
epics, whatever they may say to the contrary, and reading those of
milton in their natural order, are too much wearied with the first to
derive any pleasure from the second
i dare say milton preferred comus to eitherif sojustly
as i am speaking of poetry, it will not be amiss to touch slightly upon
the most singular heresy in its modern historythe heresy of what is
called, very foolishly, the lake school some years ago i might have
been induced, by an occasion like the present, to attempt a formal
refutation of their doctrine at present it would be a work of
supererogation the wise must bow to the wisdom of such men as coleridge
and southey, but being wise, have laughed at poetical theories so
prosaically exemplified
aristotle, with singular assurance, has declared poetry the most
philosophical of all writingsbut it required a wordsworth to pronounce
it the most metaphysical he seems to think that the end of poetry is,
or should be, instruction yet it is a truism that the end of our
existence is happiness if so, the end of every separate part of our
existence, everything connected with our existence, should be still
happiness therefore the end of instruction should be happiness and
happiness is another name for pleasuretherefore the end of
instruction should be pleasure yet we see the abovementioned opinion
implies precisely the reverse
to proceed ceteris paribus, he who pleases is of more importance to
his fellowmen than he who instructs, since utility is happiness, and
pleasure is the end already obtained which instruction is merely the
means of obtaining
i see no reason, then, why our metaphysical poets should plume
themselves so much on the utility of their works, unless indeed they
refer to instruction with eternity in view in which case, sincere
respect for their piety would not allow me to express my contempt for
their judgment contempt which it would be difficult to conceal, since
their writings are professedly to be understood by the few, and it is
the many who stand in need of salvation in such case i should no doubt
be tempted to think of the devil in melmoth, who labors indefatigably,
through three octavo volumes, to accomplish the destruction of one or
two souls, while any common devil would have demolished one or two
thousand
against the subtleties which would make poetry a studynot a
passionit becomes the metaphysician to reasonbut the poet to
protest yet wordsworth and coleridge are men in years the one imbued
in contemplation from his childhood the other a giant in intellect and
learning the diffidence, then, with which i venture to dispute their
authority would be overwhelming did i not feel, from the bottom of my
heart, that learning has little to do with the imaginationintellect
with the passionsor age with poetry
trifles, like straws, upon the surface flow
he who would search for pearls must dive below,
are lines which have done much mischief as regards the greater truths,
men oftener err by seeking them at the bottom than at the top truth
lies in the huge abysses where wisdom is soughtnot in the palpable
palaces where she is found the ancients were not always right in hiding
the goddess in a well witness the light which bacon has thrown upon
philosophy witness the principles of our divine faiththat moral
mechanism by which the simplicity of a child may overbalance the wisdom
of a man
we see an instance of coleridges liability to err, in his biographia
literariaprofessedly his literary life and opinions, but, in fact, a
treatise de omni scibili et quibusdam aliis he goes wrong by reason
of his very profundity, and of his error we have a natural type in the
contemplation of a star he who regards it directly and intensely sees,
it is true, the star, but it is the star without a raywhile he who
surveys it less inquisitively is conscious of all for which the star is
useful to us belowits brilliancy and its beauty
as to wordsworth, i have no faith in him that he had in youth the
feelings of a poet i believefor there are glimpses of extreme delicacy
in his writingsand delicacy is the poets own kingdomhis el
doradobut they have the appearance of a better day recollected and
glimpses, at best, are little evidence of present poetic fire we know
that a few straggling flowers spring up daily in the crevices of the
glacier
he was to blame in wearing away his youth in contemplation with the end
of poetizing in his manhood with the increase of his judgment the light
which should make it apparent has faded away his judgment consequently
is too correct this may not be understood,but the old goths of
germany would have understood it, who used to debate matters of
importance to their state twice, once when drunk, and once when
sobersober that they might not be deficient in formalitydrunk lest
they should be destitute of vigor
the long wordy discussions by which he tries to reason us into
admiration of his poetry, speak very little in his favor they are full
of such assertions as this i have opened one of his volumes at
randomof genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is
worthy to be done, and what was never done beforeindeed? then it
follows that in doing what is unworthy to be done, or what has been
done before, no genius can be evinced yet the picking of pockets is an
unworthy act, pockets have been picked time immemorial, and barrington,
the pickpocket, in point of genius, would have thought hard of a
comparison with william wordsworth, the poet
again, in estimating the merit of certain poems, whether they be
ossians or macphersons can surely be of little consequence, yet, in
order to prove their worthlessness, mr w has expended many pages in
the controversy tantne animis? can great minds descend to such
absurdity? but worse still that he may bear down every argument in
favor of these poems, he triumphantly drags forward a passage, in his
abomination with which he expects the reader to sympathise it is the
beginning of the epic poem temora the blue waves of ullin roll in
light the green hills are covered with day trees shake their dusty
heads in the breeze and thisthis gorgeous, yet simple imagery, where
all is alive and panting with immortalitythis, william wordsworth, the
author of peter bell, has selected for his contempt we shall see
what better he, in his own person, has to offer imprimis

no other sheep was near, the lamb was all alone,

indeed we will, mr, w is it sympathy for the sheep you wish to excite?
i love a sheep from the bottom of my heart
but there are occasions, dear b, there are occasions when even
wordsworth is reasonable even stamboul, it is said, shall have an end,
and the most unlucky blunders must come to a conclusion here is an
extract from his preface
those who have been accustomed to the phraseology of modern writers,
if they persist in reading this book to a conclusion impossible
will, no doubt, have to struggle with feelings of awkwardness ha
ha ha they will look round for poetry ha ha ha ha, and will
be induced to inquire by what species of courtesy these attempts have
been permitted to assume that title ha ha ha ha ha
yet, let not mr w despair he has given immortality to a wagon, and
the bee sophocles has transmitted to eternity a sore toe, and dignified
a tragedy with a chorus of turkeys

intellect his gigantic power to use an author quoted by himself,

and to employ his own language, he has imprisoned his own conceptions by
the barrier he has erected against those of others it is lamentable to
think that such a mind should be buried in metaphysics, and, like the
nyctanthes, waste its perfume upon the night alone in reading that
mans poetry, i tremble like one who stands upon a volcano, conscious
from the very darkness bursting from the crater, of the fire and the
light that are weltering below
what is poetry?poetry that proteuslike idea, with as many
appellations as the ninetitled corcyra give me, i demanded of a
scholar some time ago, give me a definition of poetry
tresvolontiers and he proceeded to his library, brought me a dr
johnson, and overwhelmed me with a definition shade of the immortal
shakespeare i imagine to myself the scowl of your spiritual eye upon
the profanity of that scurrilous ursa major think of poetry, dear
b, think of poetry, and then think of dr samuel johnson think of
all that is airy and fairylike, and then of all that is hideous and
unwieldy think of his huge bulk, the elephant and thenand then think

a poem, in my opinion, is opposed to a work of science by having, for
its immediate object, pleasure, not truth to romance, by having, for
its object, an indefinite instead of a definite pleasure, being a
poem only so far as this object is attained romance presenting
perceptible images with definite, poetry with indefinite sensations,
to which end music is an essential, since the comprehension of sweet
sound is our most indefinite conception music, when combined with a
pleasurable idea, is poetry music, without the idea, is simply music
the idea, without the music, is prose, from its very definitiveness
what was meant by the invective against him who had no music in his
soul?
to sum up this long rigmarole, i have, dear b, what you, no doubt,
perceive, for the metaphysical poets as poets, the most sovereign
contempt that they have followers proves nothing
no indian prince has to his palace
more followers than a thief to the gallows

such as the drowsy shepherd on his bed
of giant pasturage lying at his ease,
raising his heavy eyelid, starts and sees
with many a mutterd hope to be forgiven
what time the moon is quadrated in heaven
of rosy head, that towering far away
into the sunlit ether, caught the ray
of sunken suns at eveat noon of night,
while the moon dancd with the fair stranger light
upreard upon such height arose a pile
of gorgeous columns on th uuburthend air,
flashing from parian marble that twin smile
far down upon the wave that sparkled there,
and nursled the young mountain in its lair
of molten stars their pavement, such as fall
thro the ebon air, besilvering the pall
of their own dissolution, while they die
adorning then the dwellings of the sky
a dome, by linked light from heaven let down,
sat gently on these columns as a crown
a window of one circular diamond, there,
lookd out above into the purple air
and rays from god shot down that meteor chain
and hallowd all the beauty twice again,
save when, between th empyrean and that ring,
some eager spirit flappd his dusky wing
but on the pillars seraph eyes have seen
the dimness of this world that grayish green

that stole upon the ear, in eyraco ,
of many a wild stargazer long ago
that stealeth ever on the ear of him
who, musing, gazeth on the distance dim,
and sees the darkness coming as a cloud
is not its formits voicemost palpable and loud?
but what is this?it comethand it brings
a music with ittis the rush of wings
a pauseand then a sweeping, falling strain,
and nesace is in her halls again
from the wild energy of wanton haste
her cheeks were flushing, and her lips apart
the zone that clung around her gentle waist
had burst beneath the heaving of her heart
within the centre of that hall to breathe
she pausd and panted, zanthe all beneath,
the fairy light that kissd her golden hair
and longd to rest, yet could but sparkle there
young flowers were whispering in melody
to happy flowers that nightand tree to tree
fountains were gushing music as they fell
in many a starlit grove, or moonlight dell
yet silence came upon material things
fair flowers, bright waterfalls and angel wings
and sound alone that from the spirit sprang
bore burthen to the charm the maiden sang
neath bluebell or streamer
or tufted wild spray
that keeps, from the dreamer,
the moonbeam away

with halfclosing eyes,
on the stars which your wonder
hath drawn from the skies,

in violet bowers,

o how, without you, love

those kisses of true love
that lulld ye to rest

living love to cherish for the dead, and which, in some minds, resembles
the delirium of opium
the passionate excitement of love and the buoyancy of spirit attendant
upon intoxication are its less holy pleasuresthe price of which, to
those souls who make choice of al aaraaf as their residence after
life, is final death and annihilation

kind solace in a dying hour
such, father, is not now my theme
i will not madly deem that power
of earth may shrive me of the sin
unearthly pride hath revelled in
i have no time to dote or dream
you call it hopethat fire of fire
it is but agony of desire
if i can hopeo god i can
its fount is holiermore divine
i would not call thee fool, old man,
but such is not a gift of thine
know thou the secret of a spirit
bowed from its wild pride into shame
o yearning heart i did inherit
thy withering portion with the fame,
the searing glory which hath shone
amid the jewels of my throne,
halo of hell and with a pain
not hell shall make me fear again
o craving heart, for the lost flowers
and sunshine of my summer hours
the undying voice of that dead time,
with its interminable chime,
rings, in the spirit of a spell,
upon thy emptinessa knell
i have not always been as now
the fevered diadem on my brow
i claimed and won usurpingly
hath not the same fierce heirdom given
rome to the csarthis to me?
the heritage of a kingly mind,
and a proud spirit which hath striven
triumphantly with human kind
on mountain soil i first drew life
the mists of the taglay have shed
nightly their dews upon my head,
and, i believe, the winged strife
and tumult of the headlong air
have nestled in my very hair
so late from heaventhat dewit fell
mid dreams of an unholy night
upon me with the touch of hell,
while the red flashing of the light
from clouds that hung, like banners, oer,
appeared to my halfclosing eye
the pageantry of monarchy
and the deep trumpetthunders roar
came hurriedly upon me, telling
of human battle, where my voice,
my own voice, silly childwas swelling
o how my spirit would rejoice,
and leap within me at the cry
the battlecry of victory
the rain came down upon my head
unshelteredand the heavy wind
rendered me mad and deaf and blind
it was but man, i thought, who shed
laurels upon me and the rush
the torrent of the chilly air
gurgled within my ear the crush
of empireswith the captives prayer
the hum of suitorsand the tone
of flattery round a sovereigns throne
my passions, from that hapless hour,
usurped a tyranny which men
have deemed since i have reached to power,
my innate naturebe it so
but, father, there lived one who, then,
thenin my boyhoodwhen their fire
burned with a still intenser glow
for passion must, with youth, expire
een then who knew this iron heart
in womans weakness had a part
i have no wordsalasto tell
the loveliness of loving well
nor would i now attempt to trace
the more than beauty of a face
whose lineaments, upon my mind,
areshadows on th unstable wind
thus i remember having dwelt
some page of early lore upon,
with loitering eye, till i have felt
the letterswith their meaningmelt
to fantasieswith none
o, she was worthy of all love
love as in infancy was mine
twas such as angel minds above
might envy her young heart the shrine
on which my every hope and thought
were incensethen a goodly gift,
for they were childish and upright
pureas her young example taught
why did i leave it, and, adrift,
trust to the fire within, for light?
we grew in ageand lovetogether
roaming the forest, and the wild
my breast her shield in wintry weather
and, when the friendly sunshine smiled
and she would mark the opening skies,
i saw no heavenbut in her eyes
young loves first lesson isthe heart
for mid that sunshine, and those smiles,
when, from our little cares apart,
and laughing at her girlish wiles,
id throw me on her throbbing breast,
and pour my spirit out in tears
there was no need to speak the rest
no need to quiet any fears
of herwho asked no reason why,
but turned on me her quiet eye
yet more than worthy of the love
my spirit struggled with, and strove
when, on the mountain peak, alone,
ambition lent it a new tone
i had no beingbut in thee
the world, and all it did contain
in the earththe airthe sea
its joyits little lot of pain
that was new pleasurethe ideal,
dim, vanities of dreams by night
and dimmer nothings which were real
shadowsand a more shadowy light
parted upon their misty wings,
and, so, confusedly, became
thine image anda namea name
two separateyet most intimate things
i was ambitioushave you known
the passion, father? you have not
a cottager, i marked a throne
of half the world as all my own,
and murmured at such lowly lot
but, just like any other dream,
upon the vapor of the dew
my own had past, did not the beam
of beauty which did while it thro
the minutethe hourthe dayoppress
my mind with double loveliness
we walked together on the crown
of a high mountain which looked down
afar from its proud natural towers
of rock and forest, on the hills
the dwindled hills begirt with bowers
and shouting with a thousand rills
i spoke to her of power and pride,
but mysticallyin such guise
that she might deem it nought beside
the moments converse in her eyes
i read, perhaps too carelessly
a mingled feeling with my own
the flush on her bright cheek, to me
seemed to become a queenly throne
too well that i should let it be
light in the wilderness alone
i wrapped myself in grandeur then,
and donned a visionary crown
yet it was not that fantasy
had thrown her mantle over me
but that, among the rabblemen,
lion ambition is chained down
and crouches to a keepers hand
not so in deserts where the grand
the wildthe terrible conspire
with their own breath to fan his fire
look round thee now on samarcand
is she not queen of earth? her pride
above all cities? in her hand
their destinies? in all beside
of glory which the world hath known
stands she not nobly and alone?
fallingher veriest steppingstone
shall form the pedestal of a throne
and who her sovereign? timourhe
whom the astonished people saw
striding oer empires haughtily
a diademed outlaw
o, human love thou spirit given,
on earth, of all we hope in heaven
which fallst into the soul like rain
upon the sirocwithered plain,
and, failing in thy power to bless,
but leavst the heart a wilderness
idea which bindest life around
with music of so strange a sound
and beauty of so wild a birth
farewell for i have won the earth
when hope, the eagle that towered, could see
no cliff beyond him in the sky,
his pinions were bent droopingly
and homeward turned his softened eye
twas sunset when the sun will part
there comes a sullenness of heart
to him who still would look upon
the glory of the summer sun
that soul will hate the evning mist
so often lovely, and will list
to the sound of the coming darkness known
to those whose spirits hearken as one
who, in a dream of night, would fly,
but cannot, from a danger nigh
what tho the moontho the white moon
shed all the splendor of her noon,
her smile is chillyand her beam,
in that time of dreariness, will seem
so like you gather in your breath
a portrait taken after death
and boyhood is a summer sun
whose waning is the dreariest one
for all we live to know is known,
and all we seek to keep hath flown
let life, then, as the dayflower, fall
with the noonday beautywhich is all
i reached my homemy home no more
for all had flown who made it so
i passed from out its mossy door,
and, tho my tread was soft and low,
a voice came from the threshold stone
of one whom i had earlier known
o, i defy thee, hell, to show
on beds of fire that burn below,
an humbler hearta deeper woe
father, i firmly do believe
i knowfor death who comes for me
from regions of the blest afar,
where there is nothing to deceive,
hath left his iron gate ajar
and rays of truth you cannot see
are flashing thro eternity
i do believe that eblis hath
a snare in every human path
else how, when in the holy grove
i wandered of the idol, love,
who daily scents his snowy wings
with incense of burntofferings
from the most unpolluted things,
whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven
above with trellised rays from heaven
no mote may shunno tiniest fly
the lightning of his eagle eye
how was it that ambition crept,
unseen, amid the revels there,
till growing bold, he laughed and leapt
in the tangles of loves very hair


to helen
helen, thy beauty is to me
like those nicean barks of yore,
that gently, oer a perfumed sea,
the weary, wayworn wanderer bore
to his own native shore
on desperate seas long wont to roam,
thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,
thy naiad airs have brought me home
to the glory that was greece,
to the grandeur that was rome
lo in yon brilliant window niche,
how statuelike i see thee stand,
the agate lamp within thy hand
ah, psyche, from the regions which
are holy land


the valley of unrest
once it smiled a silent dell
where the people did not dwell
they had gone unto the wars,
trusting to the mildeyed stars,
nightly, from their azure towers,
to keep watch above the flowers,
in the midst of which all day
the red sunlight lazily lay,
now each visitor shall confess
the sad valleys restlessness
nothing there is motionless
nothing save the airs that brood
over the magic solitude
ah, by no wind are stirred those trees
that palpitate like the chill seas
around the misty hebrides
ah, by no wind those clouds are driven
that rustle through the unquiet heaven
unceasingly, from morn till even,
over the violets there that lie
in myriad types of the human eye
over the lilies that wave
and weep above a nameless grave
they wavefrom out their fragrant tops
eternal dews come down in drops
they weepfrom off their delicate stems
perennial tears descend in gems


israfel
in heaven a spirit doth dwell
whose heartstrings are a lute
none sing so wildly well
as the angel israfel,
and the giddy stars so legends tell,
ceasing their hymns, attend the spell
of his voice, all mute
tottering above
in her highest noon,
the enamoured moon
blushes with love,
while, to listen, the red levin
with the rapid pleiads, even,
which were seven,
pauses in heaven
and they say the starry choir
and the other listening things
that israfelis fire
is owing to that lyre
by which he sits and sings
the trembling living wire
of those unusual strings
but the skies that angel trod,
where deep thoughts are a duty
where loves a growup god
where the houri glances are
imbued with all the beauty
which we worship in a star
therefore, thou art not wrong,
israfeli, who despisest
an unimpassioned song
to thee the laurels belong,
best bard, because the wisest
merrily live and long
the ecstasies above
with thy burning measures suit
thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love,
with the fervor of thy lute
well may the stars be mute
yes, heaven is thine but this
is a world of sweets and sours
our flowers are merelyflowers,
and the shadow of thy perfect bliss
is the sunshine of ours
if i could dwell
where israfel
hath dwelt, and he where i,
he might not sing so wildly well
a mortal melody,
while a bolder note than this might swell
from my lyre within the sky

fair river in thy bright, clear flow
of crystal, wandering water,

but when within thy wave she looks

her image deeply lies

of her soulsearching eyes


song
i saw thee on thy bridal day
when a burning blush came oer thee,
though happiness around thee lay,
the world all love before thee
and in thine eye a kindling light
whatever it might be
was all on earth my aching sight
of loveliness could see
that blush, perhaps, was maiden shame
as such it well may pass
though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame
in the breast of him, alas
who saw thee on that bridal day,
when that deep blush would come oer thee,
though happiness around thee lay,
the world all love before thee


spirits of the dead
thy soul shall find itself alone
mid dark thoughts of the gray tombstone
not one, of all the crowd, to pry
into thine hour of secrecy
be silent in that solitude
which is not lonelinessfor then
the spirits of the dead who stood
in life before thee are again
in death around theeand their will
shall overshadow thee be still
the nighttho clearshall frown
and the stars shall not look down
from their high thrones in the heaven,
with light like hope to mortals given
but their red orbs, without beam,
to thy weariness shall seem
as a burning and a fever
which would cling to thee forever
now are thoughts thou shalt not banish
now are visions neer to vanish
from thy spirit shall they pass
no morelike dewdrops from the grass
the breezethe breath of godis still
and the mist upon the hill
shadowyshadowyyet unbroken,
is a symbol and a token
how it hangs upon the trees,
a mystery of mysteries


a dream
in visions of the dark night
i have dreamed of joy departed
but a waking dream of life and light
hath left me brokenhearted
ah what is not a dream by day
to him whose eyes are cast
on things around him with a ray
turned back upon the past?
that holy dreamthat holy dream,
while all the world were chiding,
hath cheered me as a lovely beam,
a lonely spirit guiding
what though that light, thro storm and night,
so trembled from afar
what could there be more purely bright
in truths day star?


romance
romance, who loves to nod and sing,
with drowsy head and folded wing,
among the green leaves as they shake
far down within some shadowy lake,
to me a painted paroquet
hath beena most familiar bird
taught me my alphabet to say
to lisp my very earliest word
while in the wild wood i did lie,
a childwith a most knowing eye
of late, eternal condor years
so shake the very heaven on high
with tumult as they thunder by,
i have no time for idle cares
though gazing on the unquiet sky
and when an hour with calmer wings
its down upon my spirit flings
that little time with lyre and rhyme
to while awayforbidden things
my heart would feel to be a crime
unless it trembled with the strings


fairyland
dim valesand shadowy floods
and cloudylooking woods,
whose forms we cant discover
for the tears that drip all over
huge moons there wax and wane
againagainagain
every moment of the night
forever changing places
and they put out the starlight
with the breath from their pale faces
about twelve by the moondial
one more filmy than the rest
a kind which, upon trial,
they have found to be the best
comes downstill downand down
with its centre on the crown
of a mountains eminence,
while its wide circumference
in easy drapery falls
over hamlets, over halls,
wherever they may be
oer the strange woodsoer the sea
over spirits on the wing
over every drowsy thing
and buries them up quite
in a labyrinth of light
and then, how deepo, deep
is the passion of their sleep
in the morning they arise,
and their moony covering
is soaring in the skies,
with the tempests as they toss,
likealmost any thing
or a yellow albatross
they use that moon no more
for the same end as before
videlicet a tent
which i think extravagant
its atomies, however,
into a shower dissever,
of which those butterflies,
of earth, who seek the skies,
and so come down again
nevercontented thing
have brought a specimen
upon their quivering wings


the lake
in spring of youth it was my lot
to haunt of the wide world a spot
the which i could not love the less
so lovely was the loneliness
of a wild lake, with black rock bound,
and the tall pines that towered around
but when the night had thrown her pall
upon the spot, as upon all,
and the mystic wind went by
murmuring in melody
thenah, then, i would awake
to the terror of the lone lake
yet that terror was not fright,
but a tremulous delight
a feeling not the jewelled mine
could teach or bribe me to define
nor lovealthough the love were thine
death was in that poisonous wave,
and in its gulf a fitting grave
for him who thence could solace bring
to his lone imagining
whose solitary soul could make
an eden of that dim lake


evening star
twas noontide of summer,
and midtime of night,
and stars, in their orbits,
shone pale, through the light
of the brighter, cold moon
mid planets her slaves,
herself in the heavens,
her beam on the waves
i gazed awhile
on her cold smile
too coldtoo cold for me
there passed, as a shroud,
a fleecy cloud,
and i turned away to thee,
proud evening star,
in thy glory afar
and dearer thy beam shall be
for joy to my heart
is the proud part
thou bearest in heaven at night,
and more i admire
thy distant fire,
than that colder, lowly light


imitation
a dark unfathomed tide
of interminable pride
a mystery, and a dream,
should my early life seem
i say that dream was fraught
with a wild and waking thought
of beings that have been,
which my spirit hath not seen,
had i let them pass me by,
with a dreaming eye
let none of earth inherit
that vision on my spirit
those thoughts i would control,
as a spell upon his soul
for that bright hope at last
and that light time have past,
and my wordly rest hath gone
with a sigh as it passed on
i care not though it perish
with a thought i then did cherish


the happiest day
i       the happiest daythe happiest hour

but let them pass

a soul that knew it well


translation from the greek
hymn to aristogeiton and harmodius
i      wreathed in myrtle, my sword ill conceal,
like those champions devoted and brave,
when they plunged in the tyrant their steel,
and to athens deliverance gave
ii     beloved heroes your deathless souls roam
in the joy breathing isles of the blest
where the mighty of old have their home
where achilles and diomed rest

when he made at the tutelar shrine
a libation of tyrannys blood
iv     ye deliverers of athens from shame
ye avengers of libertys wrongs
endless ages shall cherish your fame,
embalmed in their echoing songs

my spirit not awakening, till the beam
of an eternity should bring the morrow
yes though that long dream were of hopeless sorrow,

notes
on the poems written in youth little comment is needed this
section includes the pieces printed for the first volume of  which
was subsequently suppressed, such poems from the first and second
published volumes of  and  as have not already been given in
their revised versions, and a few others collected from various sources
al aaraaf first appeared, with the sonnet to silence prefixed to it,
in , and is, substantially, as originally issued in the edition for
, however, this poem, its authors longest, was introduced by the
following twentynine lines, which have been omitted in all subsequent
collections
al aaraaf
mysterious star
thou wert my dream
all a long summer night
be now my theme
by this clear stream,
of thee will i write
meantime from afar
bathe me in light
thy world has not the dross of ours,
yet all the beautyall the flowers
that list our love or deck our bowers
in dreamy gardens, where do lie
dreamy maidens all the day
while the silver winds of circassy
on violet couches faint away
littleoh little dwells in thee
like unto what on earth we see
beautys eye is here the bluest
in the falsest and untruest
on the sweetest air doth float
the most sad and solemn note
if with thee be broken hearts,
joy so peacefully departs,
that its echo still doth dwell,
like the murmur in the shell
thou thy truest type of grief
is the gently falling leaf
thou thy framing is so holy
sorrow is not melancholy

the earliest version of tamerlane was included in the suppressed
volume of , but differs very considerably from the poem as now
published the present draft, besides innumerable verbal alterations and
improvements upon the original, is more carefully punctuated, and, the
lines being indented, presents a more pleasing appearance, to the eye at
least

to helen first appeared in the  volume, as did also the
valley of unrest as the valley nis, israfel, and one or two
others of the youthful pieces
the poem styled romance constituted the preface of the  volume,
but with the addition of the following lines
succeeding years, too wild for song,
then rolled like tropic storms along,
where, though the garish lights that fly
dying along the troubled sky,
lay bare, through vistas thunderriven,
the blackness of the general heaven,
that very blackness yet doth fling
light on the lightnings silver wing
for being an idle boy lang syne,
who read anacreon and drank wine,
i early found anacreon rhymes
were almost passionate sometimes
and by strange alchemy of brain
his pleasures always turned to pain
his navet to wild desire
his wit to lovehis wine to fire
and so, being young and dipt in folly,
i fell in love with melancholy
and used to throw my earthly rest
and quiet all away in jest
i could not love except where death
was mingling his with beautys breath
or hymen, time, and destiny,
were stalking between her and me

but now my soul hath too much room
gone are the glory and the gloom
the black hath mellowd into gray,
and all the fires are fading away
my draught of passion hath been deep
i revelld, and i now would sleep
and after drunkenness of soul
succeeds the glories of the bowl
an idle longing night and day
to dream my very life away
but dreamsof those who dream as i,
aspiringly, are damned, and die
yet should i swear i mean alone,
by notes so very shrilly blown,
to break upon times monotone,
while yet my vapid joy and grief
are tintless of the yellow leaf
why not an imp the greybeard hath,
will shake his shadow in my path
and een the greybeard will oerlook
connivingly my dreamingbook

thy classic brow, like lilies white
and pale as the imperial night
upon her throne, with stars bedight,
enthralled my soul to thee
iii     ah ever i behold
thy dreamy, passionate eyes,
blue as the languid skies
hung with the sunsets fringe of gold
now strangely clear thine image grows,
and olden memories
are startled from their long repose
like shadows on the silent snows
when suddenly the nightwind blows
where quiet moonlight lies
iv      like music heard in dreams,
like strains of harps unknown,
of birds for ever flown,
audible as the voice of streams
that murmur in some leafy dell,
i hear thy gentlest tone,
and silence cometh with her spell
like that which on my tongue doth dwell,
when tremulous in dreams i tell
my love to thee alone
v       in every valley heard,
floating from tree to tree,
less beautiful to me,
the music of the radiant bird,
than artless accents such as thine
whose echoes never flee
ah how for thy sweet voice i pine
for uttered in thy tones benign
enchantress this rude name of mine
doth seem a melody

the village street
in these rapid, restless shadows,
once i walked at eventide,
when a gentle, silent maiden,
walked in beauty at my side
she alone there walked beside me
all in beauty, like a bride
pallidly the moon was shining
on the dewy meadows nigh
on the silvery, silent rivers,
on the mountains far and high,
on the oceans starlit waters,
where the winds aweary die
slowly, silently we wandered
from the open cottage door,
underneath the elms long branches
to the pavement bending oer
underneath the mossy willow
and the dying sycamore
with the myriad stars in beauty
all bedight, the heavens were seen,
radiant hopes were bright around me,
like the light of stars serene
like the mellow midnight splendor
of the nights irradiate queen
audibly the elmleaves whispered
peaceful, pleasant melodies,
like the distant murmured music
of unquiet, lovely seas
while the winds were hushed in slumber
in the fragrant flowers and trees
wondrous and unwonted beauty
still adorning all did seem,
while i told my love in fables
neath the willows by the stream
would the heart have kept unspoken
love that was its rarest dream
instantly away we wandered
in the shadowy twilight tide,
she, the silent, scornful maiden,
walking calmly at my side,
with a step serene and stately,
all in beauty, all in pride
vacantly i walked beside her
on the earth mine eyes were cast
swift and keen there came unto me
bitter memories of the past
on me, like the rain in autumn
on the dead leaves, cold and fast
underneath the elms we parted,
by the lowly cottage door
one brief word alone was uttered
never on our lips before
and away i walked forlornly,
brokenhearted evermore
slowly, silently i loitered,
homeward, in the night, alone
sudden anguish bound my spirit,
that my youth had never known
wild unrest, like that which cometh
when the nights first dream hath flown
now, to me the elmleaves whisper
mad, discordant melodies,
and keen melodies like shadows
haunt the moaning willow trees,
and the sycamores with laughter
mock me in the nightly breeze
sad and pale the autumn moonlight
through the sighing foliage streams
and each morning, midnight shadow,
shadow of my sorrow seems
strive, o heart, forget thine idol
and, o soul, forget thy dreams

the forest reverie
tis said that when
the hands of men
tamed this primeval wood,
and hoary trees with groans of wo,
like warriors by an unknown foe,
were in their strength subdued,
the virgin earth
gave instant birth
to springs that neer did flow
that in the sun
did rivulets run,
and all around rare flowers did blow
the wild rose pale
perfumed the gale,
and the queenly lily adown the dale
whom the sun and the dew
and the winds did woo,
with the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew
so when in tears
the love of years
is wasted like the snow,
and the fine fibrils of its life
by the rude wrong of instant strife
are broken at a blow
within the heart
do springs upstart
of which it doth now know,
and strange, sweet dreams,
like silent streams
that from new fountains overflow,
with the earlier tide
of rivers glide
deep in the heart whose hope has died
quenching the fires its ashes hide,
its ashes, whence will spring and grow
sweet flowers, ere long,
the rare and radiant flowers of song

notes
of the many verses from time to time ascribed to the pen of edgar poe,
and not included among his known writings, the lines entitled alone
have the chief claim to our notice facsimile copies of this piece
had been in possession of the present editor some time previous to its
publication in scribners magazine for september  but as proofs
of the authorship claimed for it were not forthcoming, he refrained from
publishing it as requested the desired proofs have not yet been
adduced, and there is, at present, nothing but internal evidence to
guide us alone is stated to have been written by poe in the album of
a baltimore lady mrs balderstone?, on march th, , and the
facsimile given in scribners is alleged to be of his handwriting
if the caligraphy be poes, it is different in all essential respects
from all the many specimens known to us, and strongly resembles that of
the writer of the heading and dating of the manuscript, both of which
the contributor of the poem acknowledges to have been recently added
the lines, however, if not by poe, are the most successful imitation of
his early mannerisms yet made public, and, in the opinion of one well
qualified to speak, are not unworthy on the whole of the parentage
claimed for them
whilst edgar poe was editor of the broadway journal, some lines to
isadore appeared therein, and, like several of his known pieces, bore
no signature they were at once ascribed to poe, and in order to satisfy
questioners, an editorial paragraph subsequently appeared, saying they
were by a ide, junior two previous poems had appeared in the
broadway journal over the signature of a m ide, and whoever wrote
them was also the author of the lines to isadore in order, doubtless,
to give a show of variety, poe was then publishing some of his known
works in his journal over noms de plume, and as no other writings
whatever can be traced to any person bearing the name of a m ide, it
is not impossible that the poems now republished in this collection may
be by the author of the raven having been published without his usual
elaborate revision, poe may have wished to hide his hasty work under an
assumed name the three pieces are included in the present collection,
so the reader can judge for himself what pretensions they possess to be
by the author of the raven

prose poems

the island of the fay
nullus enim locus sine genio est
servius
la musique, says marmontel, in those contes moraux which in all
our translations we have insisted upon calling moral tales, as if in
mockery of their spiritla musique est le seul des talens qui jouisse
de luimeme tous les autres veulent des temoins he here confounds
the pleasure derivable from sweet sounds with the capacity for creating
them no more than any other talent, is that for music susceptible of
complete enjoyment where there is no second party to appreciate its
exercise and it is only in common with other talents that it produces
effects which may be fully enjoyed in solitude the idea which the
raconteur has either failed to entertain clearly, or has sacrificed in
its expression to his national love of point, is doubtless the very
tenable one that the higher order of music is the most thoroughly
estimated when we are exclusively alone the proposition in this form
will be admitted at once by those who love the lyre for its own sake and
for its spiritual uses but there is one pleasure still within the reach
of fallen mortality, and perhaps only one, which owes even more than
does music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion i mean the happiness
experienced in the contemplation of natural scenery in truth, the man
who would behold aright the glory of god upon earth must in solitude
behold that glory to me at least the presence, not of human life only,
but of life, in any other form than that of the green things which grow
upon the soil and are voiceless, is a stain upon the landscape, is at
war with the genius of the scene i love, indeed, to regard the dark
valleys, and the gray rocks, and the waters that silently smile, and the
forests that sigh in uneasy slumbers, and the proud watchful mountains
that look down upon all,i love to regard these as themselves but the
colossal members of one vast animate and sentient wholea whole whose
form that of the sphere is the most perfect and most inclusive of all
whose path is among associate planets whose meek handmaiden is the
moon whose mediate sovereign is the sun whose life is eternity whose
thought is that of a god whose enjoyment is knowledge whose destinies
are lost in immensity whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our
own cognizance of the animalcul which infest the brain, a being which
we in consequence regard as purely inanimate and material, much in the
same manner as these animalcul must thus regard us
our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on every
hand, notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the priesthood,
that space, and therefore that bulk, is an important consideration in
the eyes of the almighty the cycles in which the stars move are those
best adapted for the evolution, without collision, of the greatest
possible number of bodies the forms of those bodies are accurately such
as within a given surface to include the greatest possible amount of
matter while the surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodate
a denser population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces
otherwise arranged nor is it any argument against bulk being an object
with god that space itself is infinite for there may be an infinity of
matter to fill it and since we see clearly that the endowment of matter
with vitality is a principleindeed, as far as our judgments extend,
the leading principle in the operations of deity, it is scarcely
logical to imagine it confined to the regions of the minute, where we
daily trace it, and not extending to those of the august as we find
cycle within cycle without end, yet all revolving around one fardistant
centre which is the godhead, may we not analogically suppose, in the
same manner, life within life, the less within the greater, and all
within the spirit divine? in short, we are madly erring through
selfesteem in believing man, in either his temporal or future
destinies, to be of more moment in the universe than that vast clod of
the valley which he tills and contemns, and to which he denies a soul,
for no more profound reason than that he does not behold it in operation

these fancies, and such as these, have always given to my meditations
among the mountains and the forests, by the rivers and the ocean, a
tinge of what the everyday world would not fail to term the fantastic
my wanderings amid such scenes have been many and farsearching, and
often solitary and the interest with which i have strayed through many
a dim deep valley, or gazed into the reflected heaven of many a bright
lake, has been an interest greatly deepened by the thought that i have
strayed and gazed alone what flippant frenchman  was it who said,
in allusion to the well known work of zimmermann, that la solitude est
une belle chose mais il faut quelquun pour vous dire que la solitude
est une belle chose? the epigram cannot be gainsaid but the necessity
is a thing that does not exist
it was during one of my lonely journeyings, amid a far distant region of
mountain locked within mountain, and sad rivers and melancholy tarns
writhing or sleeping within all, that i chanced upon a certain rivulet
and island i came upon them suddenly in the leafy june, and threw
myself upon the turf beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub,
that i might doze as i contemplated the scene i felt that thus only
should i look upon it, such was the character of phantasm which it wore
on all sides, save to the west where the sun was about sinking, arose
the verdant walls of the forest the little river which turned sharply
in its course, and was thus immediately lost to sight, seemed to have no
exit from its prison, but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage of
the trees to the east while in the opposite quarter so it appeared to
me as i lay at length and glanced upward there poured down noiselessly
and continuously into the valley a rich golden and crimson waterfall
from the sunset fountains of the sky
about midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in, one
small circular island, profusely verdured, reposed upon the bosom of the
stream
so blended bank and shadow there,
that each seemed pendulous in air
so mirrorlike was the glassy water, that it was scarcely possible to
say at what point upon the slope of the emerald turf its crystal
dominion began my position enabled me to include in a single view both
the eastern and western extremities of the islet, and i observed a
singularlymarked difference in their aspects the latter was all one
radiant harem of garden beauties it glowed and blushed beneath the eye
of the slant sunlight, and fairly laughed with flowers the grass was
short, springy, sweetscented, and asphodelinterspersed the trees were
lithe, mirthful, erect, bright, slender, and graceful, of eastern figure
and foliage, with bark smooth, glossy, and particolored there seemed a
deep sense of life and joy about all, and although no airs blew from out
the heavens, yet everything had motion through the gentle sweepings to
and fro of innumerable butterflies, that might have been mistaken for
tulips with wings
the other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest shade
a sombre, yet beautiful and peaceful gloom, here pervaded all things
the trees were dark in color and mournful in form and attitude
wreathing themselves into sad, solemn, and spectral shapes, that
conveyed ideas of mortal sorrow and untimely death the grass wore the
deep tint of the cypress, and the heads of its blades hung droopingly,
and hither and thither among it were many small unsightly hillocks, low
and narrow, and not very long, that had the aspect of graves, but were
not, although over and all about them the rue and the rosemary
clambered the shades of the trees fell heavily upon the water, and
seemed to bury itself therein, impregnating the depths of the element
with darkness i fancied that each shadow, as the sun descended lower
and lower, separated itself sullenly from the trunk that gave it birth,
and thus became absorbed by the stream, while other shadows issued
momently from the trees, taking the place of their predecessors thus
entombed
this idea having once seized upon my fancy greatly excited it, and i
lost myself forthwith in reverie if ever island were enchanted, said
i to myself, this is it this is the haunt of the few gentle fays who
remain from the wreck of the race are these green tombs theirs?or do
they yield up their sweet lives as mankind yield up their own? in dying,
do they not rather waste away mournfully, rendering unto god little by
little their existence, as these trees render up shadow after shadow,
exhausting their substance unto dissolution? what the wasting tree is to
the water that imbibes its shade, growing thus blacker by what it preys
upon, may not the life of the fay be to the death which engulfs it?
as i thus mused, with halfshut eyes, while the sun sank rapidly to
rest, and eddying currents careered round and round the island, bearing
upon their bosom large dazzling white flakes of the bark of the
sycamore, flakes which, in their multiform positions upon the water, a
quick imagination might have converted into anything it pleased while i
thus mused, it appeared to me that the form of one of those very fays
about whom i had been pondering, made its way slowly into the darkness
from out the light at the western end of the island she stood erect in
a singularly fragile canoe, and urged it with the mere phantom of an
oar while within the influence of the lingering sunbeams, her attitude
seemed indicative of joy, but sorrow deformed it as she passed within
the shade slowly she glided along, and at length rounded the islet and
reentered the region of light the revolution which has just been made
by the fay, continued i musingly, is the cycle of the brief year of
her life she has floated through her winter and through her summer she
is a year nearer unto death for i did not fail to see that as she came
into the shade, her shadow fell from her, and was swallowed up in the
dark water, making its blackness more black
and again the boat appeared and the fay, but about the attitude of the
latter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic joy
she floated again from out the light and into the gloom which deepened
momently, and again her shadow fell from her into the ebony water, and
became absorbed into its blackness and again and again she made the
circuit of the island while the sun rushed down to his slumbers, and
at each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person,
while it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct, and at each
passage into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade, which became
whelmed in a shadow more black but at length, when the sun had utterly
departed, the fay, now the mere ghost of her former self, went
disconsolately with her boat into the region of the ebony flood, and
that she issued thence at all i cannot say, for darkness fell over all
things, and i beheld her magical figure no more

the power of words
oinos
pardon, agathos, the weakness of a spirit newfledged with
immortality
agathos
you have spoken nothing, my oinos, for which pardon is to be demanded
not even here is knowledge a thing of intuition for wisdom, ask of
the angels freely, that it may be given
oinos
but in this existence i dreamed that i should be at once cognizant of
all things, and thus at once happy in being cognizant of all
agathos
ah, not in knowledge is happiness, but in the acquisition of
knowledge in forever knowing, we are forever blessed but to know
all, were the curse of a fiend
oinos
but does not the most high know all?
agathos
that since he is the most happy must be still the one thing
unknown even to him
oinos
but, since we grow hourly in knowledge, must not at last all things
be known?
agathos
look down into the abysmal distancesattempt to force the gaze down
the multitudinous vistas of the stars, as we sweep slowly through them
thusand thusand thus even the spiritual vision, is it not at all
points arrested by the continuous golden walls of the universe?the
walls of the myriads of the shining bodies that mere number has
appeared to blend into unity?
oinos
i clearly perceive that the infinity of matter is no dream
agathos
there are no dreams in aidennbut it is here whispered that, of this
infinity of matter, the sole purpose is to afford infinite springs
at which the soul may allay the thirst to know which is forever
unquenchable within itsince to quench it would be to extinguish the
souls self question me then, my oinos, freely and without fear
come we will leave to the left the loud harmony of the pleiades, and
swoop outward from the throne into the starry meadows beyond orion,
where, for pansies and violets, and heartsease, are the beds of the
triplicate and tripletinted suns
oinos
and now, agathos, as we proceed, instruct mespeak to me in the
earths familiar tones i understand not what you hinted to me just
now of the modes or of the methods of what during mortality, we were
accustomed to call creation do you mean to say that the creator is
not god?
agathos
i mean to say that the deity does not create
oinos
explain
agathos
in the beginning only, he created the seeming creatures which are now
throughout the universe so perpetually springing into being can only
be considered as the mediate or indirect, not as the direct or
immediate results of the divine creative power
oinos
among men, my agathos, this idea would be considered heretical in the
extreme
agathos
among the angels, my oinos, it is seen to be simply true
oinos
i can comprehend you thus farthat certain operations of what we term
nature, or the natural laws, will, under certain conditions, give rise
to that which has all the appearance of creation shortly before the
final overthrow of the earth, there were, i well remember, many very
successful experiments in what some philosophers were weak enough to
denominate the creation of animalcul
agathos
the cases of which you speak were, in fact, instances of the secondary
creation, and of the only species of creation which has ever been
since the first word spoke into existence the first law
oinos
are not the starry worlds that, from the abyss of nonentity, burst
hourly forth into the heavensare not these stars, agathos, the
immediate handiwork of the king?
agathos
let me endeavor, my oinos, to lead you, step by step, to the
conception i intend you are well aware that, as no thought can
perish, so no act is without infinite result we moved our hands, for
example, when we were dwellers on the earth, and in so doing we gave
vibration to the atmosphere which engirdled it this vibration was
indefinitely extended till it gave impulse to every particle of the
earths air, which thenceforward, and forever, was actuated by the
one movement of the hand this fact the mathematicians of our globe
well knew they made the special effects, indeed, wrought in the fluid
by special impulses, the subject of exact calculationso that it
became easy to determine in what precise period an impulse of given
extent would engirdle the orb, and impress forever every atom of the
atmosphere circumambient retrograding, they found no difficulty from
a given effect, under given conditions, in determining the value of
the original impulse now the mathematicians who saw that the results
of any given impulse were absolutely endlessand who saw that a
portion of these results were accurately traceable through the agency
of algebraic analysiswho saw, too, the facility of the
retrogradationthese men saw, at the same time, that this species of
analysis itself had within itself a capacity for indefinite
progressthat there were no bounds conceivable to its advancement and
applicability, except within the intellect of him who advanced or
applied it but at this point our mathematicians paused
oinos
and why, agathos, should they have proceeded?
agathos
because there were some considerations of deep interest beyond it was
deducible from what they knew, that to a being of infinite
understandingone to whom the perfection of the algebraic analysis
lay unfoldedthere could be no difficulty in tracing every impulse
given the airand the ether through the airto the remotest
consequences at any even infinitely remote epoch of time it is indeed
demonstrable that every such impulse given the air, must in the
end impress every individual thing that exists within the
universeand the being of infinite understandingthe being whom
we have imaginedmight trace the remote undulations of the
impulsetrace them upward and onward in their influences upon all
particles of all matterupward and onward forever in their
modifications of old formsor, in other words, in their creation of
newuntil he found them reflectedunimpressive at lastback from
the throne of the godhead and not only could such a being do this,
but at any epoch, should a given result be afforded himshould one of
these numberless comets, for example, be presented to his
inspectionhe could have no difficulty in determining, by the
analytic retrogradation, to what original impulse it was due this
power of retrogradation in its absolute fulness and perfectionthis
faculty of referring at all epochs, all effects to all
causesis of course the prerogative of the deity alonebut in every
variety of degree, short of the absolute perfection, is the power
itself exercised by the whole host of the angelic intelligences
oinos
but you speak merely of impulses upon the air
agathos
in speaking of the air, i referred only to the earth but the general
proposition has reference to impulses upon the etherwhich, since it
pervades, and alone pervades all space, is thus the great medium of
creation
oinos
then all motion, of whatever nature, creates?
agathos
it must but a true philosophy has long taught that the source of all
motion is thoughtand the source of all thought is
oinos
god
agathos
i have spoken to you, oinos, as to a child, of the fair earth which
lately perishedof impulses upon the atmosphere of the earth
oinos
you did
agathos
and while i thus spoke, did there not cross your mind some thought of
the physical power of words? is not every word an impulse on the
air?
oinos
but why, agathos, do you weepand why, oh, why do your wings droop as
we hover above this fair starwhich is the greenest and yet most
terrible of all we have encountered in our flight? its brilliant
flowers look like a fairy dreambut its fierce volcanoes like the
passions of a turbulent heart
agathos
they arethey arethis wild starit is now three centuries
since, with clasped hands, and with streaming eyes, at the feet of my
belovedi spoke itwith a few passionate sentencesinto birth its
brilliant flowers are the dearest of all unfulfilled dreams, and its
raging volcanoes are the passions of the most turbulent and
unhallowed of hearts

born again?
monos
yes, fairest and best beloved una, born again these were the words
upon whose mystical meaning i had so long pondered, rejecting the
explanations of the priesthood, until death itself resolved for me the
secret
una
death
monos
how strangely, sweet una, you echo my words i observe, too, a
vacillation in your step, a joyous inquietude in your eyes you are
confused and oppressed by the majestic novelty of the life eternal
yes, it was of death i spoke and here how singularly sounds that word
which of old was wont to bring terror to all hearts, throwing a mildew
upon all pleasures
una
ah, death, the spectre which sate at all feasts how often, monos, did
we lose ourselves in speculations upon its nature how mysteriously
did it act as a check to human bliss, saying unto it, thus far, and
no farther that earnest mutual love, my own monos, which burned
within our bosoms, how vainly did we flatter ourselves, feeling happy
in its first upspringing that our happiness would strengthen with its
strength alas, as it grew, so grew in our hearts the dread of that
evil hour which was hurrying to separate us forever thus in time it
became painful to love hate would have been mercy then
monos
speak not here of these griefs, dear unamine, mine forever now
una
but the memory of past sorrow, is it not present joy? i have much to
say yet of the things which have been above all, i burn to know the
incidents of your own passage through the dark valley and shadow
monos
and when did the radiant una ask anything of her monos in vain? i will
be minute in relating all, but at what point shall the weird narrative
begin?
una
at what point?
monos
you have said
una
monos, i comprehend you in death we have both learned the propensity
of man to define the indefinable i will not say, then, commence with
the moment of lifes cessationbut commence with that sad, sad
instant when, the fever having abandoned you, you sank into a
breathless and motionless torpor, and i pressed down your pallid
eyelids with the passionate fingers of love
monos
one word first, my una, in regard to mans general condition at this
epoch you will remember that one or two of the wise among our
forefatherswise in fact, although not in the worlds esteemhad
ventured to doubt the propriety of the term improvement, as applied
to the progress of our civilization there were periods in each of the
five or six centuries immediately preceding our dissolution when arose
some vigorous intellect, boldly contending for those principles whose
truth appears now, to our disenfranchised reason, so utterly obvious
principles which should have taught our race to submit to the
guidance of the natural laws rather than attempt their control at
long intervals some masterminds appeared, looking upon each advance
in practical science as a retrogradation in the true utility
occasionally the poetic intellectthat intellect which we now feel to
have been the most exalted of allsince those truths which to us were
of the most enduring importance could only be reached by that
analogy which speaks in prooftones to the imagination alone, and to
the unaided reason bears no weightoccasionally did this poetic
intellect proceed a step farther in the evolving of the vague idea of
the philosophic, and find in the mystic parable that tells of the tree
of knowledge, and of its forbidden fruit, deathproducing, a distinct
intimation that knowledge was not meet for man in the infant condition
of his soul and these menthe poetsliving and perishing amid the
scorn of the utilitariansof rough pedants, who arrogated to
themselves a title which could have been properly applied only to the
scornedthese men, the poets, pondered piningly, yet not unwisely,
upon the ancient days when our wants were not more simple than our
enjoyments were keendays when mirth was a word unknown, so
solemnly deeptoned was happinessholy, august, and blissful days,
blue rivers ran undammed, between hills unhewn, into far forest
solitudes, primeval, odorous, and unexplored yet these noble
exceptions from the general misrule served but to strengthen it by
opposition alas we had fallen upon the most evil of all our evil
days the great movementthat was the cant termwent on a
diseased commotion, moral and physical artthe artsarose supreme,
and once enthroned, cast chains upon the intellect which had elevated
them to power man, because he could not but acknowledge the majesty
of nature, fell into childish exultation at his acquired and
stillincreasing dominion over her elements even while he stalked a
god in his own fancy, an infantine imbecility came over him as might
be supposed from the origin of his disorder, he grew infected with
system, and with abstraction he enwrapped himself in generalities
among other odd ideas, that of universal equality gained ground and
in the face of analogy and of godin despite of the loud warning
voice of the laws of gradation so visibly pervading all things in
earth and heavenwild attempts at an omniprevalent democracy were
made yet this evil sprang necessarily from the leading evil,
knowledge man could not both know and succumb meantime huge smoking
cities arose, innumerable green leaves shrank before the hot breath
of furnaces the fair face of nature was deformed as with the ravages
of some loathsome disease and methinks, sweet una, even our
slumbering sense of the forced and of the farfetched might have
arrested us here but now it appears that we had worked out our own
destruction in the perversion of our taste, or rather in the blind
neglect of its culture in the schools for, in truth, it was at this
crisis that taste alonethat faculty which, holding a middle position
between the pure intellect and the moral sense, could never safely
have been disregardedit was now that taste alone could have led us
gently back to beauty, to nature, and to life but alas for the pure
contemplative spirit and majestic intuition of plato alas for the
greek mousichae  which he justly regarded as an allsufficient
education for the soul alas for him and for itsince both were most
desperately needed, when both were most entirely forgotten or despised
pascal, a philosopher whom we both love, has said, how
trulyque tout notre raisonnement se rduit  cder au
sentiment and it is not impossible that the sentiment of the
natural, had time permitted it, would have regained its old ascendency
over the harsh mathematical reason of the schools but this thing was
not to be prematurely induced by intemperance of knowledge, the old
age of the world drew near this the mass of mankind saw not, or,
living lustily although unhappily, affected not to see but, for
myself, the earths records had taught me to look for widest ruin as
the price of highest civilization i had imbibed a prescience of our
fate from comparison of china the simple and enduring, with assyria
the architect, with egypt the astrologer, with nubia, more crafty than
either, the turbulent mother of all arts in the history of these
regions i met with a ray from the future the individual
artificialities of the three latter were local diseases of the earth,
and in their individual overthrows we had seen local remedies applied
but for the infected world at large i could anticipate no regeneration
save in death that man, as a race, should not become extinct, i saw
that he must be born again
and now it was, fairest and dearest, that we wrapped our spirits,
daily, in dreams now it was that, in twilight, we discoursed of the

una
well do i remember these conversations, dear monos but the epoch of
the fiery overthrow was not so near at hand as we believed, and as the
corruption you indicate did surely warrant us in believing men lived
and died individually you yourself sickened, and passed into the
grave and thither your constant una speedily followed you and though
the century which has since elapsed, and whose conclusion brings up
together once more, tortured our slumbering senses with no impatience
of duration, yet my monos, it was a century still
monos
say, rather, a point in the vague infinity unquestionably, it was in
the earths dotage that i died wearied at heart with anxieties which
had their origin in the general turmoil and decay, i succumbed to the
fierce fever after some few days of pain, and many of dreamy delirium
replete with ecstasy, the manifestations of which you mistook for
pain, while i longed but was impotent to undeceive youafter some
days there came upon me, as you have said, a breathless and motionless
torpor and this was termed death by those who stood around me
words are vague things my condition did not deprive me of sentience
it appeared to me not greatly dissimilar to the extreme quiescence of
him, who, having slumbered long and profoundly, lying motionless and
fully prostrate in a midsummer noon, begins to steal slowly back into
consciousness, through the mere sufficiency of his sleep, and without
being awakened by external disturbances
i breathed no longer the pulses were still the heart had ceased to
beat volition had not departed, but was powerless the senses were
unusually active, although eccentrically soassuming often each
others functions at random the taste and the smell were inextricably
confounded, and became one sentiment, abnormal and intense the
rosewater with which your tenderness had moistened my lips to the
last, affected me with sweet fancies of flowersfantastic flowers,
far more lovely than any of the old earth, but whose prototypes we
have here blooming around us the eyelids, transparent and bloodless,
offered no complete impediment to vision as volition was in abeyance,
the balls could not roll in their socketsbut all objects within the
range of the visual hemisphere were seen with more or less
distinctness the rays which fell upon the external retina, or into
the corner of the eye, producing a more vivid effect than those which
struck the front or interior surface yet, in the former instance,
this effect was so far anomalous that i appreciated it only as
soundsound sweet or discordant as the matters presenting
themselves at my side were light or dark in shadecurved or angular
in outline the hearing, at the same time, although excited in degree,
was not irregular in actionestimating real sounds with an
extravagance of precision, not less than of sensibility touch had
undergone a modification more peculiar its impressions were tardily
received, but pertinaciously retained, and resulted always in the
highest physical pleasure thus the pressure of your sweet fingers
upon my eyelids, at first only recognized through vision, at length,
long after their removal, filled my whole being with a sensual delight
immeasurable i say with a sensual delight all my perceptions were
purely sensual the materials furnished the passive brain by the
senses were not in the least degree wrought into shape by the deceased
understanding of pain there was some little of pleasure there was
much but of moral pain or pleasure none at all thus your wild sobs
floated into my ear with all their mournful cadences, and were
appreciated in their every variation of sad tone but they were soft
musical sounds and no more they conveyed to the extinct reason no
intimation of the sorrows which gave them birth while large and
constant tears which fell upon my face, telling the bystanders of a
heart which broke, thrilled every fibre of my frame with ecstasy
alone and this was in truth the death of which these bystanders
spoke reverently, in low whispersyou, sweet una, gaspingly, with
loud cries
they attired me for the coffinthree or four dark figures which
flitted busily to and fro as these crossed the direct line of my
vision they affected me as forms but upon passing to my side their
images impressed me with the idea of shrieks, groans, and, other
dismal expressions of terror, of horror, or of woe you alone, habited
in a white robe, passed in all directions musically about
the day waned and, as its light faded away, i became possessed by a
vague uneasinessan anxiety such as the sleeper feels when sad real
sounds fall continuously within his earlow distant belltones,
solemn, at long but equal intervals, and commingling with melancholy
dreams night arrived and with its shadows a heavy discomfort it
oppressed my limbs with the oppression of some dull weight, and was
palpable there was also a moaning sound, not unlike the distant
reverberation of surf, but more continuous, which, beginning with the
first twilight, had grown in strength with the darkness suddenly
lights were brought into the rooms, and this reverberation became
forthwith interrupted into frequent unequal bursts of the same sound,
but less dreary and less distinct the ponderous oppression was in a
great measure relieved and, issuing from the flame of each lamp for
there were many, there flowed unbrokenly into my ears a strain of
melodious monotone and when now, dear una, approaching the bed upon
which i lay outstretched, you sat gently by my side, breathing odor
from your sweet lips, and pressing them upon my brow, there arose
tremulously within my bosom, and mingling with the merely physical
sensations which circumstances had called forth, a something akin to
sentiment itselfa feeling that, half appreciating, half responded
to your earnest love and sorrow but this feeling took no root in the
pulseless heart, and seemed indeed rather a shadow than a reality, and
faded quickly away, first into extreme quiescence, and then into a
purely sensual pleasure as before
and now, from the wreck and the chaos of the usual senses, there
appeared to have arisen within me a sixth, all perfect in its
exercise i found a wild delightyet a delight still physical,
inasmuch as the understanding had in it no part motion in the animal
frame had fully ceased no muscle quivered no nerve thrilled no
artery throbbed but there seemed to have sprung up in the brain
that of which no words could convey to the merely human intelligence
even an indistinct conception let me term it a mental pendulous
pulsation it was the moral embodiment of mans abstract idea of
time by the absolute equalization of this movementor of such as
thishad the cycles of the firmamental orbs themselves been adjusted
by its aid i measured the irregularities of the clock upon the mantel,
and of the watches of the attendants their tickings came sonorously
to my ears the slightest deviations from the true proportionand
these deviations were omniprevalentaffected me just as violations of
abstract truth were wont on earth to affect the moral sense although
no two of the timepieces in the chamber struck the individual seconds
accurately together, yet i had no difficulty in holding steadily in
mind the tones, and the respective momentary errors of each and
thisthis keen, perfect selfexisting sentiment of durationthis
sentiment existing as man could not possibly have conceived it to
exist independently of any succession of eventsthis ideathis
sixth sense, upspringing from the ashes of the rest, was the first
obvious and certain step of the intemporal soul upon the threshold of
the temporal eternity
it was midnight and you still sat by my side all others had departed
from the chamber of death they had deposited me in the coffin the
lamps burned flickeringly for this i knew by the tremulousness of the
monotonous strains but suddenly these strains diminished in
distinctness and in volume finally they ceased the perfume in my
nostrils died away forms affected my vision no longer the oppression
of the darkness uplifted itself from my bosom a dull shot like that
of electricity pervaded my frame, and was followed by total loss of
the idea of contact all of what man has termed sense was merged in
the sole consciousness of entity, and in the one abiding sentiment of
duration the mortal body had been at length stricken with the hand of
the deadly decay
yet had not all of sentience departed for the consciousness and the
sentiment remaining supplied some of its functions by a lethargic
intuition i appreciated the direful change now in operation upon the
flesh, and, as the dreamer is sometimes aware of the bodily presence
of one who leans over him, so, sweet una, i still dully felt that you
sat by my side so, too, when the noon of the second day came, i was
not unconscious of those movements which displaced you from my side,
which confined me within the coffin, which deposited me within the
hearse, which bore me to the grave, which lowered me within it, which
heaped heavily the mould upon me, and which thus left me, in blackness
and corruption, to my sad and solemn slumbers with the worm
and here in the prisonhouse which has few secrets to disclose, there
rolled away days and weeks and months and the soul watched narrowly
each second as it flew, and, without effort, took record of its
flightwithout effort and without object
a year passed the consciousness of being had grown hourly more
indistinct, and that of mere locality had in great measure usurped
its position the idea of entity was becoming merged in that of
place the narrow space immediately surrounding what had been the
body was now growing to be the body itself at length, as often
happens to the sleeper by sleep and its world alone is death
imagedat length, as sometimes happened on earth to the deep
slumberer, when some flitting light half startled him into awaking,
yet left him half enveloped in dreamsso to me, in the strict embrace
of the shadow, came that light which alone might have had power to
startlethe light of enduring love men toiled at the grave in
which i lay darkling they upthrew the damp earth upon my mouldering
bones there descended the coffin of una and now again all was void
that nebulous light had been extinguished that feeble thrill had
vibrated itself into quiescence many lustra had supervened dust
had returned to dust the worm had food no more the sense of being
had at length utterly departed, and there reigned in its stead
instead of all things, dominant and perpetualthe autocrats place
and time for that which was notfor that which had no
formfor that which had no thoughtfor that which had no
sentiencefor that which was soundless, yet of which matter formed no
portionfor all this nothingness, yet for all this immortality, the
grave was still a home, and the corrosive hours, comates
footnote
it will be hard to discover a better method of education than that
which the experience of so many ages has already discovered and this
may be summed up as consisting in gymnastics for the body, and
music for the soul
repub lib
for this reason is a musical education most essential since it
causes rhythm and harmony to penetrate most intimately into the soul,
taking the strongest hold upon it, filling it with beauty and making
the man beautifulminded  he will praise and admire the
beautiful, will receive it with joy into his soul, will feed upon it,
and assimilate his own condition with it
ibid lib  music had, however, among the athenians, a far more
comprehensive signification than with us it included not only the
harmonies of time and of tune, but the poetic diction, sentiment and
creation, each in its widest sense the study of music was with them,

eiros
mourned, charmion?oh, deeply to that last hour of all there hung a
cloud of intense gloom and devout sorrow over your household
charmion
and that last hourspeak of it remember that, beyond the naked fact
of the catastrophe itself, i know nothing when, coming out from among
mankind, i passed into night through the graveat that period, if i
remember aright, the calamity which overwhelmed you was utterly
unanticipated but, indeed, i knew little of the speculative
philosophy of the day
eiros
the individual calamity was, as you say, entirely unanticipated but
analogous misfortunes had been long a subject of discussion with
astronomers i need scarce tell you, my friend, that, even when you
left us, men had agreed to understand those passages in the most holy
writings which speak of the final destruction of all things by fire as
having reference to the orb of the earth alone, but in regard to the
immediate agency of the ruin, speculation had been at fault from that
epoch in astronomical knowledge in which the comets were divested of
the terrors of flame the very moderate density of these bodies had
been well established they had been observed to pass among the
satellites of jupiter without bringing about any sensible alteration
either in the masses or in the orbits of these secondary planets we
had long regarded the wanderers as vapory creations of inconceivable
tenuity, and as altogether incapable of doing injury to our
substantial globe, even in the event of contact but contact was not
in any degree dreaded for the elements of all the comets were
accurately known that among them we should look for the agency of
the threatened fiery destruction had been for many years considered an
inadmissible idea but wonders and wild fancies had been of late days
strangely rife among mankind and, although it was only with a few of
the ignorant that actual apprehension prevailed, upon the announcement
by astronomers of a new comet, yet this announcement was generally
received with i know not what of agitation and mistrust
the elements of the strange orb were immediately calculated, and it
was at once conceded by all observers that its path, at perihelion
would bring it into very close proximity with the earth there were
two or three astronomers of secondary note who resolutely maintained
that a contact was inevitable i cannot very well express to you the
effect of this intelligence upon the people for a few short days they
would not believe an assertion which their intellect, so long employed
among worldly considerations, could not in any manner grasp but the
truth of a vitally important fact soon makes its way into the
understanding of even the most stolid finally, all men saw that
astronomical knowledge lies not, and they awaited the comet its
approach was not at first seemingly rapid, nor was its appearance of
very unusual character it was of a dull red, and had little
perceptible train for seven or eight days we saw no material increase
in its apparent diameter, and but a partial alteration in its color
meantime, the ordinary affairs of men were discarded, and all interest
absorbed in a growing discussion instituted by the philosophic in
respect to the cometary nature even the grossly ignorant aroused
their sluggish capacities to such considerations the learned now
gave their intellecttheir soulto no such points as the allaying of
fear, or to the sustenance of loved theory they soughtthey panted
for right views they groaned for perfected knowledge truth arose
in the purity of her strength and exceeding majesty, and the wise
bowed down and adored
that material injury to our globe or to its inhabitants would result
from the apprehended contact was an opinion which hourly lost ground
among the wise and the wise were now freely permitted to rule the
reason and the fancy of the crowd it was demonstrated that the
density of the comets nucleus was far less than that of our rarest
gas and the harmless passage of a similar visitor among the
satellites of jupiter was a point strongly insisted upon, and which
served greatly to allay terror theologists, with an earnestness
fearenkindled, dwelt upon the biblical prophecies, and expounded them
to the people with a directness and simplicity of which no previous
instance had been known that the final destruction of the earth must
be brought about by the agency of fire, was urged with a spirit that
enforced everywhere conviction and that the comets were of no fiery
nature as all men now knew was a truth which relieved all, in a
great measure, from the apprehension of the great calamity foretold
it is noticeable that the popular prejudices and vulgar errors in
regard to pestilences and warserrors which were wont to prevail upon
every appearance of a cometwere now altogether unknown, as if by
some sudden convulsive exertion reason had at once hurled superstition
from her throne the feeblest intellect had derived vigor from
excessive interest
what minor evils might arise from the contact were points of elaborate
question the learned spoke of slight geological disturbances, of
probable alterations in climate, and consequently in vegetation of
possible magnetic and electric influences many held that no visible
or perceptible effect would in any manner be produced while such
discussions were going on, their subject gradually approached, growing
larger in apparent diameter, and of a more brilliant lustre mankind
grew paler as it came all human operations were suspended
there was an epoch in the course of the general sentiment when the
comet had attained, at length, a size surpassing that of any
previously recorded visitation the people now, dismissing any
lingering hope that the astronomers were wrong, experienced all the
certainty of evil the chimerical aspect of their terror was gone the
hearts of the stoutest of our race beat violently within their bosoms
a very few days suffered, however, to merge even such feelings in
sentiments more unendurable we could no longer apply to the strange
orb any accustomed thoughts its historical attributes had
disappeared it oppressed us with a hideous novelty of emotion we
saw it not as an astronomical phenomenon in the heavens, but as an
incubus upon our hearts and a shadow upon our brains it had taken,
with unconceivable rapidity, the character of a gigantic mantle of
rare flame, extending from horizon to horizon
yet a day, and men breathed with greater freedom it was clear that we
were already within the influence of the comet yet we lived we even
felt an unusual elasticity of frame and vivacity of mind the
exceeding tenuity of the object of our dread was apparent for all
heavenly objects were plainly visible through it meantime, our
vegetation had perceptibly altered and we gained faith, from this
predicted circumstance, in the foresight of the wise a wild
luxuriance of foliage, utterly unknown before, burst out upon every
vegetable thing
yet another dayand the evil was not altogether upon us it was now
evident that its nucleus would first reach us a wild change had come
over all men and the first sense of pain was the wild signal for
general lamentation and horror the first sense of pain lay in a
rigorous construction of the breast and lungs, and an insufferable
dryness of the skin it could not be denied that our atmosphere was
radically affected the conformation of this atmosphere and the
possible modifications to which it might be subjected, were now the
topics of discussion the result of investigation sent an electric
thrill of the intensest terror through the universal heart of man
it had been long known that the air which encircled us was a compound
of oxygen and nitrogen gases, in the proportion of twentyone measures
of oxygen and seventynine of nitrogen in every one hundred of the
atmosphere oxygen, which was the principle of combustion, and the
vehicle of heat, was absolutely necessary to the support of animal
life, and was the most powerful and energetic agent in nature
nitrogen, on the contrary, was incapable of supporting either animal
life or flame an unnatural excess of oxygen would result, it had been
ascertained, in just such an elevation of the animal spirits as we had
latterly experienced it was the pursuit, the extension of the idea,
which had engendered awe what would be the result of a total
extraction of the nitrogen? a combustion irresistible, alldevouring,
omniprevalent, immediatethe entire fulfilment, in all their
minute and terrible details, of the fiery and horrorinspiring
denunciations of the prophecies of the holy book
why need i paint, charmion, the now disenchained frenzy of mankind?
that tenuity in the comet which had previously inspired us with hope,
was now the source of the bitterness of despair in its impalpable
gaseous character we clearly perceived the consummation of fate
meantime a day again passedbearing away with it the last shadow of
hope we gasped in the rapid modification of the air the red blood
bounded tumultuously through its strict channels a furious delirium
possessed all men and with arms rigidly outstretched towards the
threatening heavens, they trembled and shrieked aloud but the nucleus
of the destroyer was now upon useven here in aidenn i shudder while
i speak let me be briefbrief as the ruin that overwhelmed for a
moment there was a wild lurid light alone, visiting and penetrating
all things thenlet us bow down, charmion, before the excessive
majesty of the great godthen, there came a shouting and pervading
sound, as if from the mouth itself of him while the whole incumbent
mass of ether in which we existed, burst at once into a species of
intense flame, for whose surpassing brilliancy and allfervid heat
even the angels in the high heaven of pure knowledge have no name
thus ended all

shadowa parable
yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow
psalm of david
ye who read are still among the living but i who write shall have long
since gone my way into the region of shadows for indeed strange things
shall happen, and secret things be known, and many centuries shall pass
away, ere these memorials be seen of men and, when seen, there will be
some to disbelieve and some to doubt, and yet a few who will find much
to ponder upon in the characters here graven with a stylus of iron
the year had been a year of terror, and of feeling more intense than
terror for which there is no name upon the earth for many prodigies and
signs had taken place, and far and wide, over sea and land, the black
wings of the pestilence were spread abroad to those, nevertheless,
cunning in the stars, it was not unknown that the heavens wore an aspect
of ill and to me, the greek oinos, among others, it was evident that
now had arrived the alternation of that seven hundred and ninetyfourth
year when, at the entrance of aries, the planet jupiter is enjoined with
the red ring of the terrible saturnus the peculiar spirit of the skies,
if i mistake not greatly, made itself manifest, not only in the physical
orb of the earth, but in the souls, imaginations, and meditations of
mankind
over some flasks of the red chian wine, within the walls of a noble
hall, in a dim city called ptolemais, we sat, at night, a company of
seven and to our chamber there was no entrance save by a lofty door of
brass and the door was fashioned by the artisan corinnos, and, being of
rare workmanship, was fastened from within black draperies, likewise in
the gloomy room, shut out from our view the moon, the lurid stars, and
the peopleless streetsbut the boding and the memory of evil, they
would not be so excluded there were things around us and about of which
i can render no distinct accountthings material and spiritual
heaviness in the atmospherea sense of suffocationanxietyand, above
all, that terrible state of existence which the nervous experience when
the senses are keenly living and awake, and meanwhile the powers of
thought lie dormant a dead weight hung upon us it hung upon our
limbsupon the household furnitureupon the goblets from which we
drank and all things were depressed, and borne down therebyall things
save only the flames of the seven iron lamps which illumined our revel
uprearing themselves in tall slender lines of light, they thus remained
burning all pallid and motionless and in the mirror which their lustre
formed upon the round table of ebony at which we sat each of us there
assembled beheld the pallor of his own countenance, and the unquiet
glare in the downcast eyes of his companions yet we laughed and were
merry in our proper waywhich was hysterical and sang the songs of
anacreonwhich are madness and drank deeplyalthough the purple wine
reminded us of blood for there was yet another tenant of our chamber in
the person of young zoilus dead and at full length he lay,
enshroudedthe genius and the demon of the scene alas he bore no
portion in our mirth, save that his countenance, distorted with the
plague, and his eyes in which death had but half extinguished the fire
of the pestilence, seemed to take such an interest in our merriment as
the dead may haply take in the merriment of those who are to die but
although i, oinos, felt that the eyes of the departed were upon me,
still i forced myself not to perceive the bitterness of their
expression, and gazing down steadily into the depths of the ebony
mirror, sang with a loud and sonorous voice the songs of the son of
teos but gradually my songs they ceased, and their echoes, rolling afar
off among the sable draperies of the chamber, became weak, and
undistinguishable, and so faded away and lo from among those sable
draperies, where the sounds of the song departed, there came forth a
dark and undefiled shadowa shadow such as the moon, when low in
heaven, might fashion from the figure of a man but it was the shadow
neither of man nor of god, nor of any familiar thing and quivering
awhile among the draperies of the room it at length rested in full view
upon the surface of the door of brass but the shadow was vague, and
formless, and indefinite, and was the shadow neither of man nor
godneither god of greece, nor god of chalda, nor any egyptian god
and the shadow rested upon the brazen doorway, and under the arch of the
entablature of the door and moved not, nor spoke any word, but there
became stationary and remained and the door whereupon the shadow rested
was, if i remember aright, over against the feet of the young zoilus
enshrouded but we, the seven there assembled, having seen the shadow as
it came out from among the draperies, dared not steadily behold it, but
cast down our eyes, and gazed continually into the depths of the mirror
of ebony and at length i, oinos, speaking some low words, demanded of
the shadow its dwelling and its appellation and the shadow answered, i
am shadow, and my dwelling is near to the catacombs of ptolemais, and
hard by those dim plains of helusion which border upon the foul
charonian canal and then did we, the seven, start from our seats in
horror, and stand trembling, and shuddering, and aghast for the tones
in the voice of the shadow were not the tones of any one being, but of a
multitude of beings, and varying in their cadences from syllable to
syllable, fell duskily upon our ears in the well remembered and familiar
accents of many thousand departed friends

silencea fable
the mountain pinnacles slumber valleys, crags, and caves are silent
listen to me, said the demon, as he placed his hand upon my head
the region of which i speak is a dreary region in libya, by the borders
of the river zire and there is no quiet there, nor silence
the waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue and they flow
not onward to the sea, but palpitate forever and forever beneath the red
eye of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive motion for many miles
on either side of the rivers oozy bed is a pale desert of gigantic
waterlilies they sigh one unto the other in that solitude, and stretch
towards the heaven their long and ghastly necks, and nod to and fro
their everlasting heads and there is an indistinct murmur which cometh
out from among them like the rushing of subterrene water and they sigh
one unto the other
but there is a boundary to their realmthe boundary of the dark,
horrible, lofty forest there, like the waves about the hebrides, the
low underwood is agitated continually but there is no wind throughout
the heaven and the tall primeval trees rock eternally hither and
thither with a crashing and mighty sound and from their high summits,
one by one, drop everlasting dews and at the roots, strange poisonous
flowers lie writhing in perturbed slumber and overhead, with a rustling
and loud noise, the gray clouds rush westwardly forever until they roll,
a cataract, over the fiery wall of the horizon but there is no wind
throughout the heaven and by the shores of the river zire there is
neither quiet nor silence
it was night, and the rain fell and, falling, it was rain, but, having
fallen, it was blood and i stood in the morass among the tall lilies,
and the rain fell upon my headand the lilies sighed one unto the other
in the solemnity of their desolation
and, all at once, the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist, and was
crimson in color and mine eyes fell upon a huge gray rock which stood
by the shore of the river and was lighted by the light of the moon and
the rock was gray and ghastly, and tall,and the rock was gray upon
its front were characters engraven in the stones and i walked through
the morass of waterlilies, until i came close unto the shore, that i
might read the characters upon the stone but i could not decipher them
and i was going back into the morass when the moon shone with a fuller
red, and i turned and looked again upon the rock and upon the
charactersand the characters were desolation
and i looked upwards, and there stood a man upon the summit of the
rock and i hid myself among the waterlilies that i might discover the
action of the man and the man was tall and stately in form, and wrapped
up from his shoulders to his feet in the toga of old rome and the
outlines of his figure were indistinctbut his features were the
features of a deity for the mantle of the night, and of the mist, and
of the moon, and of the dew, had left uncovered the features of his
face and his brow was lofty with thought, and his eye wild with care
and in the few furrows upon his cheek, i read the fables of sorrow, and
weariness, and disgust with mankind, and a longing after solitude
and the man sat upon the rock, and leaned his head upon his hand, and
looked out upon the desolation he looked down into the low unquiet
shrubbery, and up into the tall primeval trees, and up higher at the
rustling heaven, and into the crimson moon and i lay close within
shelter of the lilies, and observed the actions of the man and the man
trembled in the solitudebut the night waned, and he sat upon the
rock
and the man turned his attention from the heaven, and looked out upon
the dreary river zire, and upon the yellow ghastly waters, and upon the
pale legions of the waterlilies and the man listened to the sighs of
the waterlilies, and to the murmur that came up from among them and i
lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man and the
man trembled in the solitudebut the night waned, and he sat upon the
rock
then i went down into the recesses of the morass, and waded afar in
among the wilderness of the lilies, and called unto the hippopotami
which dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the morass and the
hippopotami heard my call, and came, with the behemoth, unto the foot of
the rock, and roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon and i lay
close within my covert and observed the actions of the man and the man
trembled in the solitudebut the night waned, and he sat upon the
rock
then i cursed the elements with the curse of tumult and a frightful
tempest gathered in the heaven, where before there had been no wind and
the heaven became livid with the violence of the tempestand the rain
beat upon the head of the manand the floods of the river came
downand the river was tormented into foamand the waterlilies
shrieked within their bedsand the forest crumbled before the windand
the thunder rolledand the lightning felland the rock rocked to its
foundation and i lay close within my covert and observed the actions of
the man and the man trembled in the solitudebut the night waned, and
he sat upon the rock
then i grew angry and cursed, with the curse of silence, the river, and
the lilies, and the wind, and the forest, and the heaven, and the
thunder, and the sighs of the waterlilies and they became accursed,
and were still and the moon ceased to totter up its pathway to
heavenand the thunder died awayand the lightning did not flashand
the clouds hung motionlessand the waters sunk to their level and
remainedand the trees ceased to rockand the waterlilies sighed no

essays

the poetic principle
in speaking of the poetic principle, i have no design to be either
thorough or profound while discussing very much at random the
essentiality of what we call poetry, my principal purpose will be to
cite for consideration some few of those minor english or american poems
which best suit my own taste, or which, upon my own fancy, have left the
most definite impression by minor poems i mean, of course, poems of
little length and here, in the beginning, permit me to say a few words
in regard to a somewhat peculiar principle, which, whether rightfully or
wrongfully, has always had its influence in my own critical estimate of
the poem i hold that a long poem does not exist i maintain that the
phrase, a long poem, is simply a flat contradiction in terms
i need scarcely observe that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as
it excites, by elevating the soul the value of the poem is in the ratio
of this elevating excitement but all excitements are, through a psychal
necessity, transient that degree of excitement which would entitle a
poem to be so called at all, cannot be sustained throughout a
composition of any great length after the lapse of half an hour, at the
very utmost, it flagsfailsa revulsion ensuesand then the poem is,
in effect, and in fact, no longer such
there are, no doubt, many who have found difficulty in reconciling the
critical dictum that the paradise lost is to be devoutly admired
throughout, with the absolute impossibility of maintaining for it,
during perusal, the amount of enthusiasm which that critical dictum
would demand this great work, in fact, is to be regarded as poetical
only when, losing sight of that vital requisite in all works of art,
unity, we view it merely as a series of minor poems if, to preserve its
unityits totality of effect or impressionwe read it as would be
necessary at a single sitting, the result is but a constant alternation
of excitement and depression after a passage of what we feel to be true
poetry, there follows, inevitably, a passage of platitude which no
critical prejudgment can force us to admire but if, upon completing the
work, we read it again omitting the first bookthat is to say,
commencing with the secondwe shall be surprised at now finding that
admirable which we before condemnedthat damnable which we had
previously so much admired it follows from all this that the ultimate,
aggregate, or absolute effect of even the best epic under the sun, is a
nullityand this is precisely the fact
in regard to the iliad, we have, if not positive proof, at least very
good reason, for believing it intended as a series of lyrics but,
granting the epic intention, i can say only that the work is based in an
imperfect sense of art the modern epic is, of the supposititious
ancient model, but an inconsiderate and blindfold imitation but the day
of these artistic anomalies is over if, at any time, any very long poem
were popular in realitywhich i doubtit is at least clear that no
very long poem will ever be popular again
that the extent of a poetical work is ceteris paribus, the measure of
its merit, seems undoubtedly, when we thus state it, a proposition
sufficiently absurdyet we are indebted for it to the quarterly
reviews surely there can be nothing in mere size, abstractly
consideredthere can be nothing in mere bulk, so far as a volume is
concerned, which has so continuously elicited admiration from these
saturnine pamphlets a mountain, to be sure, by the mere sentiment of
physical magnitude which it conveys, does impress us with a sense of
the sublimebut no man is impressed after this fashion by the
material grandeur of even the columbiad even the quarterlies have not
instructed us to be so impressed by it as yet, they have not
insisted on our estimating lamartine by the cubic foot, or pollock by
the poundbut what else are we to infer from their continual prating
about sustained effort? if, by sustained effort, any little
gentleman has accomplished an epic, let us frankly commend him for the
effortif this indeed be a thing commendablebut let us forbear
praising the epic on the efforts account it is to be hoped thai common
sense, in the time to come, will prefer deciding upon a work of art
rather by the impression it makesby the effect it producesthan by
the time it took to impress the effect, or by the amount of sustained
effort which had been found necessary in effecting the impression the
fact is, that perseverance is one thing and genius quite anothernor
can all the quarterlies in christendom confound them by and by, this
proposition, with many which i have been just urging, will be received
as selfevident in the meantime, by being generally condemned as
falsities, they will not be essentially damaged as truths
on the other hand, it is clear that a poem may be improperly brief
undue brevity degenerates into mere epigrammatism a very short poem,
while now and then producing a brilliant or vivid, never produces a
profound or enduring effect there must be the steady pressing down of
the stamp upon the wax de branger has wrought innumerable things,
pungent and spiritstirring, but in general they have been too
imponderous to stamp themselves deeply into the public attention, and
thus, as so many feathers of fancy, have been blown aloft only to be
whistled down the wind
a remarkable instance of the effect of undue brevity in depressing a
poem, in keeping it out of the popular view, is afforded by the
following exquisite little serenade
i arise from dreams of thee
in the first sweet sleep of night
when the winds are breathing low,
and the stars are shining bright
i arise from dreams of thee,
and a spirit in my feet
has led mewho knows how?
to thy chamberwindow, sweet
the wandering airs they faint
on the dark the silent stream
the champak odors fail
like sweet thoughts in a dream
the nightingales complaint,
it dies upon her heart,
as i must die on thine,
o, beloved as thou art
o, lift me from the grass
i die, i faint, i fail
let thy love in kisses rain
on my lips and eyelids pale
my cheek is cold and white, alas
my heart beats loud and fast
o, press it close to thine again,
where it will break at last
very few perhaps are familiar with these lines, yet no less a poet than
shelley is their author their warm, yet delicate and ethereal
imagination will be appreciated by all, but by none so thoroughly as by
him who has himself arisen from sweet dreams of one beloved to bathe in
the aromatic air of a southern midsummer night
one of the finest poems by willis, the very best in my opinion which he
has ever written, has no doubt, through this same defect of undue
brevity, been kept back from its proper position, not less in the
critical than in the popular view
the shadows lay along broadway,
twas near the twilighttide
and slowly there a lady fair
was walking in her pride
alone walkd she but, viewlessly
walkd spirits at her side
peace charmd the street beneath her feet,
and honor charmd the air
and all astir looked kind on her,
and called her good as fair
for all god ever gave to her
she kept with chary care
she kept with care her beauties rare
from lovers warm and true
for heart was cold to all but gold,
and the rich came not to woo
but honord well her charms to sell,
if priests the selling do
now walking there was one more fair
a slight girl, lilypale
and she had unseen company
to make the spirit quail
twixt want and scorn she walkd forlorn,
and nothing could avail
no mercy now can clear her brow
from this worlds peace to pray,
for as loves wild prayer dissolved in air,
her womans heart gave way
but the sin forgiven by christ in heaven,
by man is cursed alway
in this composition we find it difficult to recognise the willis who has
written so many mere verses of society the lines are not only richly
ideal but full of energy, while they breathe an earnestness, an evident
sincerity of sentiment, for which we look in vain throughout all the
other works of this author
while the epic mania, while the idea that to merit in poetry prolixity
is indispensable, has for some years past been gradually dying out of
the public mind, by mere dint of its own absurdity, we find it succeeded
by a heresy too palpably false to be long tolerated, but one which, in
the brief period it has already endured, may be said to have
accomplished more in the corruption of our poetical literature than all
its other enemies combined i allude to the heresy of the didactic it
has been assumed, tacitly and avowedly, directly and indirectly, that
the ultimate object of all poetry is truth every poem, it is said,
should inculcate a moral, and by this moral is the poetical merit of the
work to be adjudged we americans especially have patronized this happy
idea, and we bostonians very especially have developed it in full we
have taken it into our heads that to write a poem simply for the poems
sake, and to acknowledge such to have been our design, would be to
confess ourselves radically wanting in the true poetic dignity and
forcebut the simple fact is that would we but permit ourselves to
look into our own souls we should immediately there discover that under
the sun there neither exists nor can exist any work more thoroughly
dignified, more supremely noble, than this very poem, this poem per
se, this poem which is a poem and nothing more, this poem written
solely for the poems sake
with as deep a reverence for the true as ever inspired the bosom of man,
i would nevertheless limit, in some measure, its modes of inculcation i
would limit to enforce them i would not enfeeble them by dissipation
the demands of truth are severe she has no sympathy with the myrtles
all that which is so indispensable in song is precisely all that
with which she has nothing whatever to do it is but making her a
flaunting paradox to wreathe her in gems and flowers in enforcing a
truth we need severity rather than efflorescence of language we must be
simple, precise, terse we must be cool, calm, unimpassioned in a word,
we must be in that mood which, as nearly as possible, is the exact
converse of the poetical he must be blind indeed who does not
perceive the radical and chasmal difference between the truthful and the
poetical modes of inculcation he must be theorymad beyond redemption
who, in spite of these differences, shall still persist in attempting to
reconcile the obstinate oils and waters of poetry and truth
dividing the world of mind into its three most immediately obvious
distinctions, we have the pure intellect, taste, and the moral sense i
place taste in the middle because it is just this position which in the
mind it occupies it holds intimate relations with either extreme but
from the moral sense is separated by so faint a difference that
aristotle has not hesitated to place some of its operations among the
virtues themselves nevertheless we find the offices of the trio
marked with a sufficient distinction just as the intellect concerns
itself with truth, so taste informs us of the beautiful, while the moral
sense is regardful of duty of this latter, while conscience teaches the
obligation, and reason the expediency, taste contents herself with
displaying the charms, waging war upon vice solely on the ground of her
deformity, her disproportion, her animosity to the fitting, to the
appropriate, to the harmonious, in a word, to beauty
an immortal instinct deep within the spirit of man is thus plainly a
sense of the beautiful this it is which administers to his delight in
the manifold forms, and sounds, and odors, and sentiments amid which he
exists and just as the lily is repeated in the lake, or the eyes of
amaryllis in the mirror, so is the mere oral or written repetition of
these forms, and sounds, and colors, and odors, and sentiments a
duplicate source of delight but this mere repetition is not poetry he
who shall simply sing, with however glowing enthusiasm, or with however
vivid a truth of description, of the sights, and sounds, and odors, and
colors, and sentiments which greet him in common with all mankindhe, i
say, has yet failed to prove his divine title there is still a
something in the distance which he has been unable to attain we have
still a thirst unquenchable, to allay which he has not shown us the
crystal springs this thirst belongs to the immortality of man it is at
once a consequence and an indication of his perennial existence it is
the desire of the moth for the star it is no mere appreciation of the
beauty before us, but a wild effort to reach the beauty above inspired
by an ecstatic prescience of the glories beyond the grave, we struggle
by multiform combinations among the things and thoughts of time to
attain a portion of that loveliness whose very elements perhaps
appertain to eternity alone and thus when by poetry, or when by music,
the most entrancing of the poetic moods, we find ourselves melted into
tears, we weep then, not as the abbate gravina supposes, through excess
of pleasure, but through a certain petulant, impatient sorrow at our
inability to grasp now, wholly, here on earth, at once and forever,
those divine and rapturous joys of which through the poem, or
through the music, we attain to but brief and indeterminate glimpses
the struggle to apprehend the supernal lovelinessthis struggle, on the
part of souls fittingly constitutedhas given to the world all that
which it the world has ever been enabled at once to understand and to
feel as poetic
the poetic sentiment, of course, may develop itself in various modesin
painting, in sculpture, in architecture, in the dancevery especially
in musicand very peculiarly, and with a wide field, in the composition
of the landscape garden our present theme, however, has regard only to
its manifestation in words and here let me speak briefly on the topic
of rhythm contenting myself with the certainty that music, in its
various modes of metre, rhythm, and rhyme, is of so vast a moment in
poetry as never to be wisely rejectedis so vitally important an
adjunct, that he is simply silly who declines its assistance, i will not
now pause to maintain its absolute essentiality it is in music perhaps
that the soul most nearly attains the great end for which, when inspired
by the poetic sentiment, it strugglesthe creation of supernal beauty
it may be, indeed, that here this sublime end is, now and, then,
attained in fact we are often made to feel, with a shivering delight,
that from an earthly harp are stricken notes which cannot have been
unfamiliar to the angels and thus there can be little doubt that in the
union of poetry with music in its popular sense, we shall find the
widest field for the poetic development the old bards and minnesingers
had advantages which we do not possessand thomas moore, singing his
own songs, was, in the most legitimate manner, perfecting them as poems
to recapitulate theni would define, in brief, the poetry of words as
the rhythmical creation of beauty its sole arbiter is taste with the
intellect or with the conscience it has only collateral relations
unless incidentally, it has no concern whatever either with duty or with
truth
a few words, however, in explanation that pleasure which is at once
the most pure, the most elevating, and the most intense, is derived, i
maintain, from the contemplation of the beautiful in the contemplation
of beauty we alone find it possible to attain that pleasurable
elevation, or excitement of the soul, which we recognize as the poetic
sentiment, and which is so easily distinguished from truth, which is the
satisfaction of the reason, or from passion, which is the excitement of
the heart i make beauty, thereforeusing the word as inclusive of the
sublimei make beauty the province of the poem, simply because it is an
obvious rule of art that effects should be made to spring as directly as
possible from their causesno one as yet having been weak enough to
deny that the peculiar elevation in question is at least most readily
attainable in the poem it by no means follows, however, that the
incitements of passion, or the precepts of duty, or even the lessons of
truth, may not be introduced into a poem, and with advantage for they
may subserve incidentally, in various ways, the general purposes of the
work but the true artist will always contrive to tone them down in
proper subjection to that beauty which is the atmosphere and the real
essence of the poem
i cannot better introduce the few poems which i shall present for your
consideration, than by the citation of the prem to longfellows waif
the day is done, and the darkness
falls from the wings of night,
as a feather is wafted downward
from an eagle in his flight
i see the lights of the village
gleam through the rain and the mist,
and a feeling of sadness comes oer me,
that my soul cannot resist
a feeling of sadness and longing,
that is not akin to pain,
and resembles sorrow only
as the mist resembles the rain
come, read to me some poem,
some simple and heartfelt lay,
that shall soothe this restless feeling,
and banish the thoughts of day
not from the grand old masters,
not from the bards sublime,
whose distant footsteps echo
through the corridors of time
for, like strains of martial music,
their mighty thoughts suggest
lifes endless toil and endeavor
and tonight i long for rest
read from some humbler poet,
whose songs gushed from his heart,
as showers from the clouds of summer,
or tears from the eyelids start
who through long days of labor,
and nights devoid of ease,
still heard in his soul the music
of wonderful melodies
such songs have power to quiet
the restless pulse of care,
and come like the benediction
that follows after prayer
then read from the treasured volume
the poem of thy choice,
and lend to the rhyme of the poet
the beauty of thy voice
and the night shall be filled with music,
and the cares that infest the day,
shall fold their tents like the arabs,
and as silently steal away
with no great range of imagination, these lines have been justly admired
for their delicacy of expression some of the images are very effective
nothing can be better than
the bards sublime,
whose distant footsteps echo
down the corridors of time
the idea of the last quatrain is also very effective the poem on the
whole, however, is chiefly to be admired for the graceful insouciance
of its metre, so well in accordance with the character of the
sentiments, and especially for the ease of the general manner this
ease or naturalness, in a literary style, it has long been the fashion
to regard as ease in appearance aloneas a point of really difficult
attainment but not soa natural manner is difficult only to him who
should never meddle with itto the unnatural it is but the result of
writing with the understanding, or with the instinct, that the tone,
in composition, should always be that which the mass of mankind would
adoptand must perpetually vary, of course, with the occasion the
author who, after the fashion of the north american review, should be
upon all occasions merely quiet, must necessarily upon many
occasions be simply silly, or stupid and has no more right to be
considered easy or natural than a cockney exquisite, or than the
sleeping beauty in the waxworks
among the minor poems of bryant, none has so much impressed me as the
one which he entitles june i quote only a portion of it
there, through the long, long summer hours,
the golden light should lie,
and thick young herbs and groups of flowers
stand in their beauty by
the oriole should build and tell
his lovetale, close beside my cell
the idle butterfly
should rest him there, and there be heard
the housewifebee and humming bird
and what, if cheerful shouts at noon,
come, from the village sent,
or songs of maids, beneath the moon,
with fairy laughter blent?
and what if, in the evening light,
betrothed lovers walk in sight
of my low monument?
i would the lovely scene around
might know no sadder sight nor sound
i know, i know i should not see
the seasons glorious show,
nor would its brightness shine for me
nor its wild music flow
but if, around my place of sleep,
the friends i love should come to weep,
they might not haste to go
soft airs and song, and light and bloom,
should keep them lingering by my tomb
these to their softend hearts should bear
the thought of what has been,
and speak of one who cannot share
the gladness of the scene
whose part in all the pomp that fills
the circuit of the summer hills,
isthat his grave is green
and deeply would their hearts rejoice
to hear again his living voice
the rhythmical flow here is even voluptuousnothing could be more
melodious the poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner the
intense melancholy which seems to well up, perforce, to the surface of
all the poets cheerful sayings about his grave, we find thrilling us to
the soulwhile there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill the
impression left is one of a pleasurable sadness and if, in the
remaining compositions which i shall introduce to you, there be more or
less of a similar tone always apparent, let me remind you that how or
why we know not this certain taint of sadness is inseparably connected
with all the higher manifestations of true beauty it is, nevertheless,
a feeling of sadness and longing
that is not akin to pain,
and resembles sorrow only
as the mist resembles the rain
the taint of which i speak is clearly perceptible even in a poem so full
of brilliancy and spirit as the health of edward coote pinkney
i fill this cup to one made up
of loveliness alone,
a woman, of her gentle sex
the seeming paragon
to whom the better elements
and kindly stars have given
a form so fair, that like the air,
tis less of earth than heaven
her every tone is musics own,
like those of morning birds,
and something more than melody
dwells ever in her words
the coinage of her heart are they,
and from her lips each flows
as one may see the burdend bee
forth issue from the rose
affections are as thoughts to her,
the measures of her hours
her feelings have the fragrancy,
the freshness of young flowers
and lovely passions, changing oft,
so fill her, she appears
the image of themselves by turns,
the idol of past years
of her bright face one glance will trace
a picture on the brain,
and of her voice in echoing hearts
a sound must long remain
but memory, such as mine of her,
so very much endears,
when death is nigh my latest sigh
will not be lifes, but hers
i filld this cup to one made up
of loveliness alone,
a woman, of her gentle sex
the seeming paragon
her health and would on earth there stood,
some more of such a frame,
that life might be all poetry,
and weariness a name
it was the misfortune of mr pinkney to have been born too far south
had he been a new englander, it is probable that he would have been
ranked as the first of american lyrists by that magnanimous cabal which
has so long controlled the destinies of american letters, in conducting
the thing called the north american review the poem just cited is
especially beautiful but the poetic elevation which it induces we must
refer chiefly to our sympathy in the poets enthusiasm we pardon his
hyperboles for the evident earnestness with which they are uttered
it was by no means my design, however, to expatiate upon the merits
of what i should read you these will necessarily speak for themselves
boccalina, in his advertisements from parnassus, tells us that zoilus
once presented apollo a very caustic criticism upon a very admirable
bookwhereupon the god asked him for the beauties of the work he
replied that he only busied himself about the errors on hearing this,
apollo, handing him a sack of unwinnowed wheat, bade him pick out all
the chaff for his reward
now this fable answers very well as a hit at the criticsbut i am by no
means sure that the god was in the right i am by no means certain that
the true limits of the critical duty are not grossly misunderstood
excellence, in a poem especially, may be considered in the light of an
axiom, which need only be properly put, to become selfevident it is
not excellence if it require to be demonstrated its suchand thus to
point out too particularly the merits of a work of art, is to admit that
they are not merits altogether
among the melodies of thomas moore is one whose distinguished
character as a poem proper seems to have been singularly left out of
view i allude to his lines beginningcome, rest in this bosom the
intense energy of their expression is not surpassed by anything in
byron there are two of the lines in which a sentiment is conveyed that
embodies the all in all of the divine passion of lovea sentiment
which, perhaps, has found its echo in more, and in more passionate,
human hearts that any other single sentiment ever embodied in words
come, rest in this bosom, my own stricken deer,
though the herd have fled from thee, thy home is still here
here still is the smile, that no cloud can oercast,
and a heart and a hand all thy own to the last
oh what was love made for, if tis not the same
through joy and through torment, through glory and shame?
i know not, i ask not, if guilts in that heart,
i but know that i love thee, whatever thou art
thou hast calld me thy angel in moments of bliss,
and thy angel ill be,mid the horrors of this,
through the furnace, unshrinking, thy steps to pursue,
and shield thee, and save thee,or perish there too
it has been the fashion of late days to deny moore imagination, while
granting him fancya distinction originating with coleridgethan whom
no man more fully comprehended the great powers of moore the fact is,
that the fancy of this poet so far predominates over all his other
faculties, and over the fancy of all other men, as to have induced, very
naturally, the idea that he is fanciful only but never was there a
greater mistake never was a grosser wrong done the fame of a true poet
in the compass of the english language i can call to mind no poem more
profoundlymore weirdly imaginative, in the best sense, than the
lines commencingi would i were by that dim lakewhich are the
composition of thomas moore i regret that i am unable to remember them
one of the noblestand, speaking of fancyone of the most singularly
fanciful of modern poets, was thomas hood his fair ines had always
for me an inexpressible charm
o saw ye not fair ines?
shes gone into the west,
to dazzle when the sun is down
and rob the world of rest
she took our daylight with her,
the smiles that we love best,
with morning blushes on her cheek,
and pearls upon her breast
o turn again, fair ines,
before the fall of night,
for fear the moon should shine alone,
and stars unrivalld bright
and blessed will the lover be
that walks beneath their light,
and breathes the love against thy cheek
i dare not even write
would i had been, fair ines,
that gallant cavalier,
who rode so gaily by thy side,
and whisperd thee so near
were there no bonny dames at home,
or no true lovers here,
that he should cross the seas to win
the dearest of the dear?
i saw thee, lovely ines,
descend along the shore,
with bands of noble gentlemen,
and bannerswaved before
and gentle youth and maidens gay,
and snowy plumes they wore
it would have been a beauteous dream,
if it had been no more
alas, alas, fair ines,
she went away with song,
with music waiting on her steps,
and shoutings of the throng
but some were sad and felt no mirth,
but only musics wrong,
in sounds that sang farewell, farewell,
to her youve loved so long
farewell, farewell, fair ines,
that vessel never bore
so fair a lady on its deck,
nor danced so light before,
alas for pleasure on the sea,
and sorrow on the shore
the smile that blest one lovers heart
has broken many more
the haunted house, by the same author, is one of the truest poems ever
written,one of the truest, one of the most unexceptionable, one of the
most thoroughly artistic, both in its theme and in its execution it is,
moreover, powerfully idealimaginative i regret that its length
renders it unsuitable for the purposes of this lecture in place of it
permit me to offer the universally appreciated bridge of sighs
one more unfortunate,
weary of breath,
rashly importunate
gone to her death
take her up tenderly,
lift her with care
fashiond so slenderly,
young and so fair
look at her garments
clinging like cerements
whilst the wave constantly
drips from her clothing
take her up instantly,
loving, not loathing
touch her not scornfully
think of her mournfully,
gently and humanly
not of the stains of her,
all that remains of her
now is pure womanly
make no deep scrutiny
into her mutiny
rash and undutiful
past all dishonor,
death has left on her
only the beautiful
where the lamps quiver
so far in the river,
with many a light
from window and casement,
from garret to basement,
she stood, with amazement,
houseless by night
the bleak wind of march
made her tremble and shiver
but not the dark arch,
or the black flowing river
mad from lifes history,
glad to deaths mystery,
swift to be hurld
anywhere, anywhere
out of the world
in she plunged boldly,
no matter how coldly
the rough river ran,
over the brink of it,
picture it,think of it,
dissolute man
lave in it, drink of it
then, if you can
still, for all slips of hers,
one of eves family
wipe those poor lips of hers
oozing so clammily,
loop up her tresses
escaped from the comb,
her fair auburn tresses
whilst wonderment guesses
where was her home?
who was her father?
who was her mother
had she a sister?
had she a brother?
or was there a dearer one
still, and a nearer one
yet, than all other?
alas for the rarity
of christian charity
under the sun
oh it was pitiful
near a whole city full,
home she had none
sisterly, brotherly,
fatherly, motherly,
feelings had changed
love, by harsh evidence,
thrown from its eminence
even gods providence
seeming estranged
take her up tenderly
lift her with care
fashiond so slenderly,
young, and so fair
ere her limbs frigidly
stiffen too rigidly,
decently,kindly,
smooth and compose them
and her eyes, close them,
staring so blindly
dreadfully staring
through muddy impurity,
as when with the daring
last look of despairing
fixed on futurity
perishing gloomily,
spurred by contumely,
cold inhumanity,
burning insanity,
into her rest,
cross her hands humbly,
as if praying dumbly,
over her breast
owning her weakness,
her evil behavior,
and leaving, with meekness,
her sins to her saviour
the vigor of this poem is no less remarkable than its pathos the
versification, although carrying the fanciful to the very verge of the
fantastic, is nevertheless admirably adapted to the wild insanity which
is the thesis of the poem
among the minor poems of lord byron is one which has never received from
the critics the praise which it undoubtedly deserves
though the day of my destinys over,
and the star of my fate hath declined,
thy soft heart refused to discover
the faults which so many could find
though thy soul with my grief was acquainted,
it shrunk not to share it with me,
and the love which my spirit hath painted
it never hath found but in thee
then when nature around me is smiling,
the last smile which answers to mine,
i do not believe it beguiling,
because it reminds me of thine
and when winds are at war with the ocean,
as the breasts i believed in with me,
if their billows excite an emotion,
it is that they bear me from thee
though the rock of my last hope is shivered,
and its fragments are sunk in the wave,
though i feel that my soul is delivered
to painit shall not be its slave
there is many a pang to pursue me
they may crush, but they shall not contemn
they may torture, but shall not subdue me
tis of thee that i thinknot of them
though human, thou didst not deceive me,
though woman, thou didst not forsake,
though loved, thou forborest to grieve me,
though slandered, thou never couldst shake,
though trusted, thou didst not disclaim me,
though parted, it was not to fly,
though watchful, twas not to defame me,
nor mute, that the world might belie
yet i blame not the world, nor despise it,
nor the war of the many with one
if my soul was not fitted to prize it,
twas folly not sooner to shun
and if dearly that error hath cost me,
and more than i once could foresee,
i have found that whatever it lost me,
it could not deprive me of thee
from the wreck of the past, which hath perished,
thus much i at least may recall,
it hath taught me that which i most cherished
deserved to be dearest of all
in the desert a fountain is springing,
in the wide waste there still is a tree,
and a bird in the solitude singing,
which speaks to my spirit of thee
although the rhythm here is one of the most difficult, the versification
could scarcely be improved no nobler theme ever engaged the pen of
poet it is the soulelevating idea that no man can consider himself
entitled to complain of fate while in his adversity he still retains the
unwavering love of woman
from alfred tennyson, although in perfect sincerity i regard him as the
noblest poet that ever lived, i have left myself time to cite only a
very brief specimen i call him, and think him the noblest of poets,
not because the impressions he produces are at all times the most
profoundnot because the poetical excitement which he induces is at
all times the most intensebut because it is at all times the most
etherealin other words, the most elevating and most pure no poet is
so little of the earth, earthy what i am about to read is from his last
long poem, the princess
tears, idle tears, i know not what they mean,
tears from the depth of some divine despair
rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,
in looking on the happy autumn fields,
and thinking of the days that are no more
fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,
that brings our friends up from the underworld,
sad as the last which reddens over one
that sinks with all we love below the verge
so sad, so fresh, the days that are no more
ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns
the earliest pipe of halfawakend birds
to dying ears, when unto dying eyes
the casement slowly grows a glimmering square
so sad, so strange, the days that are no more
dear as rememberd kisses after death,
and sweet as those by hopeless fancy feignd
on lips that are for others deep as love,
deep as first love, and wild with all regret
o death in life, the days that are no more
thus, although in a very cursory and imperfect manner, i have endeavored
to convey to you my conception of the poetic principle it has been my
purpose to suggest that, while this principle itself is strictly and
simply the human aspiration for supernal beauty, the manifestation of
the principle is always found in an elevating excitement of the soul,
quite independent of that passion which is the intoxication of the
heart, or of that truth which is the satisfaction of the reason for in
regard to passion, alas its tendency is to degrade rather than to
elevate the soul love, on the contrarylovethe true, the divine
erosthe uranian as distinguished from the dionasan venusis
unquestionably the purest and truest of all poetical themes and in
regard to truth, if, to be sure, through the attainment of a truth we
are led to perceive a harmony where none was apparent before, we
experience at once the true poetical effect but this effect is
referable to the harmony alone, and not in the least degree to the truth
which merely served to render the harmony manifest
we shall reach, however, more immediately a distinct conception of what
true poetry is, by mere reference to a few of the simple elements which
induce in the poet himself the true poetical effect he recognizes the
ambrosia which nourishes his soul in the bright orbs that shine in
heaven, in the volutes of the flower, in the clustering of low
shrubberies, in the waving of the grainfields, in the slanting of tall
eastern trees, in the blue distance of mountains, in the grouping of
clouds, in the twinkling of halfhidden brooks, in the gleaming of
silver rivers, in the repose of sequestered lakes, in the starmirroring
depths of lonely wells he perceives it in the songs of birds, in the
harp of olus, in the sighing of the nightwind, in the repining voice
of the forest, in the surf that complains to the shore, in the fresh
breath of the woods, in the scent of the violet, in the voluptuous
perfume of the hyacinth, in the suggestive odor that comes to him at
eventide from fardistant undiscovered islands, over dim oceans,
illimitable and unexplored he owns it in all noble thoughts, in all
unworldly motives, in all holy impulses, in all chivalrous, generous,
and selfsacrificing deeds he feels it in the beauty of woman, in the
grace of her step, in the lustre of her eye, in the melody of her voice,
in her soft laughter, in her sigh, in the harmony of the rustling of her
robes he deeply feels it in her winning endearments, in her burning
enthusiasms, in her gentle charities, in her meek and devotional
endurance, but above all, ah, far above all, he kneels to it, he
worships it in the faith, in the purity, in the strength, in the
altogether divine majesty of her love
let me conclude by the recitation of yet another brief poem, one very
different in character from any that i have before quoted it is by
motherwell, and is called the song of the cavalier with our modern
and altogether rational ideas of the absurdity and impiety of warfare,
we are not precisely in that frame of mind best adapted to sympathize
with the sentiments, and thus to appreciate the real excellence of the
poem to do this fully we must identify ourselves in fancy with the soul
of the old cavalier
a steed a steed of matchless speede
a sword of metal keene
al else to noble heartes is drosse
al else on earth is meane
the neighynge of the warhorse prowde
the rowleing of the drum,
the clangor of the trumpet lowde
be soundes from heaven that come
and oh the thundering presse of knightes,
when as their warcryes welle,
may tole from heaven an angel bright,
and rowse a fiend from hell,
then mounte then mounte, brave gallants all,
and don your helmes amaine,
deathes couriers, fame and honor, call
us to the field againe
no shrewish teares shall fill your eye
when the swordhilts in our hand,

our business is like men to fight,
and herolike to die

the philosophy of composition
charles dickens, in a note now lying before me, alluding to an
examination i once made of the mechanism of barnaby rudge, saysby
the way, are you aware that godwin wrote his caleb williams backwards?
he first involved his hero in a web of difficulties, forming the second
volume, and then, for the first, cast about him for some mode of
accounting for what had been done
i cannot think this the precise mode of procedure on the part of
godwinand indeed what he himself acknowledges is not altogether in
accordance with mr dickenss ideabut the author of caleb williams
was too good an artist not to perceive the advantage derivable from at
least a somewhat similar process nothing is more clear than that every
plot, worth the name, must be elaborated to its dnouement before
anything be attempted with the pen it is only with the dnouement
constantly in view that we can give a plot its indispensable air of
consequence, or causation, by making the incidents, and especially the
tone at all points, tend to the development of the intention
there is a radical error, i think, in the usual mode of constructing a
story either history affords a thesisor one is suggested by an
incident of the dayor, at best, the author sets himself to work in the
combination of striking events to form merely the basis of his
narrativedesigning, generally, to fill in with description, dialogue,
or autorial comment, whatever crevices of fact or action may, from page
to page, render themselves apparent
i prefer commencing with the consideration of an effect keeping
originality always in viewfor he is false to himself who ventures to
dispense with so obvious and so easily attainable a source of
interesti say to myself, in the first place, of the innumerable
effects or impressions of which the heart, the intellect, or more
generally the soul is susceptible, what one shall i, on the present
occasion, select? having chosen a novel first, and secondly, a vivid
effect, i consider whether it can be best wrought by incident or
tonewhether by ordinary incidents and peculiar tone, or the converse,
or by peculiarity both of incident and toneafterwards looking about me
or rather within for such combinations of events or tone as shall best
aid me in the construction of the effect
i have often thought how interesting a magazine paper might be written
by any author who wouldthat is to say, who coulddetail, step by
step, the processes by which any one of his compositions attained its
ultimate point of completion why such a paper has never been given to
the world, i am much at a loss to saybut perhaps the autorial vanity
has had more to do with the omission than any one other cause most
writerspoets in especialprefer having it understood that they
compose by a species of fine frenzyan ecstatic intuitionand would
positively shudder at letting the public take a peep behind the scenes,
at the elaborate and vacillating crudities of thoughtat the true
purposes seized only at the last momentat the innumerable glimpses of
idea that arrived not at the maturity of full viewat the fullymatured
fancies discarded in despair as unmanageableat the cautious selections
and rejectionsat the painful erasures and interpolations,in a word,
at the wheels and pinions, the tackle for sceneshifting, the
stepladders and demontraps, the cocks feathers, the red paint, and
the black patches, which, in ninetynine cases out of the hundred,
constitute the properties of the literary histrio
i am aware, on the other hand, that the case is by no means common, in
which an author is at all in condition to retrace the steps by which his
conclusions have been attained in general, suggestions, having arisen
pellmell, are pursued and forgotten in a similar manner
for my own part, i have neither sympathy with the repugnance alluded to,
nor, at any time, the least difficulty in recalling to mind the
progressive steps of any of my compositions and, since the interest of
an analysis, or reconstruction, such as i have considered a
desideratum, is quite independent of any real or fancied interest in
the thing analyzed, it will not be regarded as a breach of decorum on my
part to show the modus operandi by which some one of my own works was
put together i select the raven as most generally known it is my
design to render it manifest that no one point in its composition is
referrible either to accident or intuitionthat the work proceeded,
step by step, to its completion with the precision and rigid consequence
of a mathematical problem
let us dismiss, as irrelevant to the poem, per se, the
circumstanceor say the necessitywhich, in the first place, gave rise
to the intention of composing a poem that should suit at once the
popular and the critical taste
we commence, then, with this intention
the initial consideration was that of extent if any literary work is
too long to be read at one sitting, we must be content to dispense with
the immensely important effect derivable from unity of impressionfor,
if two sittings be required, the affairs of the world interfere, and
everything like totality is at once destroyed but since, ceteris
paribus, no poet can afford to dispense with anything that may
advance his design, it but remains to be seen whether there is, in
extent, any advantage to counterbalance the loss of unity which attends
it here i say no, at once what we term a long poem is, in fact, merely
a succession of brief onesthat is to say, of brief poetical effects
it is needless to demonstrate that a poem is such only inasmuch as it
intensely excites, by elevating the soul and all intense excitements
are, through a psychal necessity, brief for this reason, at least
onehalf of the paradise lost is essentially prosea succession of
poetical excitements interspersed, inevitably, with corresponding
depressionsthe whole being deprived, through the extremeness of its
length, of the vastly important artistic element, totality, or unity of
effect
it appears evident, then, that there is a distinct limit, as regards
length, to all works of literary artthe limit of a single sittingand
that, although in certain classes of prose composition, such as
robinson crusoe demanding no unity, this limit may be advantageously
overpassed, it can never properly be overpassed in a poem within this
limit, the extent of a poem may be made to bear mathematical relation to
its meritin other words, to the excitement or elevationagain, in
other words, to the degree of the true poetical effect which it is
capable of inducing for it is clear that the brevity must be in direct
ratio of the intensity of the intended effectthis, with one
provisothat a certain degree of duration is absolutely requisite for
the production of any effect at all
holding in view these considerations, as well as that degree of
excitement which i deemed not above the popular, while not below the
critical taste, i reached at once what i conceived the proper length
for my intended poema length of about one hundred lines it is, in
fact, a hundred and eight
my next thought concerned the choice of an impression, or effect, to be
conveyed and here i may as well observe that, throughout the
construction, i kept steadily in view the design of rendering the work
universally appreciable i should be carried too far out of my
immediate topic were i to demonstrate a point upon which i have
repeatedly insisted, and which, with the poetical, stands not in the
slightest need of demonstrationthe point, i mean, that beauty is the
sole legitimate province of the poem a few words, however, in
elucidation of my real meaning, which some of my friends have evinced a
disposition to misrepresent that pleasure which is at once the most
intense, the most elevating, and the most pure, is, i believe, found in
the contemplation of the beautiful when, indeed, men speak of beauty,
they mean, precisely, not a quality, as is supposed, but an effectthey
refer, in short, just to that intense and pure elevation of soul
not of intellect, or of heartupon which i have commented, and
which is experienced in consequence of contemplating the beautiful
now i designate beauty as the province of the poem, merely because it is
an obvious rule of art that effects should be made to spring from direct
causesthat objects should be attained through means best adapted for
their attainmentno one as yet having been weak enough to deny that the
peculiar elevation alluded to is most readily attained in the poem
now the object truth, or the satisfaction of the intellect, and the
object passion, or the excitement of the heart, are, although attainable
to a certain extent in poetry, far more readily attainable in prose
truth, in fact, demands a precision, and passion a homeliness the
truly passionate will comprehend me which are absolutely antagonistic
to that beauty which, i maintain, is the excitement, or pleasurable
elevation, of the soul it by no means follows from anything here said
that passion, or even truth, may not be introduced, and even profitably
introduced, into a poemfor they may serve in elucidation, or aid the
general effect, as do discords in music, by contrastbut the true
artist will always contrive, first, to tone them into proper
subservience to the predominant aim, and secondly, to enveil them, as
far as possible, in that beauty which is the atmosphere and the essence
of the poem
regarding, then, beauty as my province, my next question referred to the
tone of its highest manifestationand all experience has shown that
this tone is one of sadness beauty of whatever kind, in its supreme
development, invariably excites the sensitive soul to tears melancholy
is thus the most legitimate of all the poetical tones
the length, the province, and the tone being thus determined, i betook
myself to ordinary induction, with the view of obtaining some artistic
piquancy which might serve me as a keynote in the construction of the
poemsome pivot upon which the whole structure might turn in carefully
thinking over all the usual artistic effectsor more properly points,
in the theatrical sensei did not fail to perceive immediately that no
one had been so universally employed as that of the refrain the
universality of its employment sufficed to assure me of its intrinsic
value, and spared me the necessity of submitting it to analysis i
considered it, however, with regard to its susceptibility of
improvement, and soon saw it to be in a primitive condition as commonly
used, the refrain, or burden, not only is limited to lyric verse, but
depends for its impression upon the force of monotoneboth in sound and
thought the pleasure is deduced solely from the sense of identityof
repetition i resolved to diversify, and so heighten the effect, by
adhering in general to the monotone of sound, while i continually varied
that of thought that is to say, i determined to produce continuously
novel effects, by the variation of the application of the
refrainthe refrain itself remaining, for the most part, unvaried
these points being settled, i next bethought me of the nature of my
refrain since its application was to be repeatedly varied, it was
clear that the refrain itself must be brief, for there would have been
an insurmountable difficulty in frequent variations of application in
any sentence of length in proportion to the brevity of the sentence
would of course be the facility of the variation this led me at once to
a single word as the best refrain
the question now arose as to the character of the word having made up
my mind to a refrain, the division of the poem into stanzas was of
course a corollary, the refrain forming the close to each stanza that
such a close, to have force, must be sonorous and susceptible of
protracted emphasis, admitted no doubt, and these considerations
inevitably led me to the long o as the most sonorous vowel in
connection with r as the most producible consonant
the sound of the refrain being thus determined, it became necessary to
select a word embodying this sound, and at the same time in the fullest
possible keeping with that melancholy which i had predetermined as the
tone of the poem in such a search it would have been absolutely
impossible to overlook the word nevermore in fact, it was the very
first which presented itself
the next desideratum was a pretext for the continuous use of the one
word nevermore in observing the difficulty which i at once found in
inventing a sufficiently plausible reason for its continuous repetition,
i did not fail to perceive that this difficulty arose solely from the
preassumption that the word was to be so continuously or monotonously
spoken by a human beingi did not fail to perceive, in short, that
the difficulty lay in the reconciliation of this monotony with the
exercise of reason on the part of the creature repeating the word here,
then, immediately arose the idea of a nonreasoning creature capable
of speech and very naturally, a parrot, in the first instance,
suggested itself, but was superseded forthwith by a raven as equally
capable of speech, and infinitely more in keeping with the intended
tone
i had now gone so far as the conception of a raven, the bird of
illomen, monotonously repeating the one word nevermore at the
conclusion of each stanza in a poem of melancholy tone, and in length
about one hundred lines now, never losing sight of the object
supremeness or perfection at all points, i asked myselfof all
melancholy topics what, according to the universal understanding of
mankind, is the most melancholy? death, was the obvious reply and
when, i said, is this most melancholy of topics most poetical? from
what i have already explained at some length, the answer here also is
obviouswhen it most closely allies itself to beauty the death,
then, of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in
the world, and equally is it beyond doubt that the lips best suited for
such topic are those of a bereaved lover
i had now to combine the two ideas of a lover lamenting his deceased
mistress and a raven continuously repeating the word nevermore i had
to combine these, bearing in mind my design of varying at every turn the
application of the word repeated, but the only intelligible mode of
such combination is that of imagining the raven employing the word in
answer to the queries of the lover and here it was that i saw at once
the opportunity afforded for the effect on which i had been depending,
that is to say, the effect of the variation of application i saw that
i could make the first query propounded by the loverthe first query to
which the raven should reply nevermorethat i could make this first
query a commonplace one, the second less so, the third still less, and
so on, until at length the lover, startled from his original
nonchalance by the melancholy character of the word itself, by its
frequent repetition, and by a consideration of the ominous reputation of
the fowl that uttered it, is at length excited to superstition, and
wildly propounds queries of a far different characterqueries whose
solution he has passionately at heartpropounds them half in
superstition and half in that species of despair which delights in
selftorturepropounds them not altogether because he believes in the
prophetic or demoniac character of the bird which reason assures him is
merely repeating a lesson learned by rote, but because he experiences a
frenzied pleasure in so modelling his questions as to receive from the
expected nevermore the most delicious because the most intolerable
of sorrow perceiving the opportunity thus afforded me, or, more
strictly, thus forced upon me in the progress of the construction, i
first established in mind the climax or concluding querythat query to
which nevermore should be in the last place an answerthat query in
reply to which this word nevermore should involve the utmost
conceivable amount of sorrow and despair
here then the poem may be said to have its beginning, at the end where
all works of art should begin for it was here at this point of my
preconsiderations that i first put pen to paper in the composition of
the stanza
prophet, said i, thing of evil prophet still if bird or devil
by that heaven that bends above usby that god we both adore,
tell this soul with sorrow laden, if within the distant aidenn,
it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore
clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore
quoth the raven, nevermore
i composed this stanza, at this point, first that, by establishing the
climax, i might the better vary and graduate, as regards seriousness,
and importance the preceding queries of the lover, and secondly, that i
might definitely settle the rhythm, the metre, and the length and
general arrangement of the stanza, as well as graduate the stanzas which
were to precede, so that none of them might surpass this in rhythmical
effect had i been able in the subsequent composition to construct more
vigorous stanzas, i should without scruple have purposely enfeebled them
so as not to interfere with the climacteric effect
and here i may as well say a few words of the versification my first
object as usual was originality the extent to which this has been
neglected in versification is one of the most unaccountable things in
the world admitting that there is little possibility of variety in mere
rhythm, it is still clear that the possible varieties of metre and
stanza are absolutely infinite and yet, for centuries, no man, in
verse has ever done, or ever seemed to think of doing, an original
thing the fact is that originality unless in minds of very unusual
force is by no means a matter, as some suppose, of impulse or
intuition in general, to be found, it must be elaborately sought and,
although a positive merit of the highest class, demands in its
attainment less of invention than negation
of course i pretend to no originality in either the rhythm or metre of
the raven the former is trochaicthe latter is octametre
acatalectic, alternating with heptametre catalectic repeated in the
refrain of the fifth verse, and terminating with tetrametre
catalectic less pedantically, the feet employed throughout trochees
consists of a long syllable followed by a short the first line of the
stanza consists of eight of these feet, the second of seven and a half
in effect twothirds, the third of eight, the fourth of seven and a
half, the fifth the same, the sixth three and a half now, each of these
lines taken individually has been employed before, and what originality
the raven has, is in their combinations into stanzas nothing even
remotely approaching this combination has ever been attempted the
effect of this originality of combination is aided by other unusual and
some altogether novel effects, arising from an extension of the
application of the principles of rhyme and alliteration
the next point to be considered was the mode of bringing together the
lover and the ravenand the first branch of this consideration was the
locale for this the most natural suggestion might seem to be a
forest, or the fieldsbut it has always appeared to me that a close
circumscription of space is absolutely necessary to the effect of
insulated incidentit has the force of a frame to a picture it has an
indisputable moral power in keeping concentrated the attention, and, of
course, must not be confounded with mere unity of place
i determined, then, to place the lover in his chamberin a chamber
rendered sacred to him by memories of her who had frequented it the
room is represented as richly furnishedthis in mere pursuance of the
ideas i have already explained on the subject of beauty, as the sole
true poetical thesis
the locale being thus determined, i had now to introduce the birdand
the thought of introducing him through the window was inevitable the
idea of making the lover suppose, in the first instance, that the
flapping of the wings of the bird against the shutter, is a tapping at
the door, originated in a wish to increase, by prolonging, the readers
curiosity, and in a desire to admit the incidental effect arising from
the lovers throwing open the door, finding all dark, and thence
adopting the halffancy that it was the spirit of his mistress that
knocked
i made the night tempestuous, first to account for the ravens seeking
admission, and secondly, for the effect of contrast with the physical
serenity within the chamber
i made the bird alight on the bust of pallas, also for the effect of
contrast between the marble and the plumageit being understood that
the bust was absolutely suggested by the birdthe bust of pallas
being chosen, first, as most in keeping with the scholarship of the
lover, and, secondly, for the sonorousness of the word, pallas, itself
about the middle of the poem, also, i have availed myself of the force
of contrast, with a view of deepening the ultimate impression for
example, an air of the fantasticapproaching as nearly to the ludicrous
as was admissibleis given to the ravens entrance he comes in with
many a flirt and flutter
not the least obeisance made henot a moment stopped or stayed he,
but with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door
in the two stanzas which follow, the design is more obviously carried
out
then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling
by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou, i said, art sure no
craven,
ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore
tell me what thy lordly name is on the nights plutonian shore?
quoth the raven, nevermore
much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
though its answer little meaninglittle relevancy bore
for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door
bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
with such name as nevermore
the effect of the dnouement being thus provided for, i immediately drop
the fantastic for a tone of the most profound seriousnessthis tone
commencing in the stanza directly following the one last quoted, with
the line,
but the raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only, etc
from this epoch the lover no longer jestsno longer sees anything even
of the fantastic in the ravens demeanor he speaks of him as a grim,
ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore, and feels the
fiery eyes burning into his bosoms core this revolution of
thought, or fancy, on the lovers part, is intended to induce a similar
one on the part of the readerto bring the mind into a proper frame for
the dnouementwhich is now brought about as rapidly and as
directly as possible
with the dnouement properwith the ravens reply, nevermore, to
the lovers final demand if he shall meet his mistress in another
worldthe poem, in its obvious phase, that of a simple narrative, may
be said to have its completion so far, everything is within the limits
of the accountableof the real a raven having learned by rote the
single word nevermore, and having escaped from the custody of its
owner, is driven at midnight, through the violence of a storm, to seek
admission at a window from which a light still gleamsthe
chamberwindow of a student, occupied half in pouring over a volume,
half in dreaming of a beloved mistress deceased the casement being
thrown open at the fluttering of the birds wings, the bird itself
perches on the most convenient seat out of the immediate reach of the
student, who, amused by the incident and the oddity of the visitors
demeanor, demands of it, in jest and with out looking for a reply, its
name the raven addressed, answers with its customary word,
nevermorea word which finds immediate echo in the melancholy heart
of the student, who, giving utterance aloud to certain thoughts
suggested by the occasion, is again startled by the fowls repetition of
nevermore the student now guesses the state of the case, but is
impelled, as i have before explained, by the human thirst for
selftorture, and in part by superstition, to propound such queries to
the bird as will bring him, the lover, the most of the luxury of sorrow
through the anticipated answer nevermore with the indulgence, to the
extreme, of this selftorture, the narration, in what i have termed its
first or obvious phase, has a natural termination, and so far there has
been no overstepping of the limits of the real
but in subjects so handled, however skilfully, or with however vivid an
array of incident, there is always a certain hardness or nakedness which
repels the artistical eye two things are invariably requiredfirst,
some amount of complexity, or more properly, adaptation and, secondly,
some amount of suggestiveness, some undercurrent, however indefinite of
meaning it is this latter, in especial, which imparts to a work of art
so much of that richness to borrow from colloquy a forcible term
which we are too fond of confounding with the ideal it is the
excess of the suggested meaningit is the rendering this the upper
instead of the under current of themewhich turns into prose and that
of the very flattest kind the socalled poetry of the socalled
transcendentalists
holding these opinions, i added the two concluding stanzas of the
poemtheir suggestiveness being thus made to pervade all the narrative
which has preceded them the undercurrent of meaning is rendered first
apparent in the lines
take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door
quoth the raven, nevermore
it will be observed that the words, from out my heart, involve the
first metaphorical expression in the poem they, with the answer,
nevermore, dispose the mind to seek a moral in all that has been
previously narrated the reader begins now to regard the raven as
emblematicalbut it is not until the very last line of the very last
stanza, that the intention of making him emblematical of mournful and
neverending remembrance is permitted distinctly to be seen
and the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door
and his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming,
and the lamplight oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor
and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
shall be liftednevermore

old english poetry
it should not be doubted that at least onethird of the affection with
which we regard the elder poets of great britain should be attributed to
what is, in itself, a thing apart from poetrywe mean to the simple
love of the antiqueand that, again, a third of even the proper poetic
sentiment inspired by their writings, should be ascribed to a fact
which, while it has strict connection with poetry in the abstract, and
with the old british poems themselves, should not be looked upon as a
merit appertaining to the authors of the poems almost every devout
admirer of the old bards, if demanded his opinion of their productions,
would mention vaguely, yet with perfect sincerity, a sense of dreamy,
wild, indefinite, and he would perhaps say, indefinable delight on
being required to point out the source of this so shadowy pleasure, he
would be apt to speak of the quaint in phraseology and in general
handling this quaintness is, in fact, a very powerful adjunct to
ideality, but in the case in question it arises independently of the
authors will, and is altogether apart from his intention words and
their rhythm have varied verses which affect us today with a vivid
delight, and which delight, in many instances, may be traced to the one
source, quaintness, must have worn in the days of their construction a
very commonplace air this is, of course, no argument against the poems
nowwe mean it only as against the poets then there is a growing
desire to overrate them the old english muse was frank, guileless,
sincere and although very learned, still learned without art no general
error evinces a more thorough confusion of ideas than the error of
supposing donne and cowley metaphysical in the sense wherein wordsworth
and coleridge are so with the two former ethics were the endwith the
two latter the means the poet of the creation wished, by highly
artificial verse, to inculcate what he supposed to be moral truththe
poet of the ancient mariner to infuse the poetic sentiment through
channels suggested by analysis the one finished by complete failure
what he commenced in the grossest misconception the other, by a path
which could not possibly lead him astray, arrived at a triumph which is
not the less glorious because hidden from the profane eyes of the
multitude but in this view even the metaphysical verse of cowley is
but evidence of the simplicity and singleheartedness of the man and he
was in this but a type of his schoolfor we may as well designate in
this way the entire class of writers whose poems are bound up in the
volume before us, and throughout all of whom there runs a very
perceptible general character they used little art in composition
their writings sprang immediately from the souland partook intensely
of that souls nature nor is it difficult to perceive the tendency of
this abandonto elevate immeasurably all the energies of mindbut,
again, so to mingle the greatest possible fire, force, delicacy, and all
good things, with the lowest possible bathos, baldness, and imbecility,
as to render it not a matter of doubt that the average results of mind
in such a school will be found inferior to those results in one
ceteris paribus more artificial
we cannot bring ourselves to believe that the selections of the book of
gems are such as will impart to a poetical reader the clearest possible
idea of the beauty of the schoolbut if the intention had been merely
to show the schools character, the attempt might have been considered
successful in the highest degree there are long passages now before us
of the most despicable trash, with no merit whatever beyond that of
their antiquity the criticisms of the editor do not particularly please
us his enthusiasm is too general and too vivid not to be false his
opinion, for example, of sir henrys wottons verses on the queen of
bohemiathat there are few finer things in our language, is
untenable and absurd
in such lines we can perceive not one of those higher attributes of
poesy which belong to her in all circumstances and throughout all time
here everything is art, nakedly, or but awkwardly concealed no
prepossession for the mere antique and in this case we can imagine no
other prepossession should induce us to dignify with the sacred name of
poetry, a series, such as this, of elaborate and threadbare compliments,
stitched, apparently, together, without fancy, without plausibility, and
without even an attempt at adaptation
in common with all the world, we have been much delighted with the
shepherds hunting by withersa poem partaking, in a remarkable
degree, of the peculiarities of il penseroso speaking of poesy, the
author says
by the murmur of a spring,
or the least boughs rustleling,
by a daisy whose leaves spread,
shut when titan goes to bed,
or a shady bush or tree,
she could more infuse in me
than all natures beauties con
in some other wiser man
by her help i also now
make this churlish place allow
something that may sweeten gladness
in the very gall of sadness
the dull loneness, the black shade,
that these hanging vaults have made
the strange music of the waves
beating on these hollow caves,
this black den which rocks emboss,
overgrown with eldest moss,
the rude portals that give light
more to terror than delight,
this my chamber of neglect
walled about with disrespect
from all these and this dull air
a fit object for despair,
she hath taught me by her might
to draw comfort and delight
but these lines, however good, do not bear with them much of the general
character of the english antique something more of this will be found
in corbets farewell to the fairies we copy a portion of marvells
maiden lamenting for her fawn, which we prefernot only as a specimen
of the elder poets, but in itself as a beautiful poem, abounding in
pathos, exquisitely delicate imagination and truthfulnessto anything
of its species
it is a wondrous thing how fleet
twas on those little silver feet,
with what a pretty skipping grace
it oft would challenge me the race,
and whent had left me far away
twould stay, and run again, and stay
for it was nimbler much than hinds,
and trod as if on the four winds
i have a garden of my own,
but so with roses overgrown,
and lilies, that you would it guess
to be a little wilderness
and all the springtime of the year
it only loved to be there
among the beds of lilies i
have sought it oft where it should lie,
yet could not, till itself would rise,
find it, although before mine eyes
for in the flaxen lilies shade
it like a bank of lilies laid
upon the roses it would feed
until its lips even seemed to bleed,
and then to me twould boldly trip,
and print those roses on my lip,
but all its chief delight was still
with roses thus itself to fill,
and its pure virgin limbs to fold
in whitest sheets of lilies cold,
had it lived long, it would have been
lilies without, roses within
