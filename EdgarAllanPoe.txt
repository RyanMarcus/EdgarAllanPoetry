the raven
once upon a midnight dreary, while i pondered, weak and weary,
over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore--
while i nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
as of some one gently rapping--rapping at my chamber door
tis some visitor, i muttered, tapping at my chamber door--
only this and nothing more
ah, distinctly i remember, it was in the bleak december,
and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
eagerly i wished the morrow--vainly i had sought to borrow
from my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost lenore--
for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore--
nameless here for evermore
and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before
so that now, to still the beating of my heart, i stood repeating
tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door--
some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door--
this it is and nothing more
presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer,
sir, said i, or madam, truly your forgiveness i implore
but the fact is i was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
and so faintly you came tapping--tapping at my chamber door,
that i scarce was sure i heard you--here i opened wide the door--
darkness there and nothing more
deep into that darkness peering, long i stood there wondering,
fearing,
doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before
but the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,
and the only word there spoken was the whispered word, lenore
this i whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, lenore
merely this and nothing more
back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
soon i heard again a tapping, somewhat louder than before
surely, said i, surely that is something at my window lattice
let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore--
let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore--
tis the wind and nothing more
open here i flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore
not the least obeisance made he not an instant stopped or stayed he
but, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--
perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door--
perched, and sat, and nothing more
then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou, i said, art sure no
craven,
ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore--
tell me what thy lordly name is on the nights plutonian shore
quoth the raven, nevermore
much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore
for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--
bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
with such name as nevermore
but the raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only
that one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour
nothing further then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered--
till i scarcely more than muttered, other friends have flown before--
on the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before
then the bird said, nevermore
startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
doubtless, said i, what it utters is its only stock and store,
caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster
followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore--
till the dirges of his hope the melancholy burden bore
of never--nevermore
but the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and
door
then, upon the velvet sinking, i betook myself to linking
fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--
what this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
meant in croaking nevermore
this i sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms core
this and more i sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
on the cushions velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated oer,
but whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating oer,
she shall press, ah, nevermore
then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor
wretch, i cried, thy god hath lent thee--by these angels he hath
sent thee
respite--respite aad nepenth from thy memories of lenore
quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenth, and forget this lost lenore
quoth the raven, nevermore
prophet said i, thing of evil--prophet still, if bird or devil--
whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--
on this home by horror haunted--tell me truly, i implore--
is there--is there balm in gilead?--tell me--tell me, i implore
quoth the raven, nevermore
prophet said i, thing of evil--prophet still, if bird or devil
by that heaven that bends above us--by that god we both adore--
tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant aidenn,
it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore--
clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore
quoth the raven, nevermore
be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend i shrieked,
upstarting--
get thee back into the tempest and the nights plutonian shore
leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken
leave my loneliness unbroken--quit the bust above my door
take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door
quoth the raven, nevermore
and the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door
and his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming,
and the lamp-light oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor
and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
shall be lifted--nevermore

the bells,
i
hear the sledges with the bells--
silver bells
what a world of merriment their melody foretells
how they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,
in their icy air of night
while the stars, that oversprinkle
all the heavens, seem to twinkle
with a crystalline delight
keeping time, time, time,
in a sort of runic rhyme,
to the tintinnabulation that so musically wells
from the bells, bells, bells, bells,
bells, bells, bells--
from the jingling and the tinkling of the bells
ii
hear the mellow wedding bells,
golden bells
what a world of happiness their harmony foretells
through the balmy air of night
how they ring out their delight
from the molten golden-notes,
and all in tune,
what a liquid ditty floats
to the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats
on the moon
oh, from out the sounding cells,
what a gush of euphony voluminously wells
how it swells
how it dwells
on the future how it tells
of the rapture that impels
to the swinging and the ringing
of the bells, bells, bells,
of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
bells, bells, bells--
to the rhyming and the chiming of the bells
iii
hear the loud alarum bells--
brazen bells
what a tale of terror now their turbulency tells
in the startled ear of night
how they scream out their affright
too much horrified to speak,
they can only shriek, shriek,
out of tune,
in a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,
in a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire
leaping higher, higher, higher,
with a desperate desire,
and a resolute endeavor
now--now to sit or never,
by the side of the pale-faced moon
oh, the bells, bells, bells
what a tale their terror tells
of despair
how they clang, and clash, and roar
what a horror they outpour
on the bosom of the palpitating air
yet the ear it fully knows,
by the twanging,
and the clanging,
how the danger ebbs and flows
yet the ear distinctly tells,
in the jangling,
and the wrangling,
how the danger sinks and swells,
by the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells--
of the bells--
of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
bells, bells, bells--
in the clamor and the clangor of the bells
iv
hear the tolling of the bells--
iron bells
what a world of solemn thought their monody compels
in the silence of the night,
how we shiver with affright
at the melancholy menace of their tone
for every sound that floats
from the rust within their throats
is a groan
and the people--ah, the people--
they that dwell up in the steeple
all alone,
and who toiling, toiling, toiling,
in that muffled monotone,
feel a glory in so rolling
on the human heart a stone--
they are neither man nor woman--
they are neither brute nor human--
they are ghouls
and their king it is who tolls
and he rolls, rolls, rolls,
rolls
a pan from the bells
and his merry bosom swells
with the pan of the bells
and he dances, and he yells
keeping time, time, time,
in a sort of runic rhyme,
to the pan of the bells--
of the bells
keeping time, time, time,
in a sort of runic rhyme,
to the throbbing of the bells--
of the bells, bells, bells--
to the sobbing of the bells
keeping time, time, time,
as he knells, knells, knells,
in a happy runic rhyme,
to the rolling of the bells--
of the bells, bells, bells--
to the tolling of the bells,
of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
bells, bells, bells--
to the moaning and the groaning of the bells


ulalume
the skies they were ashen and sober
the leaves they were crisped and sere--
the leaves they were withering and sere
it was night in the lonesome october
of my most immemorial year
it was hard by the dim lake of auber,
in the misty mid region of weir--
it was down by the dank tarn of auber,
in the ghoul-haunted woodland of weir
here once, through an alley titanic
of cypress, i roamed with my soul--
of cypress, with psyche, my soul
these were days when my heart was volcanic
as the scoriac rivers that roll--
as the lavas that restlessly roll
their sulphurous currents down yaanek
in the ultimate climes of the pole--
that groan as they roll down mount yaanek
in the realms of the boreal pole
our talk had been serious and sober,
but our thoughts they were palsied and sere--
our memories were treacherous and sere--
for we knew not the month was october,
and we marked not the night of the year--
ah, night of all nights in the year
we noted not the dim lake of auber--
though once we had journeyed down here--
remembered not the dank tarn of auber,
nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of weir
and now as the night was senescent
and star-dials pointed to morn--
as the sun-dials hinted of morn--
at the end of our path a liquescent
and nebulous lustre was born,
out of which a miraculous crescent
arose with a duplicate horn--
astartes bediamonded crescent
distinct with its duplicate horn
and i said--she is warmer than dian
she rolls through an ether of sighs--
she revels in a region of sighs
she has seen that the tears are not dry on
these cheeks, where the worm never dies,
and has come past the stars of the lion
to point us the path to the skies--
to the lethean peace of the skies--
come up, in despite of the lion,
to shine on us with her bright eyes--
come up through the lair of the lion,
with love in her luminous eyes
but psyche, uplifting her finger,
said--sadly this star i mistrust--
her pallor i strangely mistrust--
oh, hasten--oh, let us not linger
oh, fly--let us fly--for we must
in terror she spoke, letting sink her
wings till they trailed in the dust--
in agony sobbed, letting sink her
plumes till they trailed in the dust--
till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust
i replied--this is nothing but dreaming
let us on by this tremulous light
let us bathe in this crystalline light
its sibyllic splendor is beaming
with hope and in beauty to-night--
see--it flickers up the sky through the night
ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,
and be sure it will lead us aright--
we safely may trust to a gleaming
that cannot but guide us aright,
since it flickers up to heaven through the night
thus i pacified psyche and kissed her,
and tempted her out of her gloom--
and conquered her scruples and gloom
and we passed to the end of a vista,
but were stopped by the door of a tomb--
by the door of a legended tomb
and i said--what is written, sweet sister,
on the door of this legended tomb?
she replied--ulalume--ulalume--
tis the vault of thy lost ulalume
then my heart it grew ashen and sober
as the leaves that were crisped and sere--
as the leaves that were withering and sere
and i cried--it was surely october
on this very night of last year
that i journeyed--i journeyed down here--
that i brought a dread burden down here
on this night of all nights in the year,
ah, what demon has tempted me here?
well i know, now, this dim lake of auber--
this misty mid region of weir--
well i know, now, this dank tarn of auber,--
this ghoul-haunted woodland of weir


to helen
i saw thee once--once only--years ago
i must not say how many--but not many
it was a july midnight and from out
a full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring,
sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,
there fell a silvery-silken veil of light,
with quietude, and sultriness and slumber,
upon the upturnd faces of a thousand
roses that grew in an enchanted garden,
where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe--
fell on the upturnd faces of these roses
that gave out, in return for the love-light,
their odorous souls in an ecstatic death--
fell on the upturnd faces of these roses
that smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted
by thee, and by the poetry of thy presence
clad all in white, upon a violet bank
i saw thee half-reclining while the moon
fell on the upturnd faces of the roses,
and on thine own, upturnd--alas, in sorrow
was it not fate, that, on this july midnight--
was it not fate whose name is also sorrow,
that bade me pause before that garden-gate,
to breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?
no footstep stirred the hated world all slept,
save only thee and me--o heaven--o god
how my heart beats in coupling those two words--
save only thee and me i paused--i looked--
and in an instant all things disappeared
ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted
the pearly lustre of the moon went out
the mossy banks and the meandering paths,
the happy flowers and the repining trees,
were seen no more the very roses odors
died in the arms of the adoring airs
all--all expired save thee--save less than thou
save only the divine light in thine eyes--
save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes
i saw but them--they were the world to me
i saw but them--saw only them for hours--
saw only them until the moon went down
what wild heart-histories seemed to lie unwritten
upon those crystalline, celestial spheres
how dark a woe yet how sublime a hope
how silently serene a sea of pride
how daring an ambition yet how deep--
how fathomless a capacity for love
but now, at length, dear dian sank from sight,
into a western couch of thunder-cloud
and thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees
didst glide away only thine eyes remained
they would not go--they never yet have gone
lighting my lonely pathway home that night,
they have not left me as my hopes have since
they follow me--they lead me through the years
they are my ministers--yet i their slave
their office is to illumine and enkindle--
my duty, to be saved by their bright light,
and purified in their electric fire,
and sanctified in their elysian fire
they fill my soul with beauty which is hope,
and are far up in heaven--the stars i kneel to
in the sad, silent watches of my night
while even in the meridian glare of day
i see them still--two sweetly scintillant
venuses, unextinguished by the sun


annabel lee
it was many and many a year ago,
in a kingdom by the sea,
that a maiden there lived whom you may know
by the name of annabel lee
and this maiden she lived with no other thought
than to love and be loved by me
i was a child and she was a child,
in this kingdom by the sea
but we loved with a love that was more than love--
i and my annabel lee
with a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
coveted her and me
and this was the reason that, long ago,
in this kingdom by the sea,
a wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
my beautiful annabel lee
so that her highborn kinsmen came
and bore her away from me,
to shut her up in a sepulchre
in this kingdom by the sea
the angels, not half so happy in heaven,
went envying her and me--
yes--that was the reason as all men know,
in this kingdom by the sea
that the wind came out of the cloud by night,
chilling and killing my annabel lee
but our love it was stronger by far than the love
of those who were older than we--
of many far wiser than we--
and neither the angels in heaven above,
nor the demons down under the sea,
can ever dissever my soul from the soul
of the beautiful annabel lee
for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
of the beautiful annabel lee
and the stars never rise but i see the bright eyes
of the beautiful annabel lee
and so, all the night-tide, i lie down by the side
of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride,
in her sepulchre there by the sea--
in her tomb by the side of the sea

a valentine
for her this rhyme is penned, whose luminous eyes,
brightly expressive as the twins of leda,
shall find her own sweet name, that, nestling lies
upon the page, enwrapped from every reader
search narrowly the lines--they hold a treasure
divine--a talisman--an amulet
that must be worn at heart search well the measure--
the words--the syllables do not forget
the trivialest point, or you may lose your labor
and yet there is in this no gordian knot
which one might not undo without a sabre,
if one could merely comprehend the plot
enwritten upon the leaf where now are peering
eyes scintillating soul, there lie perdus
three eloquent words oft uttered in the hearing
of poets by poets--as the name is a poets, too
its letters, although naturally lying
like the knight pinto--mendez ferdinando--
still form a synonym for truth--cease trying
you will not read the riddle, though you do the best you can do

to discover the names in this and the following poem, read the first
letter of the first line in connection with the second letter of the
second line, the third letter of the third line, the fourth, of the
fourth and so on, to the end

an enigma
seldom we find, says solomon don dunce,
half an idea in the profoundest sonnet
through all the flimsy things we see at once
as easily as through a naples bonnet--
trash of all trash--how can a lady don it?
yet heavier far than your petrarchan stuff--
owl-downy nonsense that the faintest puff
twirls into trunk-paper the while you con it
and, veritably, sol is right enough
the general tuckermanities are arrant
bubbles--ephemeral and so transparent--
but this is, now--you may depend upon it--
stable, opaque, immortal--all by dint
of the dear names that lie concealed withint


to my mother
because i feel that, in the heavens above,
the angels, whispering to one another,
can find, among their burning terms of love,
none so devotional as that of mother,
therefore by that dear name i long have called you--
you who are more than mother unto me,
and fill my heart of hearts, where death installed you,
in setting my virginias spirit free
my mother--my own mother, who died early,
was but the mother of myself but you
are mother to the one i loved so dearly,
and thus are dearer than the mother i knew
by that infinity with which my wife
was dearer to my soul than its soul-life

the above was addressed to the poets mother-in-law, mrs clemm--ed

for annie
thank heaven the crisis--
the danger is past,
and the lingering illness
is over at last--
and the fever called living
is conquered at last
sadly, i know,
i am shorn of my strength,
and no muscle i move
as i lie at full length--
but no matter--i feel
i am better at length
and i rest so composedly,
now in my bed,
that any beholder
might fancy me dead--
might start at beholding me
thinking me dead
the moaning and groaning,
the sighing and sobbing,
are quieted now,
with that horrible throbbing
at heart--ah, that horrible,
horrible throbbing
the sickness--the nausea--
the pitiless pain--
have ceased, with the fever
that maddened my brain--
with the fever called living
that burned in my brain
and oh of all tortures
that torture the worst
has abated--the terrible
torture of thirst,
for the naphthaline river
of passion accurst--
i have drank of a water
that quenches all thirst--
of a water that flows,
with a lullaby sound,
from a spring but a very few
feet under ground--
from a cavern not very far
down under ground
and ah let it never
be foolishly said
that my room it is gloomy
and narrow my bed--
for man never slept
in a different bed
and, to sleep, you must slumber
in just such a bed
my tantalized spirit
here blandly reposes,
forgetting, or never
regretting its roses--
its old agitations
of myrtles and roses
for now, while so quietly
lying, it fancies
a holier odor
about it, of pansies--
a rosemary odor,
commingled with pansies--
with rue and the beautiful
puritan pansies
and so it lies happily,
bathing in many
a dream of the truth
and the beauty of annie--
drowned in a bath
of the tresses of annie
she tenderly kissed me,
she fondly caressed,
and then i fell gently
to sleep on her breast--
deeply to sleep
from the heaven of her breast
when the light was extinguished,
she covered me warm,
and she prayed to the angels
to keep me from harm--
to the queen of the angels
to shield me from harm
and i lie so composedly,
now in my bed
knowing her love
that you fancy me dead--
and i rest so contentedly,
now in my bed,
with her love at my breast
that you fancy me dead--
that you shudder to look at me
thinking me dead
but my heart it is brighter
than all of the many
stars in the sky,
for it sparkles with annie--
it glows with the light
of the love of my annie--
with the thought of the light
of the eyes of my annie


to f--
beloved amid the earnest woes
that crowd around my earthly path--
drear path, alas where grows
not even one lonely rose--
my soul at least a solace hath
in dreams of thee, and therein knows
an eden of bland repose
and thus thy memory is to me
like some enchanted far-off isle
in some tumultuous sea--
some ocean throbbing far and free
with storm--but where meanwhile
serenest skies continually
just oer that one bright inland smile


to frances s osgood
thou wouldst be loved?--then let thy heart
from its present pathway part not
being everything which now thou art,
be nothing which thou art not
so with the world thy gentle ways,
thy grace, thy more than beauty,
shall be an endless theme of praise
and love a simple duty


eldorado
gaily bedight,
a gallant knight,
in sunshine and in shadow,
had journeyed long,
singing a song,
in search of eldorado
but he grew old--
this knight so bold--
and oer his heart a shadow
fell as he found
no spot of ground
that looked like eldorado
and, as his strength
failed him at length,
he met a pilgrim shadow--
shadow, said he,
where can it be--
this land of eldorado?
over the mountains
of the moon,
down the valley of the shadow,
ride, boldly ride,
the shade replied,
if you seek for eldorado


eulalie
i dwelt alone
in a world of moan,
and my soul was a stagnant tide,
till the fair and gentle eulalie became my blushing bride--
till the yellow-haired young eulalie became my smiling bride
ah, less--less bright
the stars of the night
than the eyes of the radiant girl
and never a flake
that the vapor can make
with the moon-tints of purple and pearl,
can vie with the modest eulalies most unregarded curl--
can compare with the bright-eyed eulalies most humble and careless
curl
now doubt--now pain
come never again,
for her soul gives me sigh for sigh,
and all day long
shines, bright and strong,
astart within the sky,
while ever to her dear eulalie upturns her matron eye--
while ever to her young eulalie upturns her violet eye


a dream within a dream
take this kiss upon the brow
and, in parting from you now,
thus much let me avow--
you are not wrong, who deem
that my days have been a dream
yet if hope has flown away
in a night, or in a day,
in a vision or in none,
is it therefore the less gone?
all that we see or seem
is but a dream within a dream
i stand amid the roar
of a surf-tormented shore,
and i hold within my hand
grains of the golden sand--
how few yet how they creep
through my fingers to the deep
while i weep--while i weep
o god can i not grasp
them with a tighter clasp?
o god can i not save
one from the pitiless wave?
is all that we see or seem
but a dream within a dream?


to marie louise shew
of all who hail thy presence as the morning--
of all to whom thine absence is the night--
the blotting utterly from out high heaven
the sacred sun--of all who, weeping, bless thee
hourly for hope--for life--ah, above all,
for the resurrection of deep buried faith
in truth, in virtue, in humanity--
of all who, on despairs unhallowed bed
lying down to die, have suddenly arisen
at thy soft-murmured words, let there be light
at thy soft-murmured words that were fulfilled
in thy seraphic glancing of thine eyes--
of all who owe thee most, whose gratitude
nearest resembles worship,--oh, remember
the truest, the most fervently devoted,
and think that these weak lines are written by him--
by him who, as he pens them, thrills to think
his spirit is communing with an angels


to marie louise shew
not long ago, the writer of these lines,
in the mad pride of intellectuality,
maintained the power of words--denied that ever
a thought arose within the human brain
beyond the utterance of the human tongue
and now, as if in mockery of that boast,
two words--two foreign soft dissyllables--
italian tones, made only to be murmured
by angels dreaming in the moonlit dew
that hangs like chains of pearl on hermon hill,--
have stirred from out the abysses of his heart,
unthought-like thoughts that are the souls of thought,
richer, far wilder, far diviner visions
than even the seraph harper, israfel,
who has the sweetest voice of all gods creatures,
could hope to utter and i my spells are broken
the pen falls powerless from my shivering hand
with thy dear name as text, though hidden by thee,
i cannot write--i cannot speak or think--
alas, i cannot feel for tis not feeling,
this standing motionless upon the golden
threshold of the wide-open gate of dreams,
gazing, entranced, adown the gorgeous vista,
and thrilling as i see, upon the right,
upon the left, and all the way along,
amid empurpled vapors, far away
to where the prospect terminates--thee only

the city in the sea
lo death has reared himself a throne
in a strange city lying alone
far down within the dim west,
where the good and the bad and the worst and the best
have gone to their eternal rest
there shrines and palaces and towers
time-eaten towers and tremble not
resemble nothing that is ours
around, by lifting winds forgot,
resignedly beneath the sky
the melancholy waters lie
no rays from the holy heaven come down
on the long night-time of that town
but light from out the lurid sea
streams up the turrets silently--
gleams up the pinnacles far and free--
up domes--up spires--up kingly halls--
up fanes--up babylon-like walls--
up shadowy long-forgotten bowers
of sculptured ivy and stone flowers--
up many and many a marvellous shrine
whose wreathed friezes intertwine
the viol, the violet, and the vine
resignedly beneath the sky
the melancholy waters lie
so blend the turrets and shadows there
that all seem pendulous in air,
while from a proud tower in the town
death looks gigantically down
there open fanes and gaping graves
yawn level with the luminous waves
but not the riches there that lie
in each idols diamond eye--
not the gaily-jewelled dead
tempt the waters from their bed
for no ripples curl, alas
along that wilderness of glass--
no swellings tell that winds may be
upon some far-off happier sea--
no heavings hint that winds have been
on seas less hideously serene
but lo, a stir is in the air
the wave--there is a movement there
as if the towers had thrust aside,
in slightly sinking, the dull tide--
as if their tops had feebly given
a void within the filmy heaven
the waves have now a redder glow--
the hours are breathing faint and low--
and when, amid no earthly moans,
down, down that town shall settle hence,
hell, rising from a thousand thrones,
shall do it reverence
?

the sleeper
at midnight, in the month of june,
i stand beneath the mystic moon
an opiate vapor, dewy, dim,
exhales from out her golden rim,
and, softly dripping, drop by drop,
upon the quiet mountain top,
steals drowsily and musically
into the universal valley
the rosemary nods upon the grave
the lily lolls upon the wave
wrapping the fog about its breast,
the ruin moulders into rest
looking like lethe, see the lake
a conscious slumber seems to take,
and would not, for the world, awake
all beauty sleeps--and lo where lies
her casement open to the skies
irene, with her destinies
oh, lady bright can it be right--
this window open to the night
the wanton airs, from the tree-top,
laughingly through the lattice-drop--
the bodiless airs, a wizard rout,
flit through thy chamber in and out,
and wave the curtain canopy
so fitfully--so fearfully--
above the closed and fringed lid
neath which thy slumbring soul lies hid,
that, oer the floor and down the wall,
like ghosts the shadows rise and fall
oh, lady dear, hast thou no fear?
why and what art thou dreaming here?
sure thou art come oer far-off seas,
a wonder to these garden trees
strange is thy pallor strange thy dress
strange, above all, thy length of tress,
and this all-solemn silentness
the lady sleeps oh, may her sleep
which is enduring, so be deep
heaven have her in its sacred keep
this chamber changed for one more holy,
this bed for one more melancholy,
i pray to god that she may lie
for ever with unopened eye,
while the dim sheeted ghosts go by
my love, she sleeps oh, may her sleep,
as it is lasting, so be deep
soft may the worms about her creep
far in the forest, dim and old,
for her may some tall vault unfold--
some vault that oft hath flung its black
and winged panels fluttering back,
triumphant, oer the crested palls,
of her grand family funerals--
some sepulchre, remote, alone,
against whose portal she hath thrown,
in childhood many an idle stone--
some tomb from out whose sounding door
she neer shall force an echo more,
thrilling to think, poor child of sin
it was the dead who groaned within


bridal ballad
the ring is on my hand,
and the wreath is on my brow
satins and jewels grand
are all at my command
and i am happy now
and my lord he loves me well
but, when first he breathed his vow,
i felt my bosom swell--
for the words rang as a knell,
and the voice seemed his who fell
in the battle down the dell,
and who is happy now
but he spoke to reassure me,
and he kissed my pallid brow,
while a reverie came oer me,
and to the churchyard bore me,
and i sighed to him before me,
thinking him dead delormie,
oh, i am happy now
and thus the words were spoken,
and thus the plighted vow,
and, though my faith be broken,
and, though my heart be broken,
behold the golden keys
that proves me happy now
would to god i could awaken
for i dream i know not how,
and my soul is sorely shaken
lest an evil step be taken,--
lest the dead who is forsaken
may not be happy now


the bells--ah the bells
the little silver bells
how fairy-like a melody there floats
from their throats--
from their merry little throats--
from the silver, tinkling throats
of the bells, bells, bells--
of the bells
ii
the bells--ah, the bells
the heavy iron bells
how horrible a monody there floats
from their throats--
from their deep-toned throats--
from their melancholy throats
how i shudder at the notes
of the bells, bells, bells--
of the bells

poems of manhood

lenore
ah, broken is the golden bowl the spirit flown forever
let the bell toll--a saintly soul floats on the stygian river
and, guy de vere, hast thou no tear?--weep now or never more
see on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, lenore
come let the burial rite be read--the funeral song be sung--
an anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young--
a dirge for her, the doubly dead in that she died so young
wretches ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride,
and when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed her--that she died
how shall the ritual, then, be read?--the requiem how be sung
by you--by yours, the evil eye,--by yours, the slanderous tongue
that did to death the innocence that died, and died so young?
peccavimus but rave not thus and let a sabbath song
go up to god so solemnly the dead may feel no wrong
the sweet lenore hath gone before, with hope, that flew beside,
leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy bride--
for her, the fair and dbonnaire, that now so lowly lies,
the life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes--
the life still there, upon her hair--the death upon her eyes
avaunt to-night my heart is light no dirge will i upraise,
but waft the angel on her flight with a pan of old days
let no bell toll--lest her sweet soul, amid its hallowed mirth,
should catch the note, as it doth float up from the damned earth
to friends above, from fiends below, the indignant ghost is riven--
from hell unto a high estate far up within the heaven--
from grief and groan to a golden throne beside the king of heaven


to one in paradise,
thou wast that all to me, love,
for which my soul did pine--
a green isle in the sea, love,
a fountain and a shrine,
all wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers,
and all the flowers were mine
ah, dream too bright to last
ah, starry hope that didst arise
but to be overcast
a voice from out the future cries,
on on--but oer the past
dim gulf my spirit hovering lies
mute, motionless, aghast
for, alas alas with me
the light of life is oer
no more--no more--no more--
such language holds the solemn sea
to the sands upon the shore
shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,
or the stricken eagle soar
and all my days are trances,
and all my nightly dreams
are where thy dark eye glances,
and where thy footstep gleams--
in what ethereal dances,
by what eternal streams
alas for that accursed time
they bore thee oer the billow,
from love to titled age and crime,
and an unholy pillow
from me, and from our misty clime,
where weeps the silver willow


the coliseum
type of the antique rome rich reliquary
of lofty contemplation left to time
by buried centuries of pomp and power
at length--at length--after so many days
of weary pilgrimage and burning thirst,
thirst for the springs of lore that in thee lie,
i kneel, an altered and an humble man,
amid thy shadows, and so drink within
my very soul thy grandeur, gloom, and glory
vastness and age and memories of eld
silence and desolation and dim night
i feel ye now--i feel ye in your strength--
o spells more sure than eer judan king
taught in the gardens of gethsemane
o charms more potent than the rapt chaldee
ever drew down from out the quiet stars
here, where a hero fell, a column falls
here, where the mimic eagle glared in gold,
a midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat
here, where the dames of rome their gilded hair
waved to the wind, now wave the reed and thistle
here, where on golden throne the monarch lolled,
glides, spectre-like, unto his marble home,
lit by the wan light of the horned moon,
the swift and silent lizard of the stones
but stay these walls--these ivy-clad arcades--
these mouldering plinths--these sad and blackened shafts--
these vague entablatures--this crumbling frieze--
these shattered cornices--this wreck--this ruin--
these stones--alas these gray stones--are they all--
all of the famed, and the colossal left
by the corrosive hours to fate and me?
not all--the echoes answer me--not all
prophetic sounds and loud, arise forever
from us, and from all ruin, unto the wise,
as melody from memnon to the sun
we rule the hearts of mightiest men--we rule
with a despotic sway all giant minds
we are not impotent--we pallid stones
not all our power is gone--not all our fame--
not all the magic of our high renown--
not all the wonder that encircles us--
not all the mysteries that in us lie--
not all the memories that hang upon
and cling around about us as a garment,
clothing us in a robe of more than glory


the haunted palace
in the greenest of our valleys
by good angels tenanted,
once a fair and stately palace--
radiant palace--reared its head
in the monarch thoughts dominion--
it stood there
never seraph spread a pinion
over fabric half so fair
banners yellow, glorious, golden,
on its roof did float and flow,
this--all this--was in the olden
time long ago,
and every gentle air that dallied,
in that sweet day,
along the ramparts plumed and pallid,
a winged odor went away
wanderers in that happy valley,
through two luminous windows, saw
spirits moving musically,
to a lutes well-tund law,
bound about a throne where, sitting
porphyrogene
in state his glory well befitting,
the ruler of the realm was seen
and all with pearl and ruby glowing
was the fair palace door,
through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,
and sparkling evermore,
a troop of echoes, whose sweet duty
was but to sing,
in voices of surpassing beauty,
the wit and wisdom of their king
but evil things, in robes of sorrow,
assailed the monarchs high estate
ah, let us mourn--for never morrow
shall dawn upon him desolate
and round about his home the glory
that blushed and bloomed,
is but a dim-remembered story
of the old time entombed
and travellers, now, within that valley,
through the red-litten windows see
vast forms, that move fantastically
to a discordant melody,
while, like a ghastly rapid river,
through the pale door
a hideous throng rush out forever
and laugh--but smile no more


the conqueror worm
lo tis a gala night
within the lonesome latter years
an angel throng, bewinged, bedight
in veils, and drowned in tears,
sit in a theatre, to see
a play of hopes and fears,
while the orchestra breathes fitfully
the music of the spheres
mimes, in the form of god on high,
mutter and mumble low,
and hither and thither fly--
mere puppets they, who come and go
at bidding of vast formless things
that shift the scenery to and fro,
flapping from out their condor wings
invisible wo
that motley drama--oh, be sure
it shall not be forgot
with its phantom chased for evermore,
by a crowd that seize it not,
through a circle that ever returneth in
to the self-same spot,
and much of madness, and more of sin,
and horror the soul of the plot
but see, amid the mimic rout
a crawling shape intrude
a blood-red thing that writhes from out
the scenic solitude
it writhes--it writhes--with mortal pangs
the mimes become its food,
and the angels sob at vermin fangs
in human gore imbued
out--out are the lights--out all
and, over each quivering form,
the curtain, a funeral pall,
comes down with the rush of a storm,
and the angels, all pallid and wan,
uprising, unveiling, affirm
that the play is the tragedy, man,
and its hero the conqueror worm


silence
there are some qualities--some incorporate things,
that have a double life, which thus is made
a type of that twin entity which springs
from matter and light, evinced in solid and shade
there is a twofold silence--sea and shore--
body and soul one dwells in lonely places,
newly with grass oergrown some solemn graces,
some human memories and tearful lore,
render him terrorless his names no more
he is the corporate silence dread him not
no power hath he of evil in himself
but should some urgent fate untimely lot
bring thee to meet his shadow nameless elf,
that haunteth the lone regions where hath trod
no foot of man, commend thyself to god


dreamland
by a route obscure and lonely,
haunted by ill angels only,
where an eidolon, named night,
on a black throne reigns upright,
i have reached these lands but newly
from an ultimate dim thule--
from a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime,
out of space--out of time
bottomless vales and boundless floods,
and chasms, and caves, and titan woods,
with forms that no man can discover
for the dews that drip all over
mountains toppling evermore
into seas without a shore
seas that restlessly aspire,
surging, unto skies of fire
lakes that endlessly outspread
their lone waters--lone and dead,
their still waters--still and chilly
with the snows of the lolling lily
by the lakes that thus outspread
their lone waters, lone and dead,--
their sad waters, sad and chilly
with the snows of the lolling lily,--
by the mountains--near the river
murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,--
by the gray woods,--by the swamp
where the toad and the newt encamp,--
by the dismal tarns and pools
where dwell the ghouls,--
by each spot the most unholy--
in each nook most melancholy,--
there the traveller meets aghast
sheeted memories of the past--
shrouded forms that start and sigh
as they pass the wanderer by--
white-robed forms of friends long given,
in agony, to the earth--and heaven
for the heart whose woes are legion
tis a peaceful, soothing region--
for the spirit that walks in shadow
tis--oh, tis an eldorado
but the traveller, travelling through it,
may not--dare not openly view it
never its mysteries are exposed
to the weak human eye unclosed
so wills its king, who hath forbid
the uplifting of the fringed lid
and thus the sad soul that here passes
beholds it but through darkened glasses
by a route obscure and lonely,
haunted by ill angels only
where an eidolon, named night,
on a black throne reigns upright,
i have wandered home but newly
from this ultimate dim thule


to zante
fair isle, that from the fairest of all flowers,
thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take
how many memories of what radiant hours
at sight of thee and thine at once awake
how many scenes of what departed bliss
how many thoughts of what entombed hopes
how many visions of a maiden that is
no more--no more upon thy verdant slopes
no more alas, that magical sad sound
transforming all thy charms shall please no more--
thy memory no more accursed ground
henceforward i hold thy flower-enamelled shore,
o hyacinthine isle o purple zante
isola doro fior di levante


hymn
at morn--at noon--at twilight dim--
maria thou hast heard my hymn
in joy and wo--in good and ill--
mother of god, be with me still
when the hours flew brightly by,
and not a cloud obscured the sky,
my soul, lest it should truant be,
thy grace did guide to thine and thee
now, when storms of fate oercast
darkly my present and my past,
let my future radiant shine
with sweet hopes of thee and thine

i
rome--a hall in a palace alessandra and castiglione
alessandra     thou art sad, castiglione
castiglione    sad--not i
oh, im the happiest, happiest man in rome
a few days more, thou knowest, my alessandra,
will make thee mine oh, i am very happy
aless          methinks thou hast a singular way of showing
thy happiness--what ails thee, cousin of mine?
why didst thou sigh so deeply?
cas            did i sigh?
i was not conscious of it it is a fashion,
a silly--a most silly fashion i have
when i am very happy did i sigh? sighing
aless          thou didst thou art not well thou hast indulged
too much of late, and i am vexed to see it
late hours and wine, castiglione,--these
will ruin thee thou art already altered--
thy looks are haggard--nothing so wears away
the constitution as late hours and wine
cas musing  nothing, fair cousin, nothing--
not even deep sorrow--
wears it away like evil hours and wine
i will amend
aless          do it i would have thee drop
thy riotous company, too--fellows low born
ill suit the like of old di broglios heir
and alessandras husband
cas            i will drop them
aless          thou wilt--thou must attend thou also more
to thy dress and equipage--they are over plain
for thy lofty rank and fashion--much depends
upon appearances
cas            ill see to it
aless          then see to it--pay more attention, sir,
to a becoming carriage--much thou wantest
in dignity
cas            much, much, oh, much i want
in proper dignity
aless
haughtily     thou mockest me, sir
cos
abstractedly  sweet, gentle lalage
aless          heard i aright?
i speak to him--he speaks of lalage?
sir count
places her hand on his shoulder
what art thou dreaming?
hes not well
what ails thee, sir?
casstarting cousin fair cousin--madam
i crave thy pardon--indeed i am not well--
your hand from off my shoulder, if you please
this air is most oppressive--madam--the duke
enter di broglio
di broglio     my son, ive news for thee--hey

observing alessandra
i the pouts? kiss her, castiglione kiss her,
you dog and make it up, i say, this minute
ive news for you both politian is expected
hourly in rome--politian, earl of leicester
well have him at the wedding tis his first visit
to the imperial city
aless          what politian
of britain, earl of leicester?
di brog        the same, my love
well have him at the wedding a man quite young
in years, but gray in fame i have not seen him,
but rumor speaks of him as of a prodigy
pre-eminent in arts, and arms, and wealth,
and high descent well have him at the wedding
aless          i have heard much of this politian
gay, volatile and giddy--is he not,
and little given to thinking?
di brog        far from it, love
no branch, they say, of all philosophy
so deep abstruse he has not mastered it
learned as few are learned
aless          tis very strange
i have known men have seen politian
and sought his company they speak of him
as of one who entered madly into life,
drinking the cup of pleasure to the dregs
cas            ridiculous now i have seen politian
and know him well--nor learned nor mirthful he
he is a dreamer, and shut out
from common passions
di brog        children, we disagree
let us go forth and taste the fragrant air
of the garden did i dream, or did i hear
politian was a melancholy man?
exeunt
ii
rome--a ladys apartment, with a window open and looking into a garden
lalage, in deep mourning, reading at a table on which lie some books and
a hand-mirror in the background jacinta a servant maid leans
carelessly upon a chair
lalage         jacinta is it thou?
jacinta
pertly        yes, maam, im here
lal            i did not know, jacinta, you were in waiting
sit down--let not my presence trouble you--
sit down--for i am humble, most humble
jac aside   tis time
jacinta seats herself in a side-long manner upon the chair, resting
her elbows upon the back, and regarding her mistress with a contemptuous
look lalage continues to read
lal            it in another climate, so he said,
bore a bright golden flower, but not i this soil
pauses--turns over some leaves and resumes
no lingering winters there, nor snow, nor shower--
but ocean ever to refresh mankind
breathes the shrill spirit of the western wind
oh, beautiful--most beautiful--how like
to what my fevered soul doth dream of heaven
o happy land pauses she died--the maiden died
o still more happy maiden who couldst die
jacinta
jacinta returns no answer, and lalage presently resumes
again--a similar tale
told of a beauteous dame beyond the sea
thus speaketh one ferdinand in the words of the play--
she died full young--one bossola answers him--
i think not so--her infelicity
seemed to have years too many--ah, luckless lady
jacinta still no answer
heres a far sterner story--
but like--oh, very like in its despair--
of that egyptian queen, winning so easily
a thousand hearts--losing at length her own
she died thus endeth the history--and her maids
lean over her and keep--two gentle maids
with gentle names--eiros and charmion
rainbow and dove--jacinta
jac
pettishly    madam, what is it?
lal            wilt thou, my good jacinta, be so kind
as go down in the library and bring me
the holy evangelists?
jac            pshaw
exit
lal            if there be balm
for the wounded spirit in gilead, it is there
dew in the night time of my bitter trouble
will there be found--dew sweeter far than that
which hangs like chains of pearl on hermon hill
re-enter jacinta, and throws a volume on the table
there, maam, s the book
aside     indeed she is very troublesome
lal
astonished   what didst thou say, jacinta?
have i done aught
to grieve thee or to vex thee?--i am sorry
for thou hast served me long and ever been
trustworthy and respectful
resumes her reading
jac aside i cant believe
she has any more jewels--no--no--she gave me all
lal            what didst thou say, jacinta? now i bethink me
thou hast not spoken lately of thy wedding
how fares good ugo?--and when is it to be?
can i do aught?--is there no further aid
thou needest, jacinta?
jac aside is there no further aid
thats meant for me  im sure, madam, you need not
be always throwing those jewels in my teeth
lal            jewels jacinta,--now indeed, jacinta,
i thought not of the jewels
jac            oh, perhaps not
but then i might have sworn it after all,
theres ugo says the ring is only paste,
for hes sure the count castiglione never
would have given a real diamond to such as you
and at the best im certain, madam, you cannot
have use for jewels now but i might have sworn it
exit
lalage bursts into tears and leans her head upon the table--after a
short pause raises it
lal            poor lalage--and is it come to this?
thy servant maid--but courage--tis but a viper
whom thou hast cherished to sting thee to the soul
taking up the mirror
ha here at leasts a friend--too much a friend
in earlier days--a friend will not deceive thee
fair mirror and true now tell me for thou canst
a tale--a pretty tale--and heed thou not
though it be rife with woe it answers me
it speaks of sunken eyes, and wasted cheeks,
and beauty long deceased--remembers me,
of joy departed--hope, the seraph hope,
inurned and entombed--now, in a tone
low, sad, and solemn, but most audible,
whispers of early grave untimely yawning
for ruined maid fair mirror and true--thou liest not
thou hast no end to gain--no heart to break--
castiglione lied who said he loved----
thou true--he false--false--false
while she speaks, a monk enters her apartment and approaches
unobserved
monk           refuge thou hast,
sweet daughter in heaven think of eternal things
give up thy soul to penitence, and pray
lal
arising hurriedly i cannot pray--my soul is at war with god
the frightful sounds of merriment below
disturb my senses--go i cannot pray--
the sweet airs from the garden worry me
thy presence grieves me--go--thy priestly raiment
fills me with dread--thy ebony crucifix
with horror and awe
monk           think of thy precious soul
lal            think of my early days--think of my father
and mother in heaven think of our quiet home,
and the rivulet that ran before the door
think of my little sisters--think of them
and think of me--think of my trusting love
and confidence--his vows--my ruin--think--think
of my unspeakable misery----begone
yet stay yet stay--what was it thou saidst of prayer
and penitence? didst thou not speak of faith
and vows before the throne?
monk           i did
lal            tis well
there is a vow twere fitting should be made--
a sacred vow, imperative and urgent,
a solemn vow
monk           daughter, this zeal is well
lal            father, this zeal is anything but well
hast thou a crucifix fit for this thing?
a crucifix whereon to register
this sacred vow? he hands her his own
not that--oh no--no--no shuddering
not that not that--i tell thee, holy man,
thy raiments and thy ebony cross affright me
stand back i have a crucifix myself,--
i have a crucifix methinks twere fitting
the deed--the vow--the symbol of the deed--
and the deeds register should tally, father
draws a cross-handled dagger and raises it on high
behold the cross wherewith a vow like mine
is written in heaven
monk           thy words are madness, daughter,
and speak a purpose unholy--thy lips are livid--
thine eyes are wild--tempt not the wrath divine
pause ere too late--oh, be not--be not rash
swear not the oath--oh, swear it not
lal            tis sworn

an apartment in a palace politian and baldazzar
baldazzar      arouse thee now, politian
thou must not--nay indeed, indeed, thou shalt not
give way unto these humors be thyself
shake off the idle fancies that beset thee
and live, for now thou diest
politian       not so, baldazzar
surely i live
bal            politian, it doth grieve me
to see thee thus
pol            baldazzar, it doth grieve me
to give thee cause for grief, my honored friend
command me, sir what wouldst thou have me do?
at thy behest i will shake off that nature
which from my forefathers i did inherit,
which with my mothers milk i did imbibe,
and be no more politian, but some other
command me, sir
bal            to the field then--to the field--
to the senate or the field
pol            alas alas
there is an imp would follow me even there
there is an imp hath followed me even there
there is--what voice was that?
bal            i heard it not
i heard not any voice except thine own,
and the echo of thine own
pol            then i but dreamed
bal            give not thy soul to dreams the camp--the court
befit thee--fame awaits thee--glory calls--
and her the trumpet-tongued thou wilt not hear
in hearkening to imaginary sounds
and phantom voices
pol            it is a phantom voice
didst thou not hear it then?
bal             i heard it not
pol            thou heardst it not--baldazzar, speak no more
to me, politian, of thy camps and courts
oh i am sick, sick, sick, even unto death,
of the hollow and high-sounding vanities
of the populous earth bear with me yet awhile
we have been boys together--school-fellows--
and now are friends--yet shall not be so long--
for in the eternal city thou shalt do me
a kind and gentle office, and a power--
a power august, benignant, and supreme--
shall then absolve thee of all further duties
unto thy friend
bal            thou speakest a fearful riddle
i will not understand
pol            yet now as fate
approaches, and the hours are breathing low,
the sands of time are changed to golden grains,
and dazzle me, baldazzar alas alas
i cannot die, having within my heart
so keen a relish for the beautiful
as hath been kindled within it methinks the air
is balmier now than it was wont to be--
rich melodies are floating in the winds--
a rarer loveliness bedecks the earth--
and with a holier lustre the quiet moon
sitteth in heaven--hist hist thou canst not say
thou hearest not now, baldazzar?
bal            indeed i hear not
pol            not hear it--listen--now--listen--the faintest sound
and yet the sweetest that ear ever heard
a ladys voice--and sorrow in the tone
baldazzar, it oppresses me like a spell
again--again--how solemnly it falls
into my heart of hearts that eloquent voice
surely i never heard--yet it were well
had i but heard it with its thrilling tones
in earlier days
bal            i myself hear it now
be still--the voice, if i mistake not greatly,
proceeds from younder lattice--which you may see
very plainly through the window--it belongs,
does it not? unto this palace of the duke
the singer is undoubtedly beneath
the roof of his excellency--and perhaps
is even that alessandra of whom he spoke
as the betrothed of castiglione,
his son and heir
pol            be still--it comes again
voice
very faintly and is thy heart so strong
as for to leave me thus,
that have loved thee so long,
in wealth and woe among?
and is thy heart so strong
as for to leave me thus?
say nay say nay
bal            the song is english, and i oft have heard it
in merry england--never so plaintively--
hist hist it comes again
voice
more loudly   is it so strong
as for to leave me thus,
that have loved thee so long,
in wealth and woe among?
and is thy heart so strong
as for to leave me thus?
say nay say nay
bal            tis hushed and all is still
pol            all is not still
bal            let us go down
pol            go down, baldazzar, go
bal            the hour is growing late--the duke awaits us,--
thy presence is expected in the hall
below what ails thee, earl politian?
voice
distinctly   who have loved thee so long,
in wealth and woe among,
and is thy heart so strong?
say nay say nay
bal            let us descend--tis time politian, give
these fancies to the wind remember, pray,
your bearing lately savored much of rudeness
unto the duke arouse thee and remember
pol            remember? i do lead on i do remember
going
let us descend believe me i would give,
freely would give the broad lands of my earldom
to look upon the face hidden by yon lattice--
to gaze upon that veiled face, and hear
once more that silent tongue
bal            let me beg you, sir,
descend with me--the duke may be offended
let us go down, i pray you
voice loudly say nay--say nay
pol aside tis strange--tis very strange--methought
the voice
chimed in with my desires and bade me stay
approaching the window
sweet voice i heed thee, and will surely stay
now be this fancy, by heaven, or be it fate,
still will i not descend baldazzar, make
apology unto the duke for me
i go not down to-night
bal            your lordships pleasure
shall be attended to good-night, politian
pol            good-night, my friend, good-night
iv
the gardens of a palace--moonlight lalage and politian
lalage         and dost thou speak of love
to me, politian?--dost thou speak of love
to lalage?--ah woe--ah woe is me
this mockery is most cruel--most cruel indeed
politian       weep not oh, sob not thus--thy bitter tears
will madden me oh, mourn not, lalage--
be comforted i know--i know it all,
and still i speak of love look at me, brightest,
and beautiful lalage--turn here thine eyes
thou askest me if i could speak of love,
knowing what i know, and seeing what i have seen
thou askest me that--and thus i answer thee--
thus on my bended knee i answer thee kneeling
sweet lalage, i love thee--love thee--love thee
thro good and ill--thro weal and woe, i love thee
not mother, with her first-born on her knee,
thrills with intenser love than i for thee
not on gods altar, in any time or clime,
burned there a holier fire than burneth now
within my spirit for thee and do i love?
arising
even for thy woes i love thee--even for thy woes--
thy beauty and thy woes
lal            alas, proud earl,
thou dost forget thyself, remembering me
how, in thy fathers halls, among the maidens
pure and reproachless of thy princely line,
could the dishonored lalage abide?
thy wife, and with a tainted memory--
my seared and blighted name, how would it tally
with the ancestral honors of thy house,
and with thy glory?
pol            speak not to me of glory
i hate--i loathe the name i do abhor
the unsatisfactory and ideal thing
art thou not lalage, and i politian?
do i not love--art thou not beautiful--
what need we more? ha glory now speak not of it
by all i hold most sacred and most solemn--
by all my wishes now--my fears hereafter--
by all i scorn on earth and hope in heaven--
there is no deed i would more glory in,
than in thy cause to scoff at this same glory
and trample it under foot what matters it--
what matters it, my fairest, and my best,
that we go down unhonored and forgotten
into the dust--so we descend together?
descend together--and then--and then perchance--
lal            why dost thou pause, politian?
pol            and then perchance
arise together, lalage, and roam
the starry and quiet dwellings of the blest,
and still--
lal            why dost thou pause, politian?
pol            and still together--together
lal            now, earl of leicester
thou lovest me, and in my heart of hearts
i feel thou lovest me truly
pol            o lalage
throwing himself upon his knee
and lovest thou me?
lal            hist hush within the gloom
of yonder trees methought a figure passed--
a spectral figure, solemn, and slow, and noiseless--
like the grim shadow conscience, solemn and noiseless
walks across and returns
i was mistaken--twas but a giant bough
stirred by the autumn wind politian
pol            my lalage--my love why art thou moved?
why dost thou turn so pale? not conscience self,
far less a shadow which thou likenest to it,
should shake the firm spirit thus but the night wind
is chilly--and these melancholy boughs
throw over all things a gloom
lal            politian
thou speakest to me of love knowest thou the land
with which all tongues are busy--a land new found--
miraculously found by one of genoa--
a thousand leagues within the golden west?
a fairy land of flowers, and fruit, and sunshine,--
and crystal lakes, and over-arching forests,
and mountains, around whose towering summits the winds
of heaven untrammelled flow--which air to breathe
is happiness now, and will be freedom hereafter
in days that are to come?
pol            oh, wilt thou--wilt thou
fly to that paradise--my lalage, wilt thou
fly thither with me? there care shall be forgotten,
and sorrow shall be no more, and eros be all
and life shall then be mine, for i will live
for thee, and in thine eyes--and thou shalt be
no more a mourner--but the radiant joys
shall wait upon thee, and the angel hope
attend thee ever and i will kneel to thee
and worship thee, and call thee my beloved,
my own, my beautiful, my love, my wife,
my all--oh, wilt thou--wilt thou, lalage,
fly thither with me?
lal            a deed is to be done--
castiglione lives
pol            and he shall die
exit

after a pause and--he--shall--die--alas
castiglione die? who spoke the words?
where am i?--what was it he said?--politian
thou art not gone--thou art not gone, politian
i feel thou art not gone--yet dare not look,
lest i behold thee not--thou couldst not go
with those words upon thy lips--oh, speak to me
and let me hear thy voice--one word--one word,
to say thou art not gone,--one little sentence,
to say how thou dost scorn--how thou dost hate
my womanly weakness ha ha thou art not gone--
oh, speak to me i knew thou wouldst not go
i knew thou wouldst not, couldst not, durst not go
villain, thou art not gone--thou mockest me
and thus i clutch thee--thus--he is gone, he is gone--
gone--gone where am i?--tis well--tis very well
so that the blade be keen--the blow be sure,
tis well, tis very well--alas alas

and much i fear me ill--it will not do
to die ere i have lived--stay--stay thy hand,

of darkness and the tomb, oh, pity me
oh, pity me let me not perish now,
in the budding of my paradisal hope
give me to live yet--yet a little while
tis i who pray for life--i who so late
demanded but to die--what sayeth the count?
enter baldazzar
baldazzar      that, knowing no cause of quarrel or of feud
between the earl politian and himself,
he doth decline your cartel
pol            what didst thou say?
what answer was it you brought me, good baldazzar?
with what excessive fragrance the zephyr comes
laden from yonder bowers--a fairer day,
or one more worthy italy, methinks
no mortal eyes have seen--what said the count?
bal            that he, castiglione, not being aware
of any feud existing, or any cause
of quarrel between your lordship and himself,
cannot accept the challenge
pol            it is most true--
all this is very true when saw you, sir,
when saw you now, baldazzar, in the frigid
ungenial britain which we left so lately,
a heaven so calm as this--so utterly free
from the evil taint of clouds?--and he did say?
bal            no more, my lord, than i have told you
the count castiglione will not fight
having no cause for quarrel
pol            now this is true--
all very true thou art my friend, baldazzar,
and i have not forgotten it--thoult do me
a piece of service wilt thou go back and say
unto this man, that i, the earl of leicester,
hold him a villain?--thus much, i prythee, say
unto the count--it is exceeding just
he should have cause for quarrel
bal            my lord--my friend--
pol aside tis he--he comes himself
aloud thou reasonest well
i know what thou wouldst say--not send the message--
well--i will think of it--i will not send it
now prythee, leave me--hither doth come a person
with whom affairs of a most private nature
i would adjust

dost thou not, that i am here?
cas            my lord, some strange,
some singular mistake--misunderstanding--
hath without doubt arisen thou hast been urged
thereby, in heat of anger, to address
some words most unaccountable, in writing,
to me, castiglione the bearer being
baldazzar, duke of surrey i am aware
of nothing which might warrant thee in this thing,
having given thee no offence ha--am i right?
twas a mistake?--undoubtedly--we all

avaunt--i will not fight thee--indeed i dare not
pol            thou wilt not fight with me didst say, sir count?
shall i be baffled thus?--now this is well
didst say thou darest not? ha

hold off thy hand--with that beloved name
so fresh upon thy lips i will not fight thee--
i cannot--dare not

i do believe thee--coward, i do believe thee
cas            ha--coward--this may not be
clutches his sword and staggers towards politian, but his purpose is
changed before reaching him, and he falls upon hia knee at the feet of
the earl
alas my lord,
it is--it is--most true in such a cause
i am the veriest coward oh, pity me
pol
greatly softened alas--i do--indeed i pity thee

thus on my bended knee it were most fitting
that in this deep humiliation i perish
for in the fight i will not raise a hand
against thee, earl of leicester strike thou home--
baring his bosom
here is no let or hindrance to thy weapon--
strike home i will not fight thee
pol            nows death and hell
am i not--am i not sorely--grievously tempted
to take thee at thy word? but mark me, sir
think not to fly me thus do thou prepare
for public insult in the streets--before
the eyes of the citizens ill follow thee--
like an avenging spirit ill follow thee
even unto death before those whom thou lovest--
before all rome ill taunt thee, villain,--ill taunt
thee,
dost hear? with cowardice--thou wilt not fight me?
thou liest thou shalt
exit
cas            now this indeed is just
most righteous, and most just, avenging heaven

duke           why do you laugh?
castiglione    indeed
i hardly know myself stay was it not
on yesterday we were speaking of the earl?
of the earl politian? yes it was yesterday
alessandra, you and i, you must remember
we were walking in the garden
duke           perfectly
i do remember it--what of it--what then?
cas            o nothing--nothing at all
duke           nothing at all
it is most singular that you should laugh
at nothing at all
cas            most singular--singular
duke           look yon, castiglione, be so kind
as tell me, sir, at once what tis you mean
what are you talking of?
cas            was it not so?
we differed in opinion touching him
duke           him--whom?
cas            why, sir, the earl politian
duke           the earl of leicester yes--is it he you mean?
we differed, indeed if i now recollect
the words you used were that the earl you knew
was neither learned nor mirthful
cas            ha ha--now did i?
duke           that did you, sir, and well i knew at the time
you were wrong, it being not the character
of the earl--whom all the world allows to be
a most hilarious man be not, my son,
too positive again
cas            tis singular
most singular i could not think it possible
so little time could so much alter one
to say the truth about an hour ago,
as i was walking with the count san ozzo,
all arm in arm, we met this very man
the earl--he, with his friend baldazzar,
having just arrived in rome ha ha he is altered
such an account he gave me of his journey
twould have made you die with laughter--such tales he
told
of his caprices and his merry freaks
along the road--such oddity--such humor--
such wit--such whim--such flashes of wild merriment
set off too in such full relief by the grave
demeanor of his friend--who, to speak the truth
was gravity itself--
duke           did i not tell you?
cas            you did--and yet tis strange but true, as strange,
how much i was mistaken i always thought
the earl a gloomy man
duke           so, so, you see
be not too positive whom have we here?
it cannot be the earl?
cas            the earl oh no
tis not the earl--but yet it is--and leaning
upon his friend baldazzar ah welcome, sir
enter politian and baldazzar
my lord, a second welcome let me give you
to rome--his grace the duke of broglio
father this is the earl politian, earl
of leicester in great britain
politian bows haughtily
that, his friend
baldazzar, duke of surrey the earl has letters,
so please you, for your grace
duke           ha ha most welcome
to rome and to our palace, earl politian
and you, most noble duke i am glad to see you
i knew your father well, my lord politian
castiglione call your cousin hither,
and let me make the noble earl acquainted
with your betrothed you come, sir, at a time
most seasonable the wedding--
politian       touching those letters, sir,
your son made mention of--your son, is he not?--
touching those letters, sir, i wot not of them
if such there be, my friend baldazzar here--
baldazzar ah--my friend baldazzar here
will hand them to your grace i would retire
duke           retire--so soon?
cas            what ho benito rupert
his lordships chambers--show his lordship to them
his lordship is unwell
enter benito
ben            this way, my lord
exit, followed by politian
duke           retire unwell
bal            so please you, sir i fear me
tis as you say--his lordship is unwell
the damp air of the evening--the fatigue
of a long journey--the--indeed i had better
follow his lordship he must be unwell
i will return anon
duke           return anon
now this is very strange castiglione
this way, my son, i wish to speak with thee
you surely were mistaken in what you said
of the earl, mirthful, indeed--which of us said
politian was a melancholy man?

poems of youth

sonnet--to science
science true daughter of old time thou art
who alterest all things with thy peering eyes
why preyest thou thus upon the poets heart,
vulture, whose wings are dull realities
how should he love thee? or how deem thee wise,
who wouldst not leave him in his wandering
to seek for treasure in the jewelled skies,
albeit he soared with an undaunted wing
hast thou not dragged diana from her car?
and driven the hamadryad from the wood
to seek a shelter in some happier star?
hast thou not torn the naiad from her flood,
the elfin from the green grass, and from me
the summer dream beneath the tamarind tree?



al aaraaf
part i
o nothing earthly save the ray
thrown back from flowers of beautys eye,
as in those gardens where the day
springs from the gems of circassy--
o nothing earthly save the thrill
of melody in woodland rill--
or music of the passion-hearted
joys voice so peacefully departed
that like the murmur in the shell,
its echo dwelleth and will dwell--
o nothing of the dross of ours--
yet all the beauty--all the flowers
that list our love, and deck our bowers--
adorn yon world afar, afar--
the wandering star
twas a sweet time for nesace--for there
her world lay lolling on the golden air,
near four bright suns--a temporary rest--
an oasis in desert of the blest
away away--mid seas of rays that roll
empyrean splendor oer th unchained soul--
the soul that scarce the billows are so dense
can struggle to its destind eminence--
to distant spheres, from time to time, she rode,
and late to ours, the favourd one of god--
but, now, the ruler of an anchord realm,
she throws aside the sceptre--leaves the helm,
and, amid incense and high spiritual hymns,
laves in quadruple light her angel limbs
now happiest, loveliest in yon lovely earth,
whence sprang the idea of beauty into birth,
falling in wreaths thro many a startled star,
like womans hair mid pearls, until, afar,
it lit on hills achaian, and there dwelt,
she lookd into infinity--and knelt
rich clouds, for canopies, about her curled--
fit emblems of the model of her world--
seen but in beauty--not impeding sight--
of other beauty glittering thro the light--
a wreath that twined each starry form around,
and all the opald air in color bound
all hurriedly she knelt upon a bed
of flowers of lilies such as reard the head
on the fair capo deucato , and sprang
so eagerly around about to hang
upon the flying footsteps of--deep pride--
of her who lovd a mortal--and so died
the sephalica, budding with young bees,
upreard its purple stem around her knees
and gemmy flower, of trebizond misnamd --
inmate of highest stars, where erst it shamd
all other loveliness its honied dew
the fabled nectar that the heathen knew
deliriously sweet, was droppd from heaven,
and fell on gardens of the unforgiven
in trebizond--and on a sunny flower
so like its own above that, to this hour,
it still remaineth, torturing the bee
with madness, and unwonted reverie
in heaven, and all its environs, the leaf
and blossom of the fairy plant, in grief
disconsolate linger--grief that hangs her head,
repenting follies that full long have fled,
heaving her white breast to the balmy air,
like guilty beauty, chastend, and more fair
nyctanthes too, as sacred as the light
she fears to perfume, perfuming the night
and clytia  pondering between many a sun,
while pettish tears adown her petals run
and that aspiring flower that sprang on earth --
and died, ere scarce exalted into birth,
bursting its odorous heart in spirit to wing
its way to heaven, from garden of a king
and valisnerian lotus thither flown
from struggling with the waters of the rhone
and thy most lovely purple perfume, zante
isola doro--fior di levante
and the nelumbo bud that floats for ever
with indian cupid down the holy river--
fair flowers, and fairy to whose care is given
to bear the goddess song, in odors, up to heaven
spirit that dwellest where,
in the deep sky,
the terrible and fair,
in beauty vie
beyond the line of blue--
the boundary of the star
which turneth at the view
of thy barrier and thy bar--
of the barrier overgone
by the comets who were cast
from their pride, and from their throne
to be drudges till the last--
to be carriers of fire
the red fire of their heart
with speed that may not tire
and with pain that shall not part--
who livest--that we know--
in eternity--we feel--
but the shadow of whose brow
what spirit shall reveal?
tho the beings whom thy nesace,
thy messenger hath known
have dreamd for thy infinity
a model of their own --
thy will is done, o god
the star hath ridden high
thro many a tempest, but she rode
beneath thy burning eye
and here, in thought, to thee--
in thought that can alone
ascend thy empire and so be
a partner of thy throne--
by winged fantasy ,
my embassy is given,
till secrecy shall knowledge be
in the environs of heaven
she ceasd--and buried then her burning cheek
abashd, amid the lilies there, to seek
a shelter from the fervor of his eye
for the stars trembled at the deity
she stirrd not--breathd not--for a voice was there
how solemnly pervading the calm air
a sound of silence on the startled ear
which dreamy poets name the music of the sphere
ours is a world of words quiet we call
silence--which is the merest word of all
all nature speaks, and evn ideal things
flap shadowy sounds from the visionary wings--
but ah not so when, thus, in realms on high
the eternal voice of god is passing by,
and the red winds are withering in the sky
what tho in worlds which sightless cycles run ,
linkd to a little system, and one sun--
where all my love is folly, and the crowd
still think my terrors but the thunder cloud,
the storm, the earthquake, and the ocean-wrath
ah will they cross me in my angrier path?
what tho in worlds which own a single sun
the sands of time grow dimmer as they run,
yet thine is my resplendency, so given
to bear my secrets thro the upper heaven
leave tenantless thy crystal home, and fly,
with all thy train, athwart the moony sky--
apart--like fire-flies in sicilian night ,
and wing to other worlds another light
divulge the secrets of thy embassy
to the proud orbs that twinkle--and so be
to evry heart a barrier and a ban
lest the stars totter in the guilt of man
up rose the maiden in the yellow night,
the single-mooned eve-on earth we plight
our faith to one love--and one moon adore--
the birth-place of young beauty had no more
as sprang that yellow star from downy hours,
up rose the maiden from her shrine of flowers,
and bent oer sheeny mountain and dim plain
her way--but left not yet her therasan reign
part ii
high on a mountain of enamelld head--
such as the drowsy shepherd on his bed
of giant pasturage lying at his ease,
raising his heavy eyelid, starts and sees
with many a mutterd hope to be forgiven
what time the moon is quadrated in heaven--
of rosy head, that towering far away
into the sunlit ether, caught the ray
of sunken suns at eve--at noon of night,
while the moon dancd with the fair stranger light--
upreard upon such height arose a pile
of gorgeous columns on th uuburthend air,
flashing from parian marble that twin smile
far down upon the wave that sparkled there,
and nursled the young mountain in its lair
of molten stars their pavement, such as fall
thro the ebon air, besilvering the pall
of their own dissolution, while they die--
adorning then the dwellings of the sky
a dome, by linked light from heaven let down,
sat gently on these columns as a crown--
a window of one circular diamond, there,
lookd out above into the purple air
and rays from god shot down that meteor chain
and hallowd all the beauty twice again,
save when, between th empyrean and that ring,
some eager spirit flappd his dusky wing
but on the pillars seraph eyes have seen
the dimness of this world that grayish green
that nature loves the best for beautys grave
lurkd in each cornice, round each architrave--
and every sculptured cherub thereabout
that from his marble dwelling peered out,
seemd earthly in the shadow of his niche--
achaian statues in a world so rich?
friezes from tadmor and persepolis --
from balbec, and the stilly, clear abyss
of beautiful gomorrah oh, the wave
is now upon thee--but too late to save
sound loves to revel in a summer night
witness the murmur of the gray twilight
that stole upon the ear, in eyraco ,
of many a wild star-gazer long ago--
that stealeth ever on the ear of him
who, musing, gazeth on the distance dim,
and sees the darkness coming as a cloud--
is not its form--its voice--most palpable and loud?
but what is this?--it cometh--and it brings
a music with it--tis the rush of wings--
a pause--and then a sweeping, falling strain,
and nesace is in her halls again
from the wild energy of wanton haste
her cheeks were flushing, and her lips apart
the zone that clung around her gentle waist
had burst beneath the heaving of her heart
within the centre of that hall to breathe
she pausd and panted, zanthe all beneath,
the fairy light that kissd her golden hair
and longd to rest, yet could but sparkle there
young flowers were whispering in melody
to happy flowers that night--and tree to tree
fountains were gushing music as they fell
in many a star-lit grove, or moon-light dell
yet silence came upon material things--
fair flowers, bright waterfalls and angel wings--
and sound alone that from the spirit sprang
bore burthen to the charm the maiden sang
neath blue-bell or streamer--
or tufted wild spray
that keeps, from the dreamer,
the moonbeam away--
bright beings that ponder,
with half-closing eyes,
on the stars which your wonder
hath drawn from the skies,
till they glance thro the shade, and
come down to your brow
like--eyes of the maiden
who calls on you now--
arise from your dreaming
in violet bowers,
to duty beseeming
these star-litten hours--
and shake from your tresses
encumberd with dew
the breath of those kisses
that cumber them too--
o how, without you, love
could angels be blest?
those kisses of true love
that lulld ye to rest
up shake from your wing
each hindering thing
the dew of the night--
it would weigh down your flight
and true love caresses--
o leave them apart
they are light on the tresses,
but lead on the heart
ligeia ligeia
my beautiful one
whose harshest idea
will to melody run,
o is it thy will
on the breezes to toss?
or, capriciously still,
like the lone albatross,
incumbent on night
as she on the air
to keep watch with delight
on the harmony there?
ligeia wherever
thy image may be,
no magic shall sever
thy music from thee
thou hast bound many eyes
in a dreamy sleep--
but the strains still arise
which thy vigilance keep--
the sound of the rain
which leaps down to the flower,
and dances again
in the rhythm of the shower--
the murmur that springs
from the growing of grass
are the music of things--
but are modelld, alas
away, then, my dearest,
o hie thee away
to springs that lie clearest
beneath the moon-ray--
to lone lake that smiles,
in its dream of deep rest,
at the many star-isles
that enjewel its breast--
where wild flowers, creeping,
have mingled their shade,
on its margin is sleeping
full many a maid--
some have left the cool glade, and
have slept with the bee--
arouse them, my maiden,
on moorland and lea--
go breathe on their slumber,
all softly in ear,
the musical number
they slumberd to hear--
for what can awaken
an angel so soon
whose sleep hath been taken
beneath the cold moon,
as the spell which no slumber
of witchery may test,
the rhythmical number
which lulld him to rest?
spirits in wing, and angels to the view,
a thousand seraphs burst th empyrean thro,
young dreams still hovering on their drowsy flight--
seraphs in all but knowledge, the keen light
that fell, refracted, thro thy bounds afar,
o death from eye of god upon that star
sweet was that error--sweeter still that death--
sweet was that error--evn with us the breath
of science dims the mirror of our joy--
to them twere the simoom, and would destroy--
for what to them availeth it to know
that truth is falsehood--or that bliss is woe?
sweet was their death--with them to die was rife
with the last ecstasy of satiate life--
beyond that death no immortality--
but sleep that pondereth and is not to be--
and there--oh may my weary spirit dwell--
apart from heavens eternity--and yet how far from hell
what guilty spirit, in what shrubbery dim
heard not the stirring summons of that hymn?
but two they fell for heaven no grace imparts
to those who hear not for their beating hearts
a maiden-angel and her seraph-lover--
o where and ye may seek the wide skies over
was love, the blind, near sober duty known?
unguided love hath fallen--mid tears of perfect moan
he was a goodly spirit--he who fell
a wanderer by mossy-mantled well--
a gazer on the lights that shine above--
a dreamer in the moonbeam by his love
what wonder? for each star is eye-like there,
and looks so sweetly down on beautys hair--
and they, and evry mossy spring were holy
to his love-haunted heart and melancholy
the night had found to him a night of wo
upon a mountain crag, young angelo--
beetling it bends athwart the solemn sky,
and scowls on starry worlds that down beneath it lie
here sate he with his love--his dark eye bent
with eagle gaze along the firmament
now turnd it upon her--but ever then
it trembled to the orb of earth again
ianthe, dearest, see how dim that ray
how lovely tis to look so far away
she seemed not thus upon that autumn eve
i left her gorgeous halls--nor mourned to leave,
that eve--that eve--i should remember well--
the sun-ray dropped, in lemnos with a spell
on th arabesque carving of a gilded hall
wherein i sate, and on the draperied wall--
and on my eyelids--o, the heavy light
how drowsily it weighed them into night
on flowers, before, and mist, and love they ran
with persian saadi in his gulistan
but o, that light--i slumbered--death, the while,
stole oer my senses in that lovely isle
so softly that no single silken hair
awoke that slept--or knew that he was there
the last spot of earths orb i trod upon
was a proud temple called the parthenon
more beauty clung around her columned wall
then even thy glowing bosom beats withal,
and when old time my wing did disenthral
thence sprang i--as the eagle from his tower,
and years i left behind me in an hour
what time upon her airy bounds i hung,
one half the garden of her globe was flung
unrolling as a chart unto my view--
tenantless cities of the desert too
ianthe, beauty crowded on me then,
and half i wished to be again of men
my angelo and why of them to be?
a brighter dwelling-place is here for thee--
and greener fields than in yon world above,
and womans loveliness--and passionate love
but list, ianthe when the air so soft
failed, as my pennoned spirit leapt aloft,
perhaps my brain grew dizzy--but the world
i left so late was into chaos hurled,
sprang from her station, on the winds apart,
and rolled a flame, the fiery heaven athwart
methought, my sweet one, then i ceased to soar,
and fell--not swiftly as i rose before,
but with a downward, tremulous motion thro
light, brazen rays, this golden star unto
nor long the measure of my falling hours,
for nearest of all stars was thine to ours--
dread star that came, amid a night of mirth,
a red daedalion on the timid earth
we came--and to thy earth--but not to us
be given our ladys bidding to discuss
we came, my love around, above, below,
gay fire-fly of the night we come and go,
nor ask a reason save the angel-nod
she grants to us as granted by her god--
but, angelo, than thine gray time unfurled
never his fairy wing oer fairer world
dim was its little disk, and angel eyes
alone could see the phantom in the skies,
when first al aaraaf knew her course to be
headlong thitherward oer the starry sea--
but when its glory swelled upon the sky,
as glowing beautys bust beneath mans eye,
we paused before the heritage of men,
and thy star trembled--as doth beauty then
thus in discourse, the lovers whiled away
the night that waned and waned and brought no day
they fell for heaven to them no hope imparts
who hear not for the beating of their hearts

tamerlane
kind solace in a dying hour
such, father, is not now my theme--
i will not madly deem that power
of earth may shrive me of the sin
unearthly pride hath revelled in--
i have no time to dote or dream
you call it hope--that fire of fire
it is but agony of desire
if i can hope--o god i can--
its fount is holier--more divine--
i would not call thee fool, old man,
but such is not a gift of thine
know thou the secret of a spirit
bowed from its wild pride into shame
o yearning heart i did inherit
thy withering portion with the fame,
the searing glory which hath shone
amid the jewels of my throne,
halo of hell and with a pain
not hell shall make me fear again--
o craving heart, for the lost flowers
and sunshine of my summer hours
the undying voice of that dead time,
with its interminable chime,
rings, in the spirit of a spell,
upon thy emptiness--a knell
i have not always been as now
the fevered diadem on my brow
i claimed and won usurpingly--
hath not the same fierce heirdom given
rome to the csar--this to me?
the heritage of a kingly mind,
and a proud spirit which hath striven
triumphantly with human kind
on mountain soil i first drew life
the mists of the taglay have shed
nightly their dews upon my head,
and, i believe, the winged strife
and tumult of the headlong air
have nestled in my very hair
so late from heaven--that dew--it fell
mid dreams of an unholy night
upon me with the touch of hell,
while the red flashing of the light
from clouds that hung, like banners, oer,
appeared to my half-closing eye
the pageantry of monarchy
and the deep trumpet-thunders roar
came hurriedly upon me, telling
of human battle, where my voice,
my own voice, silly child--was swelling
o how my spirit would rejoice,
and leap within me at the cry
the battle-cry of victory
the rain came down upon my head
unsheltered--and the heavy wind
rendered me mad and deaf and blind
it was but man, i thought, who shed
laurels upon me and the rush--
the torrent of the chilly air
gurgled within my ear the crush
of empires--with the captives prayer--
the hum of suitors--and the tone
of flattery round a sovereigns throne
my passions, from that hapless hour,
usurped a tyranny which men
have deemed since i have reached to power,
my innate nature--be it so
but, father, there lived one who, then,
then--in my boyhood--when their fire
burned with a still intenser glow
for passion must, with youth, expire
een then who knew this iron heart
in womans weakness had a part
i have no words--alas--to tell
the loveliness of loving well
nor would i now attempt to trace
the more than beauty of a face
whose lineaments, upon my mind,
are--shadows on th unstable wind
thus i remember having dwelt
some page of early lore upon,
with loitering eye, till i have felt
the letters--with their meaning--melt
to fantasies--with none
o, she was worthy of all love
love as in infancy was mine--
twas such as angel minds above
might envy her young heart the shrine
on which my every hope and thought
were incense--then a goodly gift,
for they were childish and upright--
pure--as her young example taught
why did i leave it, and, adrift,
trust to the fire within, for light?
we grew in age--and love--together--
roaming the forest, and the wild
my breast her shield in wintry weather--
and, when the friendly sunshine smiled
and she would mark the opening skies,
i saw no heaven--but in her eyes
young loves first lesson is----the heart
for mid that sunshine, and those smiles,
when, from our little cares apart,
and laughing at her girlish wiles,
id throw me on her throbbing breast,
and pour my spirit out in tears--
there was no need to speak the rest--
no need to quiet any fears
of her--who asked no reason why,
but turned on me her quiet eye
yet more than worthy of the love
my spirit struggled with, and strove
when, on the mountain peak, alone,
ambition lent it a new tone--
i had no being--but in thee
the world, and all it did contain
in the earth--the air--the sea--
its joy--its little lot of pain
that was new pleasure--the ideal,
dim, vanities of dreams by night--
and dimmer nothings which were real--
shadows--and a more shadowy light
parted upon their misty wings,
and, so, confusedly, became
thine image and--a name--a name
two separate--yet most intimate things
i was ambitious--have you known
the passion, father? you have not
a cottager, i marked a throne
of half the world as all my own,
and murmured at such lowly lot--
but, just like any other dream,
upon the vapor of the dew
my own had past, did not the beam
of beauty which did while it thro
the minute--the hour--the day--oppress
my mind with double loveliness
we walked together on the crown
of a high mountain which looked down
afar from its proud natural towers
of rock and forest, on the hills--
the dwindled hills begirt with bowers
and shouting with a thousand rills
i spoke to her of power and pride,
but mystically--in such guise
that she might deem it nought beside
the moments converse in her eyes
i read, perhaps too carelessly--
a mingled feeling with my own--
the flush on her bright cheek, to me
seemed to become a queenly throne
too well that i should let it be
light in the wilderness alone
i wrapped myself in grandeur then,
and donned a visionary crown--
yet it was not that fantasy
had thrown her mantle over me--
but that, among the rabble--men,
lion ambition is chained down--
and crouches to a keepers hand--
not so in deserts where the grand--
the wild--the terrible conspire
with their own breath to fan his fire
look round thee now on samarcand--
is she not queen of earth? her pride
above all cities? in her hand
their destinies? in all beside
of glory which the world hath known
stands she not nobly and alone?
falling--her veriest stepping-stone
shall form the pedestal of a throne--
and who her sovereign? timour--he
whom the astonished people saw
striding oer empires haughtily
a diademed outlaw
o, human love thou spirit given,
on earth, of all we hope in heaven
which fallst into the soul like rain
upon the siroc-withered plain,
and, failing in thy power to bless,
but leavst the heart a wilderness
idea which bindest life around
with music of so strange a sound
and beauty of so wild a birth--
farewell for i have won the earth
when hope, the eagle that towered, could see
no cliff beyond him in the sky,
his pinions were bent droopingly--
and homeward turned his softened eye
twas sunset when the sun will part
there comes a sullenness of heart
to him who still would look upon
the glory of the summer sun
that soul will hate the evning mist
so often lovely, and will list
to the sound of the coming darkness known
to those whose spirits hearken as one
who, in a dream of night, would fly,
but cannot, from a danger nigh
what tho the moon--tho the white moon
shed all the splendor of her noon,
her smile is chilly--and her beam,
in that time of dreariness, will seem
so like you gather in your breath
a portrait taken after death
and boyhood is a summer sun
whose waning is the dreariest one--
for all we live to know is known,
and all we seek to keep hath flown--
let life, then, as the day-flower, fall
with the noon-day beauty--which is all
i reached my home--my home no more--
for all had flown who made it so
i passed from out its mossy door,
and, tho my tread was soft and low,
a voice came from the threshold stone
of one whom i had earlier known--
o, i defy thee, hell, to show
on beds of fire that burn below,
an humbler heart--a deeper woe
father, i firmly do believe--
i know--for death who comes for me
from regions of the blest afar,
where there is nothing to deceive,
hath left his iron gate ajar
and rays of truth you cannot see
are flashing thro eternity----
i do believe that eblis hath
a snare in every human path--
else how, when in the holy grove
i wandered of the idol, love,--
who daily scents his snowy wings
with incense of burnt-offerings
from the most unpolluted things,
whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven
above with trellised rays from heaven
no mote may shun--no tiniest fly--
the lightning of his eagle eye--
how was it that ambition crept,
unseen, amid the revels there,
till growing bold, he laughed and leapt
in the tangles of loves very hair


to helen
helen, thy beauty is to me
like those nicean barks of yore,
that gently, oer a perfumed sea,
the weary, wayworn wanderer bore
to his own native shore
on desperate seas long wont to roam,
thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,
thy naiad airs have brought me home
to the glory that was greece,
to the grandeur that was rome
lo in yon brilliant window niche,
how statue-like i see thee stand,
the agate lamp within thy hand
ah, psyche, from the regions which
are holy land


the valley of unrest
once it smiled a silent dell
where the people did not dwell
they had gone unto the wars,
trusting to the mild-eyed stars,
nightly, from their azure towers,
to keep watch above the flowers,
in the midst of which all day
the red sun-light lazily lay,
now each visitor shall confess
the sad valleys restlessness
nothing there is motionless--
nothing save the airs that brood
over the magic solitude
ah, by no wind are stirred those trees
that palpitate like the chill seas
around the misty hebrides
ah, by no wind those clouds are driven
that rustle through the unquiet heaven
unceasingly, from morn till even,
over the violets there that lie
in myriad types of the human eye--
over the lilies that wave
and weep above a nameless grave
they wave--from out their fragrant tops
eternal dews come down in drops
they weep--from off their delicate stems
perennial tears descend in gems


israfel
in heaven a spirit doth dwell
whose heart-strings are a lute
none sing so wildly well
as the angel israfel,
and the giddy stars so legends tell,
ceasing their hymns, attend the spell
of his voice, all mute
tottering above
in her highest noon,
the enamoured moon
blushes with love,
while, to listen, the red levin
with the rapid pleiads, even,
which were seven,
pauses in heaven
and they say the starry choir
and the other listening things
that israfelis fire
is owing to that lyre
by which he sits and sings--
the trembling living wire
of those unusual strings
but the skies that angel trod,
where deep thoughts are a duty--
where loves a grow-up god--
where the houri glances are
imbued with all the beauty
which we worship in a star
therefore, thou art not wrong,
israfeli, who despisest
an unimpassioned song
to thee the laurels belong,
best bard, because the wisest
merrily live and long
the ecstasies above
with thy burning measures suit--
thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love,
with the fervor of thy lute--
well may the stars be mute
yes, heaven is thine but this
is a world of sweets and sours
our flowers are merely--flowers,
and the shadow of thy perfect bliss
is the sunshine of ours
if i could dwell
where israfel
hath dwelt, and he where i,
he might not sing so wildly well
a mortal melody,
while a bolder note than this might swell
from my lyre within the sky


to----
i heed not that my earthly lot
hath--little of earth in it--
that years of love have been forgot
in the hatred of a minute--
i mourn not that the desolate
are happier, sweet, than i,
but that you sorrow for my fate
who am a passer-by


to----
the bowers whereat, in dreams, i see
the wantonest singing birds,
are lips--and all thy melody
of lip-begotten words--
thine eyes, in heaven of heart enshrined
then desolately fall,
o god on my funereal mind
like starlight on a pall--
thy heart--thy heart--i wake and sigh,
and sleep to dream till day
of the truth that gold can never buy--
of the baubles that it may


to the river
fair river in thy bright, clear flow
of crystal, wandering water,
thou art an emblem of the glow
of beauty--the unhidden heart--
the playful maziness of art
in old albertos daughter
but when within thy wave she looks--
which glistens then, and trembles--
why, then, the prettiest of brooks
her worshipper resembles
for in his heart, as in thy stream,
her image deeply lies--
his heart which trembles at the beam
of her soul-searching eyes


song
i saw thee on thy bridal day--
when a burning blush came oer thee,
though happiness around thee lay,
the world all love before thee
and in thine eye a kindling light
whatever it might be
was all on earth my aching sight
of loveliness could see
that blush, perhaps, was maiden shame--
as such it well may pass--
though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame
in the breast of him, alas
who saw thee on that bridal day,
when that deep blush would come oer thee,
though happiness around thee lay,
the world all love before thee


spirits of the dead
thy soul shall find itself alone
mid dark thoughts of the gray tombstone
not one, of all the crowd, to pry
into thine hour of secrecy
be silent in that solitude
which is not loneliness--for then
the spirits of the dead who stood
in life before thee are again
in death around thee--and their will
shall overshadow thee be still
the night--tho clear--shall frown--
and the stars shall not look down
from their high thrones in the heaven,
with light like hope to mortals given--
but their red orbs, without beam,
to thy weariness shall seem
as a burning and a fever
which would cling to thee forever
now are thoughts thou shalt not banish--
now are visions neer to vanish--
from thy spirit shall they pass
no more--like dew-drops from the grass
the breeze--the breath of god--is still--
and the mist upon the hill
shadowy--shadowy--yet unbroken,
is a symbol and a token--
how it hangs upon the trees,
a mystery of mysteries


a dream
in visions of the dark night
i have dreamed of joy departed--
but a waking dream of life and light
hath left me broken-hearted
ah what is not a dream by day
to him whose eyes are cast
on things around him with a ray
turned back upon the past?
that holy dream--that holy dream,
while all the world were chiding,
hath cheered me as a lovely beam,
a lonely spirit guiding
what though that light, thro storm and night,
so trembled from afar--
what could there be more purely bright
in truths day star?


romance
romance, who loves to nod and sing,
with drowsy head and folded wing,
among the green leaves as they shake
far down within some shadowy lake,
to me a painted paroquet
hath been--a most familiar bird--
taught me my alphabet to say--
to lisp my very earliest word
while in the wild wood i did lie,
a child--with a most knowing eye
of late, eternal condor years
so shake the very heaven on high
with tumult as they thunder by,
i have no time for idle cares
though gazing on the unquiet sky
and when an hour with calmer wings
its down upon my spirit flings--
that little time with lyre and rhyme
to while away--forbidden things
my heart would feel to be a crime
unless it trembled with the strings


fairyland
dim vales--and shadowy floods--
and cloudy-looking woods,
whose forms we cant discover
for the tears that drip all over
huge moons there wax and wane--
again--again--again--
every moment of the night--
forever changing places--
and they put out the star-light
with the breath from their pale faces
about twelve by the moon-dial
one more filmy than the rest
a kind which, upon trial,
they have found to be the best
comes down--still down--and down
with its centre on the crown
of a mountains eminence,
while its wide circumference
in easy drapery falls
over hamlets, over halls,
wherever they may be--
oer the strange woods--oer the sea--
over spirits on the wing--
over every drowsy thing--
and buries them up quite
in a labyrinth of light--
and then, how deep--o, deep
is the passion of their sleep
in the morning they arise,
and their moony covering
is soaring in the skies,
with the tempests as they toss,
like--almost any thing--
or a yellow albatross
they use that moon no more
for the same end as before--
videlicet a tent--
which i think extravagant
its atomies, however,
into a shower dissever,
of which those butterflies,
of earth, who seek the skies,
and so come down again
never-contented thing
have brought a specimen
upon their quivering wings


the lake
in spring of youth it was my lot
to haunt of the wide world a spot
the which i could not love the less--
so lovely was the loneliness
of a wild lake, with black rock bound,
and the tall pines that towered around
but when the night had thrown her pall
upon the spot, as upon all,
and the mystic wind went by
murmuring in melody--
then--ah, then, i would awake
to the terror of the lone lake
yet that terror was not fright,
but a tremulous delight--
a feeling not the jewelled mine
could teach or bribe me to define--
nor love--although the love were thine
death was in that poisonous wave,
and in its gulf a fitting grave
for him who thence could solace bring
to his lone imagining--
whose solitary soul could make
an eden of that dim lake


evening star
twas noontide of summer,
and midtime of night,
and stars, in their orbits,
shone pale, through the light
of the brighter, cold moon
mid planets her slaves,
herself in the heavens,
her beam on the waves
i gazed awhile
on her cold smile
too cold--too cold for me--
there passed, as a shroud,
a fleecy cloud,
and i turned away to thee,
proud evening star,
in thy glory afar
and dearer thy beam shall be
for joy to my heart
is the proud part
thou bearest in heaven at night,
and more i admire
thy distant fire,
than that colder, lowly light


imitation
a dark unfathomed tide
of interminable pride--
a mystery, and a dream,
should my early life seem
i say that dream was fraught
with a wild and waking thought
of beings that have been,
which my spirit hath not seen,
had i let them pass me by,
with a dreaming eye
let none of earth inherit
that vision on my spirit
those thoughts i would control,
as a spell upon his soul
for that bright hope at last
and that light time have past,
and my wordly rest hath gone
with a sigh as it passed on
i care not though it perish
with a thought i then did cherish


the happiest day
i       the happiest day--the happiest hour
my seared and blighted heart hath known,
the highest hope of pride and power,
i feel hath flown
ii      of power said i? yes such i ween
but they have vanished long, alas
the visions of my youth have been--
but let them pass
iii     and pride, what have i now with thee?
another brow may evn inherit
the venom thou hast poured on me--
be still my spirit
iv      the happiest day--the happiest hour
mine eyes shall see--have ever seen
the brightest glance of pride and power
i feel have been
v       but were that hope of pride and power
now offered with the pain
evn then i felt--that brightest hour
i would not live again
vi      for on its wing was dark alloy
and as it fluttered--fell
an essence--powerful to destroy
a soul that knew it well


translation from the greek
hymn to aristogeiton and harmodius
i      wreathed in myrtle, my sword ill conceal,
like those champions devoted and brave,
when they plunged in the tyrant their steel,
and to athens deliverance gave
ii     beloved heroes your deathless souls roam
in the joy breathing isles of the blest
where the mighty of old have their home--
where achilles and diomed rest
iii    in fresh myrtle my blade ill entwine,
like harmodius, the gallant and good,
when he made at the tutelar shrine
a libation of tyrannys blood
iv     ye deliverers of athens from shame
ye avengers of libertys wrongs
endless ages shall cherish your fame,
embalmed in their echoing songs


dreams
oh that my young life were a lasting dream
my spirit not awakening, till the beam
of an eternity should bring the morrow
yes though that long dream were of hopeless sorrow,
twere better than the cold reality
of waking life, to him whose heart must be,
and hath been still, upon the lovely earth,
a chaos of deep passion, from his birth
but should it be--that dream eternally
continuing--as dreams have been to me
in my young boyhood--should it thus be given,
twere folly still to hope for higher heaven
for i have revelled when the sun was bright
i the summer sky, in dreams of living light
and loveliness,--have left my very heart
inclines of my imaginary apart
from mine own home, with beings that have been
of mine own thought--what more could i have seen?
twas once--and only once--and the wild hour
from my remembrance shall not pass--some power
or spell had bound me--twas the chilly wind
came oer me in the night, and left behind
its image on my spirit--or the moon
shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon
too coldly--or the stars--howeer it was
that dream was that that night-wind--let it pass
i have been happy, though in a dream
i have been happy--and i love the theme
dreams in their vivid coloring of life
as in that fleeting, shadowy, misty strife
of semblance with reality which brings
to the delirious eye, more lovely things
of paradise and love--and all my own--
than young hope in his sunniest hour hath known

in youth i have known one
how often we forget all time, when lone
admiring natures universal throne
her woods--her wilds--her mountains--the intense
reply of hers to our intelligence
i        in youth i have known one with whom the earth
in secret communing held--as he with it,
in daylight, and in beauty, from his birth
whose fervid, flickering torch of life was lit
from the sun and stars, whence he had drawn forth
a passionate light such for his spirit was fit--
and yet that spirit knew--not in the hour
of its own fervor--what had oer it power
ii       perhaps it may be that my mind is wrought
to a ferver  by the moonbeam that hangs oer,
but i will half believe that wild light fraught
with more of sovereignty than ancient lore
hath ever told--or is it of a thought
the unembodied essence, and no more
that with a quickening spell doth oer us pass
as dew of the night-time, oer the summer grass?
iii      doth oer us pass, when, as th expanding eye
to the loved object--so the tear to the lid
will start, which lately slept in apathy?
and yet it need not be--that object hid
from us in life--but common--which doth lie
each hour before us--but then only bid
with a strange sound, as of a harp-string broken
t awake us--tis a symbol and a token--
iv       of what in other worlds shall be--and given
in beauty by our god, to those alone
who otherwise would fall from life and heaven
drawn by their hearts passion, and that tone,
that high tone of the spirit which hath striven
though not with faith--with godliness--whose throne
with desperate energy t hath beaten down
wearing its own deep feeling as a crown

a pan
i        how shall the burial rite be read?
the solemn song be sung?
the requiem for the loveliest dead,
that ever died so young?
ii       her friends are gazing on her,
and on her gaudy bier,
and weep--oh to dishonor
dead beauty with a tear
iii     they loved her for her wealth--
and they hated her for her pride--
but she grew in feeble health,
and they love her--that she died
iv      they tell me while they speak
of her costly broiderd pall
that my voice is growing weak--
that i should not sing at all--
v       or that my tone should be
tund to such solemn song
so mournfully--so mournfully,
that the dead may feel no wrong
vi      but she is gone above,
with young hope at her side,
and i am drunk with love
of the dead, who is my bride--
vii     of the dead--dead who lies
all perfumd there,
with the death upon her eyes
and the life upon her hair
viii    thus on the coffin loud and long
i strike--the murmur sent
through the gray chambers to my song,
shall be the accompaniment
ix      thou diedst in thy lifes june--
but thou didst not die too fair
thou didst not die too soon,
nor with too calm an air
x       from more than friends on earth,
thy life and love are riven,
to join the untainted mirth
of more than thrones in heaven--
xi      therefore, to thee this night
i will no requiem raise,
but waft thee on thy flight,
with a pan of old days

mysterious star
thou wert my dream
all a long summer night--
be now my theme
by this clear stream,
of thee will i write
meantime from afar
bathe me in light
thy world has not the dross of ours,
yet all the beauty--all the flowers
that list our love or deck our bowers
in dreamy gardens, where do lie
dreamy maidens all the day
while the silver winds of circassy
on violet couches faint away
little--oh little dwells in thee
like unto what on earth we see
beautys eye is here the bluest
in the falsest and untruest--
on the sweetest air doth float
the most sad and solemn note--
if with thee be broken hearts,
joy so peacefully departs,
that its echo still doth dwell,
like the murmur in the shell
thou thy truest type of grief
is the gently falling leaf--
thou thy framing is so holy
sorrow is not melancholy

the earliest version of tamerlane was included in the suppressed
volume of , but differs very considerably from the poem as now
published the present draft, besides innumerable verbal alterations and
improvements upon the original, is more carefully punctuated, and, the
lines being indented, presents a more pleasing appearance, to the eye at
least

to helen first appeared in the  volume, as did also the
valley of unrest as the valley nis, israfel, and one or two
others of the youthful pieces
the poem styled romance constituted the preface of the  volume,
but with the addition of the following lines
succeeding years, too wild for song,
then rolled like tropic storms along,
where, though the garish lights that fly
dying along the troubled sky,
lay bare, through vistas thunder-riven,
the blackness of the general heaven,
that very blackness yet doth fling
light on the lightnings silver wing
for being an idle boy lang syne,
who read anacreon and drank wine,
i early found anacreon rhymes
were almost passionate sometimes--
and by strange alchemy of brain
his pleasures always turned to pain--
his navet to wild desire--
his wit to love--his wine to fire--
and so, being young and dipt in folly,
i fell in love with melancholy
and used to throw my earthly rest
and quiet all away in jest--
i could not love except where death
was mingling his with beautys breath--
or hymen, time, and destiny,
were stalking between her and me

but now my soul hath too much room--
gone are the glory and the gloom--
the black hath mellowd into gray,
and all the fires are fading away
my draught of passion hath been deep--
i revelld, and i now would sleep--
and after drunkenness of soul
succeeds the glories of the bowl--
an idle longing night and day
to dream my very life away
but dreams--of those who dream as i,
aspiringly, are damned, and die
yet should i swear i mean alone,
by notes so very shrilly blown,
to break upon times monotone,
while yet my vapid joy and grief
are tintless of the yellow leaf--
why not an imp the greybeard hath,
will shake his shadow in my path--
and een the greybeard will oerlook
connivingly my dreaming-book

doubtful poems

alone
from childhoods hour i have not been
as others were--i have not seen
as others saw--i could not bring
my passions from a common spring--
from the same source i have not taken
my sorrow--i could not awaken
my heart to joy at the same tone--
and all i loved--i loved alone--
thou--in my childhood--in the dawn
of a most stormy life--was drawn
from every depth of good and ill
the mystery which binds me still--
from the torrent, or the fountain--
from the red cliff of the mountain--
from the sun that round me rolld
in its autumn tint of gold--
from the lightning in the sky
as it passed me flying by--
from the thunder and the storm--
and the cloud that took the form
when the rest of heaven was blue
of a demon in my view
march ,

to isadore
i       beneath the vine-clad eaves,
whose shadows fall before
thy lowly cottage door--
under the lilacs tremulous leaves--
within thy snowy clasped hand
the purple flowers it bore
last eve in dreams, i saw thee stand,
like queenly nymph from fairy-land--
enchantress of the flowery wand,
most beauteous isadore
ii      and when i bade the dream
upon thy spirit flee,
thy violet eyes to me
upturned, did overflowing seem
with the deep, untold delight
of loves serenity
thy classic brow, like lilies white
and pale as the imperial night
upon her throne, with stars bedight,
enthralled my soul to thee
iii     ah ever i behold
thy dreamy, passionate eyes,
blue as the languid skies
hung with the sunsets fringe of gold
now strangely clear thine image grows,
and olden memories
are startled from their long repose
like shadows on the silent snows
when suddenly the night-wind blows
where quiet moonlight lies
iv      like music heard in dreams,
like strains of harps unknown,
of birds for ever flown,--
audible as the voice of streams
that murmur in some leafy dell,
i hear thy gentlest tone,
and silence cometh with her spell
like that which on my tongue doth dwell,
when tremulous in dreams i tell
my love to thee alone
v       in every valley heard,
floating from tree to tree,
less beautiful to me,
the music of the radiant bird,
than artless accents such as thine
whose echoes never flee
ah how for thy sweet voice i pine--
for uttered in thy tones benign
enchantress this rude name of mine
doth seem a melody

the village street
in these rapid, restless shadows,
once i walked at eventide,
when a gentle, silent maiden,
walked in beauty at my side
she alone there walked beside me
all in beauty, like a bride
pallidly the moon was shining
on the dewy meadows nigh
on the silvery, silent rivers,
on the mountains far and high,--
on the oceans star-lit waters,
where the winds a-weary die
slowly, silently we wandered
from the open cottage door,
underneath the elms long branches
to the pavement bending oer
underneath the mossy willow
and the dying sycamore
with the myriad stars in beauty
all bedight, the heavens were seen,
radiant hopes were bright around me,
like the light of stars serene
like the mellow midnight splendor
of the nights irradiate queen
audibly the elm-leaves whispered
peaceful, pleasant melodies,
like the distant murmured music
of unquiet, lovely seas
while the winds were hushed in slumber
in the fragrant flowers and trees
wondrous and unwonted beauty
still adorning all did seem,
while i told my love in fables
neath the willows by the stream
would the heart have kept unspoken
love that was its rarest dream
instantly away we wandered
in the shadowy twilight tide,
she, the silent, scornful maiden,
walking calmly at my side,
with a step serene and stately,
all in beauty, all in pride
vacantly i walked beside her
on the earth mine eyes were cast
swift and keen there came unto me
bitter memories of the past--
on me, like the rain in autumn
on the dead leaves, cold and fast
underneath the elms we parted,
by the lowly cottage door
one brief word alone was uttered--
never on our lips before
and away i walked forlornly,
broken-hearted evermore
slowly, silently i loitered,
homeward, in the night, alone
sudden anguish bound my spirit,
that my youth had never known
wild unrest, like that which cometh
when the nights first dream hath flown
now, to me the elm-leaves whisper
mad, discordant melodies,
and keen melodies like shadows
haunt the moaning willow trees,
and the sycamores with laughter
mock me in the nightly breeze
sad and pale the autumn moonlight
through the sighing foliage streams
and each morning, midnight shadow,
shadow of my sorrow seems
strive, o heart, forget thine idol
and, o soul, forget thy dreams

the forest reverie
tis said that when
the hands of men
tamed this primeval wood,
and hoary trees with groans of wo,
like warriors by an unknown foe,
were in their strength subdued,
the virgin earth
gave instant birth
to springs that neer did flow--
that in the sun
did rivulets run,
and all around rare flowers did blow--
the wild rose pale
perfumed the gale,
and the queenly lily adown the dale
whom the sun and the dew
and the winds did woo,
with the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew
so when in tears
the love of years
is wasted like the snow,
and the fine fibrils of its life
by the rude wrong of instant strife
are broken at a blow--
within the heart
do springs upstart
of which it doth now know,
and strange, sweet dreams,
like silent streams
that from new fountains overflow,
with the earlier tide
of rivers glide
deep in the heart whose hope has died--
quenching the fires its ashes hide,--
its ashes, whence will spring and grow
sweet flowers, ere long,--
the rare and radiant flowers of song

la musique, says marmontel, in those contes moraux which in all
our translations we have insisted upon calling moral tales, as if in
mockery of their spirit--la musique est le seul des talens qui jouisse
de lui-meme tous les autres veulent des temoins he here confounds
the pleasure derivable from sweet sounds with the capacity for creating
them no more than any other talent, is that for music susceptible of
complete enjoyment where there is no second party to appreciate its
exercise and it is only in common with other talents that it produces
effects which may be fully enjoyed in solitude the idea which the
raconteur has either failed to entertain clearly, or has sacrificed in
its expression to his national love of point, is doubtless the very
tenable one that the higher order of music is the most thoroughly
estimated when we are exclusively alone the proposition in this form
will be admitted at once by those who love the lyre for its own sake and
for its spiritual uses but there is one pleasure still within the reach
of fallen mortality, and perhaps only one, which owes even more than
does music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion i mean the happiness
experienced in the contemplation of natural scenery in truth, the man
who would behold aright the glory of god upon earth must in solitude
behold that glory to me at least the presence, not of human life only,
but of life, in any other form than that of the green things which grow
upon the soil and are voiceless, is a stain upon the landscape, is at
war with the genius of the scene i love, indeed, to regard the dark
valleys, and the gray rocks, and the waters that silently smile, and the
forests that sigh in uneasy slumbers, and the proud watchful mountains
that look down upon all,--i love to regard these as themselves but the
colossal members of one vast animate and sentient whole--a whole whose
form that of the sphere is the most perfect and most inclusive of all
whose path is among associate planets whose meek handmaiden is the
moon whose mediate sovereign is the sun whose life is eternity whose
thought is that of a god whose enjoyment is knowledge whose destinies
are lost in immensity whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our
own cognizance of the animalcul which infest the brain, a being which
we in consequence regard as purely inanimate and material, much in the
same manner as these animalcul must thus regard us
our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on every
hand, notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the priesthood,
that space, and therefore that bulk, is an important consideration in
the eyes of the almighty the cycles in which the stars move are those
best adapted for the evolution, without collision, of the greatest
possible number of bodies the forms of those bodies are accurately such
as within a given surface to include the greatest possible amount of
matter while the surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodate
a denser population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces
otherwise arranged nor is it any argument against bulk being an object
with god that space itself is infinite for there may be an infinity of
matter to fill it and since we see clearly that the endowment of matter
with vitality is a principle--indeed, as far as our judgments extend,
the leading principle in the operations of deity, it is scarcely
logical to imagine it confined to the regions of the minute, where we
daily trace it, and not extending to those of the august as we find
cycle within cycle without end, yet all revolving around one far-distant
centre which is the godhead, may we not analogically suppose, in the
same manner, life within life, the less within the greater, and all
within the spirit divine? in short, we are madly erring through
self-esteem in believing man, in either his temporal or future
destinies, to be of more moment in the universe than that vast clod of
the valley which he tills and contemns, and to which he denies a soul,
for no more profound reason than that he does not behold it in operation

these fancies, and such as these, have always given to my meditations
among the mountains and the forests, by the rivers and the ocean, a
tinge of what the every-day world would not fail to term the fantastic
my wanderings amid such scenes have been many and far-searching, and
often solitary and the interest with which i have strayed through many
a dim deep valley, or gazed into the reflected heaven of many a bright
lake, has been an interest greatly deepened by the thought that i have
strayed and gazed alone what flippant frenchman  was it who said,
in allusion to the well known work of zimmermann, that la solitude est
une belle chose mais il faut quelquun pour vous dire que la solitude
est une belle chose? the epigram cannot be gainsaid but the necessity
is a thing that does not exist
it was during one of my lonely journeyings, amid a far distant region of
mountain locked within mountain, and sad rivers and melancholy tarns
writhing or sleeping within all, that i chanced upon a certain rivulet
and island i came upon them suddenly in the leafy june, and threw
myself upon the turf beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub,
that i might doze as i contemplated the scene i felt that thus only
should i look upon it, such was the character of phantasm which it wore
on all sides, save to the west where the sun was about sinking, arose
the verdant walls of the forest the little river which turned sharply
in its course, and was thus immediately lost to sight, seemed to have no
exit from its prison, but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage of
the trees to the east while in the opposite quarter so it appeared to
me as i lay at length and glanced upward there poured down noiselessly
and continuously into the valley a rich golden and crimson waterfall
from the sunset fountains of the sky
about midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in, one
small circular island, profusely verdured, reposed upon the bosom of the
stream
so blended bank and shadow there,
that each seemed pendulous in air--
so mirror-like was the glassy water, that it was scarcely possible to
say at what point upon the slope of the emerald turf its crystal
dominion began my position enabled me to include in a single view both
the eastern and western extremities of the islet, and i observed a
singularly-marked difference in their aspects the latter was all one
radiant harem of garden beauties it glowed and blushed beneath the eye
of the slant sunlight, and fairly laughed with flowers the grass was
short, springy, sweet-scented, and asphodel-interspersed the trees were
lithe, mirthful, erect, bright, slender, and graceful, of eastern figure
and foliage, with bark smooth, glossy, and parti-colored there seemed a
deep sense of life and joy about all, and although no airs blew from out
the heavens, yet everything had motion through the gentle sweepings to
and fro of innumerable butterflies, that might have been mistaken for
tulips with wings
the other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest shade
a sombre, yet beautiful and peaceful gloom, here pervaded all things
the trees were dark in color and mournful in form and attitude--
wreathing themselves into sad, solemn, and spectral shapes, that
conveyed ideas of mortal sorrow and untimely death the grass wore the
deep tint of the cypress, and the heads of its blades hung droopingly,
and hither and thither among it were many small unsightly hillocks, low
and narrow, and not very long, that had the aspect of graves, but were
not, although over and all about them the rue and the rosemary
clambered the shades of the trees fell heavily upon the water, and
seemed to bury itself therein, impregnating the depths of the element
with darkness i fancied that each shadow, as the sun descended lower
and lower, separated itself sullenly from the trunk that gave it birth,
and thus became absorbed by the stream, while other shadows issued
momently from the trees, taking the place of their predecessors thus
entombed
this idea having once seized upon my fancy greatly excited it, and i
lost myself forthwith in reverie if ever island were enchanted, said
i to myself, this is it this is the haunt of the few gentle fays who
remain from the wreck of the race are these green tombs theirs?--or do
they yield up their sweet lives as mankind yield up their own? in dying,
do they not rather waste away mournfully, rendering unto god little by
little their existence, as these trees render up shadow after shadow,
exhausting their substance unto dissolution? what the wasting tree is to
the water that imbibes its shade, growing thus blacker by what it preys
upon, may not the life of the fay be to the death which engulfs it?
as i thus mused, with half-shut eyes, while the sun sank rapidly to
rest, and eddying currents careered round and round the island, bearing
upon their bosom large dazzling white flakes of the bark of the
sycamore, flakes which, in their multiform positions upon the water, a
quick imagination might have converted into anything it pleased while i
thus mused, it appeared to me that the form of one of those very fays
about whom i had been pondering, made its way slowly into the darkness
from out the light at the western end of the island she stood erect in
a singularly fragile canoe, and urged it with the mere phantom of an
oar while within the influence of the lingering sunbeams, her attitude
seemed indicative of joy, but sorrow deformed it as she passed within
the shade slowly she glided along, and at length rounded the islet and
re-entered the region of light the revolution which has just been made
by the fay, continued i musingly, is the cycle of the brief year of
her life she has floated through her winter and through her summer she
is a year nearer unto death for i did not fail to see that as she came
into the shade, her shadow fell from her, and was swallowed up in the
dark water, making its blackness more black
and again the boat appeared and the fay, but about the attitude of the
latter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic joy
she floated again from out the light and into the gloom which deepened
momently, and again her shadow fell from her into the ebony water, and
became absorbed into its blackness and again and again she made the
circuit of the island while the sun rushed down to his slumbers, and
at each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person,
while it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct, and at each
passage into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade, which became
whelmed in a shadow more black but at length, when the sun had utterly
departed, the fay, now the mere ghost of her former self, went
disconsolately with her boat into the region of the ebony flood, and
that she issued thence at all i cannot say, for darkness fell over all
things, and i beheld her magical figure no more

the power of words
oinos
pardon, agathos, the weakness of a spirit new-fledged with
immortality
agathos
you have spoken nothing, my oinos, for which pardon is to be demanded
not even here is knowledge a thing of intuition for wisdom, ask of
the angels freely, that it may be given
oinos
but in this existence i dreamed that i should be at once cognizant of
all things, and thus at once happy in being cognizant of all
agathos
ah, not in knowledge is happiness, but in the acquisition of
knowledge in forever knowing, we are forever blessed but to know
all, were the curse of a fiend
oinos
but does not the most high know all?
agathos
that since he is the most happy must be still the one thing
unknown even to him
oinos
but, since we grow hourly in knowledge, must not at last all things
be known?
agathos
look down into the abysmal distances--attempt to force the gaze down
the multitudinous vistas of the stars, as we sweep slowly through them
thus--and thus--and thus even the spiritual vision, is it not at all
points arrested by the continuous golden walls of the universe?--the
walls of the myriads of the shining bodies that mere number has
appeared to blend into unity?
oinos
i clearly perceive that the infinity of matter is no dream
agathos
there are no dreams in aidenn--but it is here whispered that, of this
infinity of matter, the sole purpose is to afford infinite springs
at which the soul may allay the thirst to know which is forever
unquenchable within it--since to quench it would be to extinguish the
souls self question me then, my oinos, freely and without fear
come we will leave to the left the loud harmony of the pleiades, and
swoop outward from the throne into the starry meadows beyond orion,
where, for pansies and violets, and hearts-ease, are the beds of the
triplicate and triple-tinted suns
oinos
and now, agathos, as we proceed, instruct me--speak to me in the
earths familiar tones i understand not what you hinted to me just
now of the modes or of the methods of what during mortality, we were
accustomed to call creation do you mean to say that the creator is
not god?
agathos
i mean to say that the deity does not create
oinos
explain
agathos
in the beginning only, he created the seeming creatures which are now
throughout the universe so perpetually springing into being can only
be considered as the mediate or indirect, not as the direct or
immediate results of the divine creative power
oinos
among men, my agathos, this idea would be considered heretical in the
extreme
agathos
among the angels, my oinos, it is seen to be simply true
oinos
i can comprehend you thus far--that certain operations of what we term
nature, or the natural laws, will, under certain conditions, give rise
to that which has all the appearance of creation shortly before the
final overthrow of the earth, there were, i well remember, many very
successful experiments in what some philosophers were weak enough to
denominate the creation of animalcul
agathos
the cases of which you speak were, in fact, instances of the secondary
creation, and of the only species of creation which has ever been
since the first word spoke into existence the first law
oinos
are not the starry worlds that, from the abyss of nonentity, burst
hourly forth into the heavens--are not these stars, agathos, the
immediate handiwork of the king?
agathos
let me endeavor, my oinos, to lead you, step by step, to the
conception i intend you are well aware that, as no thought can
perish, so no act is without infinite result we moved our hands, for
example, when we were dwellers on the earth, and in so doing we gave
vibration to the atmosphere which engirdled it this vibration was
indefinitely extended till it gave impulse to every particle of the
earths air, which thenceforward, and forever, was actuated by the
one movement of the hand this fact the mathematicians of our globe
well knew they made the special effects, indeed, wrought in the fluid
by special impulses, the subject of exact calculation--so that it
became easy to determine in what precise period an impulse of given
extent would engirdle the orb, and impress forever every atom of the
atmosphere circumambient retrograding, they found no difficulty from
a given effect, under given conditions, in determining the value of
the original impulse now the mathematicians who saw that the results
of any given impulse were absolutely endless--and who saw that a
portion of these results were accurately traceable through the agency
of algebraic analysis--who saw, too, the facility of the
retrogradation--these men saw, at the same time, that this species of
analysis itself had within itself a capacity for indefinite
progress--that there were no bounds conceivable to its advancement and
applicability, except within the intellect of him who advanced or
applied it but at this point our mathematicians paused
oinos
and why, agathos, should they have proceeded?
agathos
because there were some considerations of deep interest beyond it was
deducible from what they knew, that to a being of infinite
understanding--one to whom the perfection of the algebraic analysis
lay unfolded--there could be no difficulty in tracing every impulse
given the air--and the ether through the air--to the remotest
consequences at any even infinitely remote epoch of time it is indeed
demonstrable that every such impulse given the air, must in the
end impress every individual thing that exists within the
universe--and the being of infinite understanding--the being whom
we have imagined--might trace the remote undulations of the
impulse--trace them upward and onward in their influences upon all
particles of all matter--upward and onward forever in their
modifications of old forms--or, in other words, in their creation of
new--until he found them reflected--unimpressive at last--back from
the throne of the godhead and not only could such a being do this,
but at any epoch, should a given result be afforded him--should one of
these numberless comets, for example, be presented to his
inspection--he could have no difficulty in determining, by the
analytic retrogradation, to what original impulse it was due this
power of retrogradation in its absolute fulness and perfection--this
faculty of referring at all epochs, all effects to all
causes--is of course the prerogative of the deity alone--but in every
variety of degree, short of the absolute perfection, is the power
itself exercised by the whole host of the angelic intelligences
oinos
but you speak merely of impulses upon the air
agathos
in speaking of the air, i referred only to the earth but the general
proposition has reference to impulses upon the ether--which, since it
pervades, and alone pervades all space, is thus the great medium of
creation
oinos
then all motion, of whatever nature, creates?
agathos
it must but a true philosophy has long taught that the source of all
motion is thought--and the source of all thought is--
oinos
god
agathos
i have spoken to you, oinos, as to a child, of the fair earth which
lately perished--of impulses upon the atmosphere of the earth
oinos
you did
agathos
and while i thus spoke, did there not cross your mind some thought of
the physical power of words? is not every word an impulse on the
air?
oinos
but why, agathos, do you weep--and why, oh, why do your wings droop as
we hover above this fair star--which is the greenest and yet most
terrible of all we have encountered in our flight? its brilliant
flowers look like a fairy dream--but its fierce volcanoes like the
passions of a turbulent heart
agathos
they are--they are--this wild star--it is now three centuries
since, with clasped hands, and with streaming eyes, at the feet of my
beloved--i spoke it--with a few passionate sentences--into birth its
brilliant flowers are the dearest of all unfulfilled dreams, and its
raging volcanoes are the passions of the most turbulent and
unhallowed of hearts

the colloquy of monos and una
greek mellonta  sauta
these things are in the future
sophocles--antig
una
born again?
monos
yes, fairest and best beloved una, born again these were the words
upon whose mystical meaning i had so long pondered, rejecting the
explanations of the priesthood, until death itself resolved for me the
secret
una
death
monos
how strangely, sweet una, you echo my words i observe, too, a
vacillation in your step, a joyous inquietude in your eyes you are
confused and oppressed by the majestic novelty of the life eternal
yes, it was of death i spoke and here how singularly sounds that word
which of old was wont to bring terror to all hearts, throwing a mildew
upon all pleasures
una
ah, death, the spectre which sate at all feasts how often, monos, did
we lose ourselves in speculations upon its nature how mysteriously
did it act as a check to human bliss, saying unto it, thus far, and
no farther that earnest mutual love, my own monos, which burned
within our bosoms, how vainly did we flatter ourselves, feeling happy
in its first upspringing that our happiness would strengthen with its
strength alas, as it grew, so grew in our hearts the dread of that
evil hour which was hurrying to separate us forever thus in time it
became painful to love hate would have been mercy then
monos
speak not here of these griefs, dear una--mine, mine forever now
una
but the memory of past sorrow, is it not present joy? i have much to
say yet of the things which have been above all, i burn to know the
incidents of your own passage through the dark valley and shadow
monos
and when did the radiant una ask anything of her monos in vain? i will
be minute in relating all, but at what point shall the weird narrative
begin?
una
at what point?
monos
you have said
una
monos, i comprehend you in death we have both learned the propensity
of man to define the indefinable i will not say, then, commence with
the moment of lifes cessation--but commence with that sad, sad
instant when, the fever having abandoned you, you sank into a
breathless and motionless torpor, and i pressed down your pallid
eyelids with the passionate fingers of love
monos
one word first, my una, in regard to mans general condition at this
epoch you will remember that one or two of the wise among our
forefathers--wise in fact, although not in the worlds esteem--had
ventured to doubt the propriety of the term improvement, as applied
to the progress of our civilization there were periods in each of the
five or six centuries immediately preceding our dissolution when arose
some vigorous intellect, boldly contending for those principles whose
truth appears now, to our disenfranchised reason, so utterly obvious
--principles which should have taught our race to submit to the
guidance of the natural laws rather than attempt their control at
long intervals some master-minds appeared, looking upon each advance
in practical science as a retrogradation in the true utility
occasionally the poetic intellect--that intellect which we now feel to
have been the most exalted of all--since those truths which to us were
of the most enduring importance could only be reached by that
analogy which speaks in proof-tones to the imagination alone, and to
the unaided reason bears no weight--occasionally did this poetic
intellect proceed a step farther in the evolving of the vague idea of
the philosophic, and find in the mystic parable that tells of the tree
of knowledge, and of its forbidden fruit, death-producing, a distinct
intimation that knowledge was not meet for man in the infant condition
of his soul and these men--the poets--living and perishing amid the
scorn of the utilitarians--of rough pedants, who arrogated to
themselves a title which could have been properly applied only to the
scorned--these men, the poets, pondered piningly, yet not unwisely,
upon the ancient days when our wants were not more simple than our
enjoyments were keen--days when mirth was a word unknown, so
solemnly deep-toned was happiness--holy, august, and blissful days,
blue rivers ran undammed, between hills unhewn, into far forest
solitudes, primeval, odorous, and unexplored yet these noble
exceptions from the general misrule served but to strengthen it by
opposition alas we had fallen upon the most evil of all our evil
days the great movement--that was the cant term--went on a
diseased commotion, moral and physical art--the arts--arose supreme,
and once enthroned, cast chains upon the intellect which had elevated
them to power man, because he could not but acknowledge the majesty
of nature, fell into childish exultation at his acquired and
still-increasing dominion over her elements even while he stalked a
god in his own fancy, an infantine imbecility came over him as might
be supposed from the origin of his disorder, he grew infected with
system, and with abstraction he enwrapped himself in generalities
among other odd ideas, that of universal equality gained ground and
in the face of analogy and of god--in despite of the loud warning
voice of the laws of gradation so visibly pervading all things in
earth and heaven--wild attempts at an omniprevalent democracy were
made yet this evil sprang necessarily from the leading evil,
knowledge man could not both know and succumb meantime huge smoking
cities arose, innumerable green leaves shrank before the hot breath
of furnaces the fair face of nature was deformed as with the ravages
of some loathsome disease and methinks, sweet una, even our
slumbering sense of the forced and of the far-fetched might have
arrested us here but now it appears that we had worked out our own
destruction in the perversion of our taste, or rather in the blind
neglect of its culture in the schools for, in truth, it was at this
crisis that taste alone--that faculty which, holding a middle position
between the pure intellect and the moral sense, could never safely
have been disregarded--it was now that taste alone could have led us
gently back to beauty, to nature, and to life but alas for the pure
contemplative spirit and majestic intuition of plato alas for the
greek mousichae  which he justly regarded as an all-sufficient
education for the soul alas for him and for it--since both were most
desperately needed, when both were most entirely forgotten or despised
pascal, a philosopher whom we both love, has said, how
truly--que tout notre raisonnement se rduit  cder au
sentiment and it is not impossible that the sentiment of the
natural, had time permitted it, would have regained its old ascendency
over the harsh mathematical reason of the schools but this thing was
not to be prematurely induced by intemperance of knowledge, the old
age of the world drew near this the mass of mankind saw not, or,
living lustily although unhappily, affected not to see but, for
myself, the earths records had taught me to look for widest ruin as
the price of highest civilization i had imbibed a prescience of our
fate from comparison of china the simple and enduring, with assyria
the architect, with egypt the astrologer, with nubia, more crafty than
either, the turbulent mother of all arts in the history of these
regions i met with a ray from the future the individual
artificialities of the three latter were local diseases of the earth,
and in their individual overthrows we had seen local remedies applied
but for the infected world at large i could anticipate no regeneration
save in death that man, as a race, should not become extinct, i saw
that he must be born again
and now it was, fairest and dearest, that we wrapped our spirits,
daily, in dreams now it was that, in twilight, we discoursed of the
days to come, when the art-scarred surface of the earth, having
undergone that purification which alone could efface its rectangular
obscenities, should clothe itself anew in the verdure and the
mountain-slopes and the smiling waters of paradise, and be rendered at
length a fit dwelling-place for man--for man the death-purged--for
man to whose now exalted intellect there should be poison in knowledge
no more--for the redeemed, regenerated, blissful, and now immortal,
but still for the material, man
una
well do i remember these conversations, dear monos but the epoch of
the fiery overthrow was not so near at hand as we believed, and as the
corruption you indicate did surely warrant us in believing men lived
and died individually you yourself sickened, and passed into the
grave and thither your constant una speedily followed you and though
the century which has since elapsed, and whose conclusion brings up
together once more, tortured our slumbering senses with no impatience
of duration, yet my monos, it was a century still
monos
say, rather, a point in the vague infinity unquestionably, it was in
the earths dotage that i died wearied at heart with anxieties which
had their origin in the general turmoil and decay, i succumbed to the
fierce fever after some few days of pain, and many of dreamy delirium
replete with ecstasy, the manifestations of which you mistook for
pain, while i longed but was impotent to undeceive you--after some
days there came upon me, as you have said, a breathless and motionless
torpor and this was termed death by those who stood around me
words are vague things my condition did not deprive me of sentience
it appeared to me not greatly dissimilar to the extreme quiescence of
him, who, having slumbered long and profoundly, lying motionless and
fully prostrate in a mid-summer noon, begins to steal slowly back into
consciousness, through the mere sufficiency of his sleep, and without
being awakened by external disturbances
i breathed no longer the pulses were still the heart had ceased to
beat volition had not departed, but was powerless the senses were
unusually active, although eccentrically so--assuming often each
others functions at random the taste and the smell were inextricably
confounded, and became one sentiment, abnormal and intense the
rose-water with which your tenderness had moistened my lips to the
last, affected me with sweet fancies of flowers--fantastic flowers,
far more lovely than any of the old earth, but whose prototypes we
have here blooming around us the eye-lids, transparent and bloodless,
offered no complete impediment to vision as volition was in abeyance,
the balls could not roll in their sockets--but all objects within the
range of the visual hemisphere were seen with more or less
distinctness the rays which fell upon the external retina, or into
the corner of the eye, producing a more vivid effect than those which
struck the front or interior surface yet, in the former instance,
this effect was so far anomalous that i appreciated it only as
sound--sound sweet or discordant as the matters presenting
themselves at my side were light or dark in shade--curved or angular
in outline the hearing, at the same time, although excited in degree,
was not irregular in action--estimating real sounds with an
extravagance of precision, not less than of sensibility touch had
undergone a modification more peculiar its impressions were tardily
received, but pertinaciously retained, and resulted always in the
highest physical pleasure thus the pressure of your sweet fingers
upon my eyelids, at first only recognized through vision, at length,
long after their removal, filled my whole being with a sensual delight
immeasurable i say with a sensual delight all my perceptions were
purely sensual the materials furnished the passive brain by the
senses were not in the least degree wrought into shape by the deceased
understanding of pain there was some little of pleasure there was
much but of moral pain or pleasure none at all thus your wild sobs
floated into my ear with all their mournful cadences, and were
appreciated in their every variation of sad tone but they were soft
musical sounds and no more they conveyed to the extinct reason no
intimation of the sorrows which gave them birth while large and
constant tears which fell upon my face, telling the bystanders of a
heart which broke, thrilled every fibre of my frame with ecstasy
alone and this was in truth the death of which these bystanders
spoke reverently, in low whispers--you, sweet una, gaspingly, with
loud cries
they attired me for the coffin--three or four dark figures which
flitted busily to and fro as these crossed the direct line of my
vision they affected me as forms but upon passing to my side their
images impressed me with the idea of shrieks, groans, and, other
dismal expressions of terror, of horror, or of woe you alone, habited
in a white robe, passed in all directions musically about
the day waned and, as its light faded away, i became possessed by a
vague uneasiness--an anxiety such as the sleeper feels when sad real
sounds fall continuously within his ear--low distant bell-tones,
solemn, at long but equal intervals, and commingling with melancholy
dreams night arrived and with its shadows a heavy discomfort it
oppressed my limbs with the oppression of some dull weight, and was
palpable there was also a moaning sound, not unlike the distant
reverberation of surf, but more continuous, which, beginning with the
first twilight, had grown in strength with the darkness suddenly
lights were brought into the rooms, and this reverberation became
forthwith interrupted into frequent unequal bursts of the same sound,
but less dreary and less distinct the ponderous oppression was in a
great measure relieved and, issuing from the flame of each lamp for
there were many, there flowed unbrokenly into my ears a strain of
melodious monotone and when now, dear una, approaching the bed upon
which i lay outstretched, you sat gently by my side, breathing odor
from your sweet lips, and pressing them upon my brow, there arose
tremulously within my bosom, and mingling with the merely physical
sensations which circumstances had called forth, a something akin to
sentiment itself--a feeling that, half appreciating, half responded
to your earnest love and sorrow but this feeling took no root in the
pulseless heart, and seemed indeed rather a shadow than a reality, and
faded quickly away, first into extreme quiescence, and then into a
purely sensual pleasure as before
and now, from the wreck and the chaos of the usual senses, there
appeared to have arisen within me a sixth, all perfect in its
exercise i found a wild delight--yet a delight still physical,
inasmuch as the understanding had in it no part motion in the animal
frame had fully ceased no muscle quivered no nerve thrilled no
artery throbbed but there seemed to have sprung up in the brain
that of which no words could convey to the merely human intelligence
even an indistinct conception let me term it a mental pendulous
pulsation it was the moral embodiment of mans abstract idea of
time by the absolute equalization of this movement--or of such as
this--had the cycles of the firmamental orbs themselves been adjusted
by its aid i measured the irregularities of the clock upon the mantel,
and of the watches of the attendants their tickings came sonorously
to my ears the slightest deviations from the true proportion--and
these deviations were omniprevalent--affected me just as violations of
abstract truth were wont on earth to affect the moral sense although
no two of the timepieces in the chamber struck the individual seconds
accurately together, yet i had no difficulty in holding steadily in
mind the tones, and the respective momentary errors of each and
this--this keen, perfect self-existing sentiment of duration--this
sentiment existing as man could not possibly have conceived it to
exist independently of any succession of events--this idea--this
sixth sense, upspringing from the ashes of the rest, was the first
obvious and certain step of the intemporal soul upon the threshold of
the temporal eternity
it was midnight and you still sat by my side all others had departed
from the chamber of death they had deposited me in the coffin the
lamps burned flickeringly for this i knew by the tremulousness of the
monotonous strains but suddenly these strains diminished in
distinctness and in volume finally they ceased the perfume in my
nostrils died away forms affected my vision no longer the oppression
of the darkness uplifted itself from my bosom a dull shot like that
of electricity pervaded my frame, and was followed by total loss of
the idea of contact all of what man has termed sense was merged in
the sole consciousness of entity, and in the one abiding sentiment of
duration the mortal body had been at length stricken with the hand of
the deadly decay
yet had not all of sentience departed for the consciousness and the
sentiment remaining supplied some of its functions by a lethargic
intuition i appreciated the direful change now in operation upon the
flesh, and, as the dreamer is sometimes aware of the bodily presence
of one who leans over him, so, sweet una, i still dully felt that you
sat by my side so, too, when the noon of the second day came, i was
not unconscious of those movements which displaced you from my side,
which confined me within the coffin, which deposited me within the
hearse, which bore me to the grave, which lowered me within it, which
heaped heavily the mould upon me, and which thus left me, in blackness
and corruption, to my sad and solemn slumbers with the worm
and here in the prison-house which has few secrets to disclose, there
rolled away days and weeks and months and the soul watched narrowly
each second as it flew, and, without effort, took record of its
flight--without effort and without object
a year passed the consciousness of being had grown hourly more
indistinct, and that of mere locality had in great measure usurped
its position the idea of entity was becoming merged in that of
place the narrow space immediately surrounding what had been the
body was now growing to be the body itself at length, as often
happens to the sleeper by sleep and its world alone is death
imaged--at length, as sometimes happened on earth to the deep
slumberer, when some flitting light half startled him into awaking,
yet left him half enveloped in dreams--so to me, in the strict embrace
of the shadow, came that light which alone might have had power to
startle--the light of enduring love men toiled at the grave in
which i lay darkling they upthrew the damp earth upon my mouldering
bones there descended the coffin of una and now again all was void
that nebulous light had been extinguished that feeble thrill had
vibrated itself into quiescence many lustra had supervened dust
had returned to dust the worm had food no more the sense of being
had at length utterly departed, and there reigned in its stead--
instead of all things, dominant and perpetual--the autocrats place
and time for that which was not--for that which had no
form--for that which had no thought--for that which had no
sentience--for that which was soundless, yet of which matter formed no
portion--for all this nothingness, yet for all this immortality, the
grave was still a home, and the corrosive hours, co-mates

the conversation of eiros and charmion
i will bring fire to thee
euripides--androm
eiros
why do you call me eiros?
charmion
so henceforward will you always be called you must forget, too, my
earthly name, and speak to me as charmion
eiros
this is indeed no dream
charmion
dreams are with us no more--but of these mysteries anon i rejoice to
see you looking life-like and rational the film of the shadow has
already passed from off your eyes be of heart, and fear nothing your
allotted days of stupor have expired, and to-morrow i will myself
induct you into the full joys and wonders of your novel existence
eiros
true--i feel no stupor--none at all the wild sickness and the
terrible darkness have left me, and i hear no longer that mad,
rushing, horrible sound, like the voice of many waters yet my
senses are bewildered, charmion, with the keenness of their perception
of the new
charmion
a few days will remove all this--but i fully understand you, and
feel for you it is now ten earthly years since i underwent what you
undergo--yet the remembrance of it hangs by me still you have now
suffered all of pain, however, which you will suffer in aidenn
eiros
in aidenn?
charmion
in aidenn
eiros
o god--pity me, charmion--i am overburthened with the majesty of all
things--of the unknown now known--of the speculative future merged in
the august and certain present
charmion
grapple not now with such thoughts to-morrow we will speak of this
your mind wavers, and its agitation will find relief in the exercise
of simple memories look not around, nor forward--but back i am
burning with anxiety to hear the details of that stupendous event
which threw you among us tell me of it let us converse of familiar
things, in the old familiar language of the world which has so
fearfully perished
eiros
most fearfully, fearfully--this is indeed no dream
charmion
dreams are no more was i much mourned, my eiros?
eiros
mourned, charmion?--oh, deeply to that last hour of all there hung a
cloud of intense gloom and devout sorrow over your household
charmion
and that last hour--speak of it remember that, beyond the naked fact
of the catastrophe itself, i know nothing when, coming out from among
mankind, i passed into night through the grave--at that period, if i
remember aright, the calamity which overwhelmed you was utterly
unanticipated but, indeed, i knew little of the speculative
philosophy of the day
eiros
the individual calamity was, as you say, entirely unanticipated but
analogous misfortunes had been long a subject of discussion with
astronomers i need scarce tell you, my friend, that, even when you
left us, men had agreed to understand those passages in the most holy
writings which speak of the final destruction of all things by fire as
having reference to the orb of the earth alone, but in regard to the
immediate agency of the ruin, speculation had been at fault from that
epoch in astronomical knowledge in which the comets were divested of
the terrors of flame the very moderate density of these bodies had
been well established they had been observed to pass among the
satellites of jupiter without bringing about any sensible alteration
either in the masses or in the orbits of these secondary planets we
had long regarded the wanderers as vapory creations of inconceivable
tenuity, and as altogether incapable of doing injury to our
substantial globe, even in the event of contact but contact was not
in any degree dreaded for the elements of all the comets were
accurately known that among them we should look for the agency of
the threatened fiery destruction had been for many years considered an
inadmissible idea but wonders and wild fancies had been of late days
strangely rife among mankind and, although it was only with a few of
the ignorant that actual apprehension prevailed, upon the announcement
by astronomers of a new comet, yet this announcement was generally
received with i know not what of agitation and mistrust
the elements of the strange orb were immediately calculated, and it
was at once conceded by all observers that its path, at perihelion
would bring it into very close proximity with the earth there were
two or three astronomers of secondary note who resolutely maintained
that a contact was inevitable i cannot very well express to you the
effect of this intelligence upon the people for a few short days they
would not believe an assertion which their intellect, so long employed
among worldly considerations, could not in any manner grasp but the
truth of a vitally important fact soon makes its way into the
understanding of even the most stolid finally, all men saw that
astronomical knowledge lies not, and they awaited the comet its
approach was not at first seemingly rapid, nor was its appearance of
very unusual character it was of a dull red, and had little
perceptible train for seven or eight days we saw no material increase
in its apparent diameter, and but a partial alteration in its color
meantime, the ordinary affairs of men were discarded, and all interest
absorbed in a growing discussion instituted by the philosophic in
respect to the cometary nature even the grossly ignorant aroused
their sluggish capacities to such considerations the learned now
gave their intellect--their soul--to no such points as the allaying of
fear, or to the sustenance of loved theory they sought--they panted
for right views they groaned for perfected knowledge truth arose
in the purity of her strength and exceeding majesty, and the wise
bowed down and adored
that material injury to our globe or to its inhabitants would result
from the apprehended contact was an opinion which hourly lost ground
among the wise and the wise were now freely permitted to rule the
reason and the fancy of the crowd it was demonstrated that the
density of the comets nucleus was far less than that of our rarest
gas and the harmless passage of a similar visitor among the
satellites of jupiter was a point strongly insisted upon, and which
served greatly to allay terror theologists, with an earnestness
fear-enkindled, dwelt upon the biblical prophecies, and expounded them
to the people with a directness and simplicity of which no previous
instance had been known that the final destruction of the earth must
be brought about by the agency of fire, was urged with a spirit that
enforced everywhere conviction and that the comets were of no fiery
nature as all men now knew was a truth which relieved all, in a
great measure, from the apprehension of the great calamity foretold
it is noticeable that the popular prejudices and vulgar errors in
regard to pestilences and wars--errors which were wont to prevail upon
every appearance of a comet--were now altogether unknown, as if by
some sudden convulsive exertion reason had at once hurled superstition
from her throne the feeblest intellect had derived vigor from
excessive interest
what minor evils might arise from the contact were points of elaborate
question the learned spoke of slight geological disturbances, of
probable alterations in climate, and consequently in vegetation of
possible magnetic and electric influences many held that no visible
or perceptible effect would in any manner be produced while such
discussions were going on, their subject gradually approached, growing
larger in apparent diameter, and of a more brilliant lustre mankind
grew paler as it came all human operations were suspended
there was an epoch in the course of the general sentiment when the
comet had attained, at length, a size surpassing that of any
previously recorded visitation the people now, dismissing any
lingering hope that the astronomers were wrong, experienced all the
certainty of evil the chimerical aspect of their terror was gone the
hearts of the stoutest of our race beat violently within their bosoms
a very few days suffered, however, to merge even such feelings in
sentiments more unendurable we could no longer apply to the strange
orb any accustomed thoughts its historical attributes had
disappeared it oppressed us with a hideous novelty of emotion we
saw it not as an astronomical phenomenon in the heavens, but as an
incubus upon our hearts and a shadow upon our brains it had taken,
with unconceivable rapidity, the character of a gigantic mantle of
rare flame, extending from horizon to horizon
yet a day, and men breathed with greater freedom it was clear that we
were already within the influence of the comet yet we lived we even
felt an unusual elasticity of frame and vivacity of mind the
exceeding tenuity of the object of our dread was apparent for all
heavenly objects were plainly visible through it meantime, our
vegetation had perceptibly altered and we gained faith, from this
predicted circumstance, in the foresight of the wise a wild
luxuriance of foliage, utterly unknown before, burst out upon every
vegetable thing
yet another day--and the evil was not altogether upon us it was now
evident that its nucleus would first reach us a wild change had come
over all men and the first sense of pain was the wild signal for
general lamentation and horror the first sense of pain lay in a
rigorous construction of the breast and lungs, and an insufferable
dryness of the skin it could not be denied that our atmosphere was
radically affected the conformation of this atmosphere and the
possible modifications to which it might be subjected, were now the
topics of discussion the result of investigation sent an electric
thrill of the intensest terror through the universal heart of man
it had been long known that the air which encircled us was a compound
of oxygen and nitrogen gases, in the proportion of twenty-one measures
of oxygen and seventy-nine of nitrogen in every one hundred of the
atmosphere oxygen, which was the principle of combustion, and the
vehicle of heat, was absolutely necessary to the support of animal
life, and was the most powerful and energetic agent in nature
nitrogen, on the contrary, was incapable of supporting either animal
life or flame an unnatural excess of oxygen would result, it had been
ascertained, in just such an elevation of the animal spirits as we had
latterly experienced it was the pursuit, the extension of the idea,
which had engendered awe what would be the result of a total
extraction of the nitrogen? a combustion irresistible, all-devouring,
omni-prevalent, immediate--the entire fulfilment, in all their
minute and terrible details, of the fiery and horror-inspiring
denunciations of the prophecies of the holy book
why need i paint, charmion, the now disenchained frenzy of mankind?
that tenuity in the comet which had previously inspired us with hope,
was now the source of the bitterness of despair in its impalpable
gaseous character we clearly perceived the consummation of fate
meantime a day again passed--bearing away with it the last shadow of
hope we gasped in the rapid modification of the air the red blood
bounded tumultuously through its strict channels a furious delirium
possessed all men and with arms rigidly outstretched towards the
threatening heavens, they trembled and shrieked aloud but the nucleus
of the destroyer was now upon us--even here in aidenn i shudder while
i speak let me be brief--brief as the ruin that overwhelmed for a
moment there was a wild lurid light alone, visiting and penetrating
all things then--let us bow down, charmion, before the excessive
majesty of the great god--then, there came a shouting and pervading
sound, as if from the mouth itself of him while the whole incumbent
mass of ether in which we existed, burst at once into a species of
intense flame, for whose surpassing brilliancy and all-fervid heat
even the angels in the high heaven of pure knowledge have no name
thus ended all

shadow--a parable
yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow
psalm of david
ye who read are still among the living but i who write shall have long
since gone my way into the region of shadows for indeed strange things
shall happen, and secret things be known, and many centuries shall pass
away, ere these memorials be seen of men and, when seen, there will be
some to disbelieve and some to doubt, and yet a few who will find much
to ponder upon in the characters here graven with a stylus of iron
the year had been a year of terror, and of feeling more intense than
terror for which there is no name upon the earth for many prodigies and
signs had taken place, and far and wide, over sea and land, the black
wings of the pestilence were spread abroad to those, nevertheless,
cunning in the stars, it was not unknown that the heavens wore an aspect
of ill and to me, the greek oinos, among others, it was evident that
now had arrived the alternation of that seven hundred and ninety-fourth
year when, at the entrance of aries, the planet jupiter is enjoined with
the red ring of the terrible saturnus the peculiar spirit of the skies,
if i mistake not greatly, made itself manifest, not only in the physical
orb of the earth, but in the souls, imaginations, and meditations of
mankind
over some flasks of the red chian wine, within the walls of a noble
hall, in a dim city called ptolemais, we sat, at night, a company of
seven and to our chamber there was no entrance save by a lofty door of
brass and the door was fashioned by the artisan corinnos, and, being of
rare workmanship, was fastened from within black draperies, likewise in
the gloomy room, shut out from our view the moon, the lurid stars, and
the peopleless streets--but the boding and the memory of evil, they
would not be so excluded there were things around us and about of which
i can render no distinct account--things material and spiritual--
heaviness in the atmosphere--a sense of suffocation--anxiety--and, above
all, that terrible state of existence which the nervous experience when
the senses are keenly living and awake, and meanwhile the powers of
thought lie dormant a dead weight hung upon us it hung upon our
limbs--upon the household furniture--upon the goblets from which we
drank and all things were depressed, and borne down thereby--all things
save only the flames of the seven iron lamps which illumined our revel
uprearing themselves in tall slender lines of light, they thus remained
burning all pallid and motionless and in the mirror which their lustre
formed upon the round table of ebony at which we sat each of us there
assembled beheld the pallor of his own countenance, and the unquiet
glare in the downcast eyes of his companions yet we laughed and were
merry in our proper way--which was hysterical and sang the songs of
anacreon--which are madness and drank deeply--although the purple wine
reminded us of blood for there was yet another tenant of our chamber in
the person of young zoilus dead and at full length he lay,
enshrouded--the genius and the demon of the scene alas he bore no
portion in our mirth, save that his countenance, distorted with the
plague, and his eyes in which death had but half extinguished the fire
of the pestilence, seemed to take such an interest in our merriment as
the dead may haply take in the merriment of those who are to die but
although i, oinos, felt that the eyes of the departed were upon me,
still i forced myself not to perceive the bitterness of their
expression, and gazing down steadily into the depths of the ebony
mirror, sang with a loud and sonorous voice the songs of the son of
teos but gradually my songs they ceased, and their echoes, rolling afar
off among the sable draperies of the chamber, became weak, and
undistinguishable, and so faded away and lo from among those sable
draperies, where the sounds of the song departed, there came forth a
dark and undefiled shadow--a shadow such as the moon, when low in
heaven, might fashion from the figure of a man but it was the shadow
neither of man nor of god, nor of any familiar thing and quivering
awhile among the draperies of the room it at length rested in full view
upon the surface of the door of brass but the shadow was vague, and
formless, and indefinite, and was the shadow neither of man nor
god--neither god of greece, nor god of chalda, nor any egyptian god
and the shadow rested upon the brazen doorway, and under the arch of the
entablature of the door and moved not, nor spoke any word, but there
became stationary and remained and the door whereupon the shadow rested
was, if i remember aright, over against the feet of the young zoilus
enshrouded but we, the seven there assembled, having seen the shadow as
it came out from among the draperies, dared not steadily behold it, but
cast down our eyes, and gazed continually into the depths of the mirror
of ebony and at length i, oinos, speaking some low words, demanded of
the shadow its dwelling and its appellation and the shadow answered, i
am shadow, and my dwelling is near to the catacombs of ptolemais, and
hard by those dim plains of helusion which border upon the foul
charonian canal and then did we, the seven, start from our seats in
horror, and stand trembling, and shuddering, and aghast for the tones
in the voice of the shadow were not the tones of any one being, but of a
multitude of beings, and varying in their cadences from syllable to
syllable, fell duskily upon our ears in the well remembered and familiar
accents of many thousand departed friends

silence--a fable
the mountain pinnacles slumber valleys, crags, and caves are silent
listen to me, said the demon, as he placed his hand upon my head
the region of which i speak is a dreary region in libya, by the borders
of the river zire and there is no quiet there, nor silence
the waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue and they flow
not onward to the sea, but palpitate forever and forever beneath the red
eye of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive motion for many miles
on either side of the rivers oozy bed is a pale desert of gigantic
water-lilies they sigh one unto the other in that solitude, and stretch
towards the heaven their long and ghastly necks, and nod to and fro
their everlasting heads and there is an indistinct murmur which cometh
out from among them like the rushing of subterrene water and they sigh
one unto the other
but there is a boundary to their realm--the boundary of the dark,
horrible, lofty forest there, like the waves about the hebrides, the
low underwood is agitated continually but there is no wind throughout
the heaven and the tall primeval trees rock eternally hither and
thither with a crashing and mighty sound and from their high summits,
one by one, drop everlasting dews and at the roots, strange poisonous
flowers lie writhing in perturbed slumber and overhead, with a rustling
and loud noise, the gray clouds rush westwardly forever until they roll,
a cataract, over the fiery wall of the horizon but there is no wind
throughout the heaven and by the shores of the river zire there is
neither quiet nor silence
it was night, and the rain fell and, falling, it was rain, but, having
fallen, it was blood and i stood in the morass among the tall lilies,
and the rain fell upon my head--and the lilies sighed one unto the other
in the solemnity of their desolation
and, all at once, the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist, and was
crimson in color and mine eyes fell upon a huge gray rock which stood
by the shore of the river and was lighted by the light of the moon and
the rock was gray and ghastly, and tall,--and the rock was gray upon
its front were characters engraven in the stones and i walked through
the morass of water-lilies, until i came close unto the shore, that i
might read the characters upon the stone but i could not decipher them
and i was going back into the morass when the moon shone with a fuller
red, and i turned and looked again upon the rock and upon the
characters--and the characters were desolation
and i looked upwards, and there stood a man upon the summit of the
rock and i hid myself among the water-lilies that i might discover the
action of the man and the man was tall and stately in form, and wrapped
up from his shoulders to his feet in the toga of old rome and the
outlines of his figure were indistinct--but his features were the
features of a deity for the mantle of the night, and of the mist, and
of the moon, and of the dew, had left uncovered the features of his
face and his brow was lofty with thought, and his eye wild with care
and in the few furrows upon his cheek, i read the fables of sorrow, and
weariness, and disgust with mankind, and a longing after solitude
and the man sat upon the rock, and leaned his head upon his hand, and
looked out upon the desolation he looked down into the low unquiet
shrubbery, and up into the tall primeval trees, and up higher at the
rustling heaven, and into the crimson moon and i lay close within
shelter of the lilies, and observed the actions of the man and the man
trembled in the solitude--but the night waned, and he sat upon the
rock
and the man turned his attention from the heaven, and looked out upon
the dreary river zire, and upon the yellow ghastly waters, and upon the
pale legions of the water-lilies and the man listened to the sighs of
the water-lilies, and to the murmur that came up from among them and i
lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man and the
man trembled in the solitude--but the night waned, and he sat upon the
rock
then i went down into the recesses of the morass, and waded afar in
among the wilderness of the lilies, and called unto the hippopotami
which dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the morass and the
hippopotami heard my call, and came, with the behemoth, unto the foot of
the rock, and roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon and i lay
close within my covert and observed the actions of the man and the man
trembled in the solitude--but the night waned, and he sat upon the
rock
then i cursed the elements with the curse of tumult and a frightful
tempest gathered in the heaven, where before there had been no wind and
the heaven became livid with the violence of the tempest--and the rain
beat upon the head of the man--and the floods of the river came
down--and the river was tormented into foam--and the water-lilies
shrieked within their beds--and the forest crumbled before the wind--and
the thunder rolled--and the lightning fell--and the rock rocked to its
foundation and i lay close within my covert and observed the actions of
the man and the man trembled in the solitude--but the night waned, and
he sat upon the rock
then i grew angry and cursed, with the curse of silence, the river, and
the lilies, and the wind, and the forest, and the heaven, and the
thunder, and the sighs of the water-lilies and they became accursed,
and were still and the moon ceased to totter up its pathway to
heaven--and the thunder died away--and the lightning did not flash--and
the clouds hung motionless--and the waters sunk to their level and
remained--and the trees ceased to rock--and the water-lilies sighed no
more--and the murmur was heard no longer from among them, nor any shadow
of sound throughout the vast illimitable desert and i looked upon the
characters of the rock, and they were changed--and the characters were
silence
and mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man, and his countenance
was wan with terror and, hurriedly, he raised his head from his hand,
and stood forth upon the rock and listened but there was no voice
throughout the vast illimitable desert, and the characters upon the rock
were silence and the man shuddered, and turned his face away, and fled
afar off, in haste, so that i beheld him no more

now there are fine tales in the volumes of the magi--in the iron-bound,
melancholy volumes of the magi therein, i say, are glorious histories
of the heaven, and of the earth, and of the mighty sea--and of the genii
that overruled the sea, and the earth, and the lofty heaven there was
much lore, too, in the sayings which were said by the sybils and holy,
holy things were heard of old by the dim leaves that trembled around
dodona--but, as allah liveth, that fable which the demon told me as he
sat by my side in the shadow of the tomb, i hold to be the most
wonderful of all and as the demon made an end of his story, he fell
back within the cavity of the tomb and laughed and i could not laugh
with the demon, and he cursed me because i could not laugh and the lynx
which dwelleth forever in the tomb, came out therefrom, and lay down at
the feet of the demon, and looked at him steadily in the face

essays

the poetic principle
in speaking of the poetic principle, i have no design to be either
thorough or profound while discussing very much at random the
essentiality of what we call poetry, my principal purpose will be to
cite for consideration some few of those minor english or american poems
which best suit my own taste, or which, upon my own fancy, have left the
most definite impression by minor poems i mean, of course, poems of
little length and here, in the beginning, permit me to say a few words
in regard to a somewhat peculiar principle, which, whether rightfully or
wrongfully, has always had its influence in my own critical estimate of
the poem i hold that a long poem does not exist i maintain that the
phrase, a long poem, is simply a flat contradiction in terms
i need scarcely observe that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as
it excites, by elevating the soul the value of the poem is in the ratio
of this elevating excitement but all excitements are, through a psychal
necessity, transient that degree of excitement which would entitle a
poem to be so called at all, cannot be sustained throughout a
composition of any great length after the lapse of half an hour, at the
very utmost, it flags--fails--a revulsion ensues--and then the poem is,
in effect, and in fact, no longer such
there are, no doubt, many who have found difficulty in reconciling the
critical dictum that the paradise lost is to be devoutly admired
throughout, with the absolute impossibility of maintaining for it,
during perusal, the amount of enthusiasm which that critical dictum
would demand this great work, in fact, is to be regarded as poetical
only when, losing sight of that vital requisite in all works of art,
unity, we view it merely as a series of minor poems if, to preserve its
unity--its totality of effect or impression--we read it as would be
necessary at a single sitting, the result is but a constant alternation
of excitement and depression after a passage of what we feel to be true
poetry, there follows, inevitably, a passage of platitude which no
critical prejudgment can force us to admire but if, upon completing the
work, we read it again omitting the first book--that is to say,
commencing with the second--we shall be surprised at now finding that
admirable which we before condemned--that damnable which we had
previously so much admired it follows from all this that the ultimate,
aggregate, or absolute effect of even the best epic under the sun, is a
nullity--and this is precisely the fact
in regard to the iliad, we have, if not positive proof, at least very
good reason, for believing it intended as a series of lyrics but,
granting the epic intention, i can say only that the work is based in an
imperfect sense of art the modern epic is, of the supposititious
ancient model, but an inconsiderate and blindfold imitation but the day
of these artistic anomalies is over if, at any time, any very long poem
were popular in reality--which i doubt--it is at least clear that no
very long poem will ever be popular again
that the extent of a poetical work is ceteris paribus, the measure of
its merit, seems undoubtedly, when we thus state it, a proposition
sufficiently absurd--yet we are indebted for it to the quarterly
reviews surely there can be nothing in mere size, abstractly
considered--there can be nothing in mere bulk, so far as a volume is
concerned, which has so continuously elicited admiration from these
saturnine pamphlets a mountain, to be sure, by the mere sentiment of
physical magnitude which it conveys, does impress us with a sense of
the sublime--but no man is impressed after this fashion by the
material grandeur of even the columbiad even the quarterlies have not
instructed us to be so impressed by it as yet, they have not
insisted on our estimating lamartine by the cubic foot, or pollock by
the pound--but what else are we to infer from their continual prating
about sustained effort? if, by sustained effort, any little
gentleman has accomplished an epic, let us frankly commend him for the
effort--if this indeed be a thing commendable--but let us forbear
praising the epic on the efforts account it is to be hoped thai common
sense, in the time to come, will prefer deciding upon a work of art
rather by the impression it makes--by the effect it produces--than by
the time it took to impress the effect, or by the amount of sustained
effort which had been found necessary in effecting the impression the
fact is, that perseverance is one thing and genius quite another--nor
can all the quarterlies in christendom confound them by and by, this
proposition, with many which i have been just urging, will be received
as self-evident in the meantime, by being generally condemned as
falsities, they will not be essentially damaged as truths
on the other hand, it is clear that a poem may be improperly brief
undue brevity degenerates into mere epigrammatism a very short poem,
while now and then producing a brilliant or vivid, never produces a
profound or enduring effect there must be the steady pressing down of
the stamp upon the wax de branger has wrought innumerable things,
pungent and spirit-stirring, but in general they have been too
imponderous to stamp themselves deeply into the public attention, and
thus, as so many feathers of fancy, have been blown aloft only to be
whistled down the wind
a remarkable instance of the effect of undue brevity in depressing a
poem, in keeping it out of the popular view, is afforded by the
following exquisite little serenade
i arise from dreams of thee
in the first sweet sleep of night
when the winds are breathing low,
and the stars are shining bright
i arise from dreams of thee,
and a spirit in my feet
has led me--who knows how?--
to thy chamber-window, sweet
the wandering airs they faint
on the dark the silent stream--
the champak odors fail
like sweet thoughts in a dream
the nightingales complaint,
it dies upon her heart,
as i must die on thine,
o, beloved as thou art
o, lift me from the grass
i die, i faint, i fail
let thy love in kisses rain
on my lips and eyelids pale
my cheek is cold and white, alas
my heart beats loud and fast
o, press it close to thine again,
where it will break at last
very few perhaps are familiar with these lines, yet no less a poet than
shelley is their author their warm, yet delicate and ethereal
imagination will be appreciated by all, but by none so thoroughly as by
him who has himself arisen from sweet dreams of one beloved to bathe in
the aromatic air of a southern midsummer night
one of the finest poems by willis, the very best in my opinion which he
has ever written, has no doubt, through this same defect of undue
brevity, been kept back from its proper position, not less in the
critical than in the popular view
the shadows lay along broadway,
twas near the twilight-tide--
and slowly there a lady fair
was walking in her pride
alone walkd she but, viewlessly
walkd spirits at her side
peace charmd the street beneath her feet,
and honor charmd the air
and all astir looked kind on her,
and called her good as fair--
for all god ever gave to her
she kept with chary care
she kept with care her beauties rare
from lovers warm and true--
for heart was cold to all but gold,
and the rich came not to woo--
but honord well her charms to sell,
if priests the selling do
now walking there was one more fair--
a slight girl, lily-pale
and she had unseen company
to make the spirit quail--
twixt want and scorn she walkd forlorn,
and nothing could avail
no mercy now can clear her brow
from this worlds peace to pray,
for as loves wild prayer dissolved in air,
her womans heart gave way--
but the sin forgiven by christ in heaven,
by man is cursed alway
in this composition we find it difficult to recognise the willis who has
written so many mere verses of society the lines are not only richly
ideal but full of energy, while they breathe an earnestness, an evident
sincerity of sentiment, for which we look in vain throughout all the
other works of this author
while the epic mania, while the idea that to merit in poetry prolixity
is indispensable, has for some years past been gradually dying out of
the public mind, by mere dint of its own absurdity, we find it succeeded
by a heresy too palpably false to be long tolerated, but one which, in
the brief period it has already endured, may be said to have
accomplished more in the corruption of our poetical literature than all
its other enemies combined i allude to the heresy of the didactic it
has been assumed, tacitly and avowedly, directly and indirectly, that
the ultimate object of all poetry is truth every poem, it is said,
should inculcate a moral, and by this moral is the poetical merit of the
work to be adjudged we americans especially have patronized this happy
idea, and we bostonians very especially have developed it in full we
have taken it into our heads that to write a poem simply for the poems
sake, and to acknowledge such to have been our design, would be to
confess ourselves radically wanting in the true poetic dignity and
force--but the simple fact is that would we but permit ourselves to
look into our own souls we should immediately there discover that under
the sun there neither exists nor can exist any work more thoroughly
dignified, more supremely noble, than this very poem, this poem per
se, this poem which is a poem and nothing more, this poem written
solely for the poems sake
with as deep a reverence for the true as ever inspired the bosom of man,
i would nevertheless limit, in some measure, its modes of inculcation i
would limit to enforce them i would not enfeeble them by dissipation
the demands of truth are severe she has no sympathy with the myrtles
all that which is so indispensable in song is precisely all that
with which she has nothing whatever to do it is but making her a
flaunting paradox to wreathe her in gems and flowers in enforcing a
truth we need severity rather than efflorescence of language we must be
simple, precise, terse we must be cool, calm, unimpassioned in a word,
we must be in that mood which, as nearly as possible, is the exact
converse of the poetical he must be blind indeed who does not
perceive the radical and chasmal difference between the truthful and the
poetical modes of inculcation he must be theory-mad beyond redemption
who, in spite of these differences, shall still persist in attempting to
reconcile the obstinate oils and waters of poetry and truth
dividing the world of mind into its three most immediately obvious
distinctions, we have the pure intellect, taste, and the moral sense i
place taste in the middle because it is just this position which in the
mind it occupies it holds intimate relations with either extreme but
from the moral sense is separated by so faint a difference that
aristotle has not hesitated to place some of its operations among the
virtues themselves nevertheless we find the offices of the trio
marked with a sufficient distinction just as the intellect concerns
itself with truth, so taste informs us of the beautiful, while the moral
sense is regardful of duty of this latter, while conscience teaches the
obligation, and reason the expediency, taste contents herself with
displaying the charms, waging war upon vice solely on the ground of her
deformity, her disproportion, her animosity to the fitting, to the
appropriate, to the harmonious, in a word, to beauty
an immortal instinct deep within the spirit of man is thus plainly a
sense of the beautiful this it is which administers to his delight in
the manifold forms, and sounds, and odors, and sentiments amid which he
exists and just as the lily is repeated in the lake, or the eyes of
amaryllis in the mirror, so is the mere oral or written repetition of
these forms, and sounds, and colors, and odors, and sentiments a
duplicate source of delight but this mere repetition is not poetry he
who shall simply sing, with however glowing enthusiasm, or with however
vivid a truth of description, of the sights, and sounds, and odors, and
colors, and sentiments which greet him in common with all mankind--he, i
say, has yet failed to prove his divine title there is still a
something in the distance which he has been unable to attain we have
still a thirst unquenchable, to allay which he has not shown us the
crystal springs this thirst belongs to the immortality of man it is at
once a consequence and an indication of his perennial existence it is
the desire of the moth for the star it is no mere appreciation of the
beauty before us, but a wild effort to reach the beauty above inspired
by an ecstatic prescience of the glories beyond the grave, we struggle
by multiform combinations among the things and thoughts of time to
attain a portion of that loveliness whose very elements perhaps
appertain to eternity alone and thus when by poetry, or when by music,
the most entrancing of the poetic moods, we find ourselves melted into
tears, we weep then, not as the abbate gravina supposes, through excess
of pleasure, but through a certain petulant, impatient sorrow at our
inability to grasp now, wholly, here on earth, at once and forever,
those divine and rapturous joys of which through the poem, or
through the music, we attain to but brief and indeterminate glimpses
the struggle to apprehend the supernal loveliness--this struggle, on the
part of souls fittingly constituted--has given to the world all that
which it the world has ever been enabled at once to understand and to
feel as poetic
the poetic sentiment, of course, may develop itself in various modes--in
painting, in sculpture, in architecture, in the dance--very especially
in music--and very peculiarly, and with a wide field, in the composition
of the landscape garden our present theme, however, has regard only to
its manifestation in words and here let me speak briefly on the topic
of rhythm contenting myself with the certainty that music, in its
various modes of metre, rhythm, and rhyme, is of so vast a moment in
poetry as never to be wisely rejected--is so vitally important an
adjunct, that he is simply silly who declines its assistance, i will not
now pause to maintain its absolute essentiality it is in music perhaps
that the soul most nearly attains the great end for which, when inspired
by the poetic sentiment, it struggles--the creation of supernal beauty
it may be, indeed, that here this sublime end is, now and, then,
attained in fact we are often made to feel, with a shivering delight,
that from an earthly harp are stricken notes which cannot have been
unfamiliar to the angels and thus there can be little doubt that in the
union of poetry with music in its popular sense, we shall find the
widest field for the poetic development the old bards and minnesingers
had advantages which we do not possess--and thomas moore, singing his
own songs, was, in the most legitimate manner, perfecting them as poems
to recapitulate then--i would define, in brief, the poetry of words as
the rhythmical creation of beauty its sole arbiter is taste with the
intellect or with the conscience it has only collateral relations
unless incidentally, it has no concern whatever either with duty or with
truth
a few words, however, in explanation that pleasure which is at once
the most pure, the most elevating, and the most intense, is derived, i
maintain, from the contemplation of the beautiful in the contemplation
of beauty we alone find it possible to attain that pleasurable
elevation, or excitement of the soul, which we recognize as the poetic
sentiment, and which is so easily distinguished from truth, which is the
satisfaction of the reason, or from passion, which is the excitement of
the heart i make beauty, therefore--using the word as inclusive of the
sublime--i make beauty the province of the poem, simply because it is an
obvious rule of art that effects should be made to spring as directly as
possible from their causes--no one as yet having been weak enough to
deny that the peculiar elevation in question is at least most readily
attainable in the poem it by no means follows, however, that the
incitements of passion, or the precepts of duty, or even the lessons of
truth, may not be introduced into a poem, and with advantage for they
may subserve incidentally, in various ways, the general purposes of the
work but the true artist will always contrive to tone them down in
proper subjection to that beauty which is the atmosphere and the real
essence of the poem
i cannot better introduce the few poems which i shall present for your
consideration, than by the citation of the prem to longfellows waif
the day is done, and the darkness
falls from the wings of night,
as a feather is wafted downward
from an eagle in his flight
i see the lights of the village
gleam through the rain and the mist,
and a feeling of sadness comes oer me,
that my soul cannot resist
a feeling of sadness and longing,
that is not akin to pain,
and resembles sorrow only
as the mist resembles the rain
come, read to me some poem,
some simple and heartfelt lay,
that shall soothe this restless feeling,
and banish the thoughts of day
not from the grand old masters,
not from the bards sublime,
whose distant footsteps echo
through the corridors of time
for, like strains of martial music,
their mighty thoughts suggest
lifes endless toil and endeavor
and to-night i long for rest
read from some humbler poet,
whose songs gushed from his heart,
as showers from the clouds of summer,
or tears from the eyelids start
who through long days of labor,
and nights devoid of ease,
still heard in his soul the music
of wonderful melodies
such songs have power to quiet
the restless pulse of care,
and come like the benediction
that follows after prayer
then read from the treasured volume
the poem of thy choice,
and lend to the rhyme of the poet
the beauty of thy voice
and the night shall be filled with music,
and the cares that infest the day,
shall fold their tents like the arabs,
and as silently steal away
with no great range of imagination, these lines have been justly admired
for their delicacy of expression some of the images are very effective
nothing can be better than
--the bards sublime,
whose distant footsteps echo
down the corridors of time
the idea of the last quatrain is also very effective the poem on the
whole, however, is chiefly to be admired for the graceful insouciance
of its metre, so well in accordance with the character of the
sentiments, and especially for the ease of the general manner this
ease or naturalness, in a literary style, it has long been the fashion
to regard as ease in appearance alone--as a point of really difficult
attainment but not so--a natural manner is difficult only to him who
should never meddle with it--to the unnatural it is but the result of
writing with the understanding, or with the instinct, that the tone,
in composition, should always be that which the mass of mankind would
adopt--and must perpetually vary, of course, with the occasion the
author who, after the fashion of the north american review, should be
upon all occasions merely quiet, must necessarily upon many
occasions be simply silly, or stupid and has no more right to be
considered easy or natural than a cockney exquisite, or than the
sleeping beauty in the waxworks
among the minor poems of bryant, none has so much impressed me as the
one which he entitles june i quote only a portion of it
there, through the long, long summer hours,
the golden light should lie,
and thick young herbs and groups of flowers
stand in their beauty by
the oriole should build and tell
his love-tale, close beside my cell
the idle butterfly
should rest him there, and there be heard
the housewife-bee and humming bird
and what, if cheerful shouts at noon,
come, from the village sent,
or songs of maids, beneath the moon,
with fairy laughter blent?
and what if, in the evening light,
betrothed lovers walk in sight
of my low monument?
i would the lovely scene around
might know no sadder sight nor sound
i know, i know i should not see
the seasons glorious show,
nor would its brightness shine for me
nor its wild music flow
but if, around my place of sleep,
the friends i love should come to weep,
they might not haste to go
soft airs and song, and light and bloom,
should keep them lingering by my tomb
these to their softend hearts should bear
the thought of what has been,
and speak of one who cannot share
the gladness of the scene
whose part in all the pomp that fills
the circuit of the summer hills,
is--that his grave is green
and deeply would their hearts rejoice
to hear again his living voice
the rhythmical flow here is even voluptuous--nothing could be more
melodious the poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner the
intense melancholy which seems to well up, perforce, to the surface of
all the poets cheerful sayings about his grave, we find thrilling us to
the soul--while there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill the
impression left is one of a pleasurable sadness and if, in the
remaining compositions which i shall introduce to you, there be more or
less of a similar tone always apparent, let me remind you that how or
why we know not this certain taint of sadness is inseparably connected
with all the higher manifestations of true beauty it is, nevertheless,
a feeling of sadness and longing
that is not akin to pain,
and resembles sorrow only
as the mist resembles the rain
the taint of which i speak is clearly perceptible even in a poem so full
of brilliancy and spirit as the health of edward coote pinkney
i fill this cup to one made up
of loveliness alone,
a woman, of her gentle sex
the seeming paragon
to whom the better elements
and kindly stars have given
a form so fair, that like the air,
tis less of earth than heaven
her every tone is musics own,
like those of morning birds,
and something more than melody
dwells ever in her words
the coinage of her heart are they,
and from her lips each flows
as one may see the burdend bee
forth issue from the rose
affections are as thoughts to her,
the measures of her hours
her feelings have the fragrancy,
the freshness of young flowers
and lovely passions, changing oft,
so fill her, she appears
the image of themselves by turns,--
the idol of past years
of her bright face one glance will trace
a picture on the brain,
and of her voice in echoing hearts
a sound must long remain
but memory, such as mine of her,
so very much endears,
when death is nigh my latest sigh
will not be lifes, but hers
i filld this cup to one made up
of loveliness alone,
a woman, of her gentle sex
the seeming paragon--
her health and would on earth there stood,
some more of such a frame,
that life might be all poetry,
and weariness a name
it was the misfortune of mr pinkney to have been born too far south
had he been a new englander, it is probable that he would have been
ranked as the first of american lyrists by that magnanimous cabal which
has so long controlled the destinies of american letters, in conducting
the thing called the north american review the poem just cited is
especially beautiful but the poetic elevation which it induces we must
refer chiefly to our sympathy in the poets enthusiasm we pardon his
hyperboles for the evident earnestness with which they are uttered
it was by no means my design, however, to expatiate upon the merits
of what i should read you these will necessarily speak for themselves
boccalina, in his advertisements from parnassus, tells us that zoilus
once presented apollo a very caustic criticism upon a very admirable
book--whereupon the god asked him for the beauties of the work he
replied that he only busied himself about the errors on hearing this,
apollo, handing him a sack of unwinnowed wheat, bade him pick out all
the chaff for his reward
now this fable answers very well as a hit at the critics--but i am by no
means sure that the god was in the right i am by no means certain that
the true limits of the critical duty are not grossly misunderstood
excellence, in a poem especially, may be considered in the light of an
axiom, which need only be properly put, to become self-evident it is
not excellence if it require to be demonstrated its such--and thus to
point out too particularly the merits of a work of art, is to admit that
they are not merits altogether
among the melodies of thomas moore is one whose distinguished
character as a poem proper seems to have been singularly left out of
view i allude to his lines beginning--come, rest in this bosom the
intense energy of their expression is not surpassed by anything in
byron there are two of the lines in which a sentiment is conveyed that
embodies the all in all of the divine passion of love--a sentiment
which, perhaps, has found its echo in more, and in more passionate,
human hearts that any other single sentiment ever embodied in words
come, rest in this bosom, my own stricken deer,
though the herd have fled from thee, thy home is still here
here still is the smile, that no cloud can oercast,
and a heart and a hand all thy own to the last
oh what was love made for, if tis not the same
through joy and through torment, through glory and shame?
i know not, i ask not, if guilts in that heart,
i but know that i love thee, whatever thou art
thou hast calld me thy angel in moments of bliss,
and thy angel ill be,mid the horrors of this,--
through the furnace, unshrinking, thy steps to pursue,
and shield thee, and save thee,--or perish there too
it has been the fashion of late days to deny moore imagination, while
granting him fancy--a distinction originating with coleridge--than whom
no man more fully comprehended the great powers of moore the fact is,
that the fancy of this poet so far predominates over all his other
faculties, and over the fancy of all other men, as to have induced, very
naturally, the idea that he is fanciful only but never was there a
greater mistake never was a grosser wrong done the fame of a true poet
in the compass of the english language i can call to mind no poem more
profoundly--more weirdly imaginative, in the best sense, than the
lines commencing--i would i were by that dim lake--which are the
composition of thomas moore i regret that i am unable to remember them
one of the noblest--and, speaking of fancy--one of the most singularly
fanciful of modern poets, was thomas hood his fair ines had always
for me an inexpressible charm
o saw ye not fair ines?
shes gone into the west,
to dazzle when the sun is down
and rob the world of rest
she took our daylight with her,
the smiles that we love best,
with morning blushes on her cheek,
and pearls upon her breast
o turn again, fair ines,
before the fall of night,
for fear the moon should shine alone,
and stars unrivalld bright
and blessed will the lover be
that walks beneath their light,
and breathes the love against thy cheek
i dare not even write
would i had been, fair ines,
that gallant cavalier,
who rode so gaily by thy side,
and whisperd thee so near
were there no bonny dames at home,
or no true lovers here,
that he should cross the seas to win
the dearest of the dear?
i saw thee, lovely ines,
descend along the shore,
with bands of noble gentlemen,
and banners-waved before
and gentle youth and maidens gay,
and snowy plumes they wore
it would have been a beauteous dream,
if it had been no more
alas, alas, fair ines,
she went away with song,
with music waiting on her steps,
and shoutings of the throng
but some were sad and felt no mirth,
but only musics wrong,
in sounds that sang farewell, farewell,
to her youve loved so long
farewell, farewell, fair ines,
that vessel never bore
so fair a lady on its deck,
nor danced so light before,--
alas for pleasure on the sea,
and sorrow on the shore
the smile that blest one lovers heart
has broken many more
the haunted house, by the same author, is one of the truest poems ever
written,--one of the truest, one of the most unexceptionable, one of the
most thoroughly artistic, both in its theme and in its execution it is,
moreover, powerfully ideal--imaginative i regret that its length
renders it unsuitable for the purposes of this lecture in place of it
permit me to offer the universally appreciated bridge of sighs
one more unfortunate,
weary of breath,
rashly importunate
gone to her death
take her up tenderly,
lift her with care--
fashiond so slenderly,
young and so fair
look at her garments
clinging like cerements
whilst the wave constantly
drips from her clothing
take her up instantly,
loving, not loathing
touch her not scornfully
think of her mournfully,
gently and humanly
not of the stains of her,
all that remains of her
now is pure womanly
make no deep scrutiny
into her mutiny
rash and undutiful
past all dishonor,
death has left on her
only the beautiful
where the lamps quiver
so far in the river,
with many a light
from window and casement,
from garret to basement,
she stood, with amazement,
houseless by night
the bleak wind of march
made her tremble and shiver
but not the dark arch,
or the black flowing river
mad from lifes history,
glad to deaths mystery,
swift to be hurld--
anywhere, anywhere
out of the world
in she plunged boldly,
no matter how coldly
the rough river ran,--
over the brink of it,
picture it,--think of it,
dissolute man
lave in it, drink of it
then, if you can
still, for all slips of hers,
one of eves family--
wipe those poor lips of hers
oozing so clammily,
loop up her tresses
escaped from the comb,
her fair auburn tresses
whilst wonderment guesses
where was her home?
who was her father?
who was her mother
had she a sister?
had she a brother?
or was there a dearer one
still, and a nearer one
yet, than all other?
alas for the rarity
of christian charity
under the sun
oh it was pitiful
near a whole city full,
home she had none
sisterly, brotherly,
fatherly, motherly,
feelings had changed
love, by harsh evidence,
thrown from its eminence
even gods providence
seeming estranged
take her up tenderly
lift her with care
fashiond so slenderly,
young, and so fair
ere her limbs frigidly
stiffen too rigidly,
decently,--kindly,--
smooth and compose them
and her eyes, close them,
staring so blindly
dreadfully staring
through muddy impurity,
as when with the daring
last look of despairing
fixed on futurity
perishing gloomily,
spurred by contumely,
cold inhumanity,
burning insanity,
into her rest,--
cross her hands humbly,
as if praying dumbly,
over her breast
owning her weakness,
her evil behavior,
and leaving, with meekness,
her sins to her saviour
the vigor of this poem is no less remarkable than its pathos the
versification, although carrying the fanciful to the very verge of the
fantastic, is nevertheless admirably adapted to the wild insanity which
is the thesis of the poem
among the minor poems of lord byron is one which has never received from
the critics the praise which it undoubtedly deserves
though the day of my destinys over,
and the star of my fate hath declined,
thy soft heart refused to discover
the faults which so many could find
though thy soul with my grief was acquainted,
it shrunk not to share it with me,
and the love which my spirit hath painted
it never hath found but in thee
then when nature around me is smiling,
the last smile which answers to mine,
i do not believe it beguiling,
because it reminds me of thine
and when winds are at war with the ocean,
as the breasts i believed in with me,
if their billows excite an emotion,
it is that they bear me from thee
though the rock of my last hope is shivered,
and its fragments are sunk in the wave,
though i feel that my soul is delivered
to pain--it shall not be its slave
there is many a pang to pursue me
they may crush, but they shall not contemn--
they may torture, but shall not subdue me--
tis of thee that i think--not of them
though human, thou didst not deceive me,
though woman, thou didst not forsake,
though loved, thou forborest to grieve me,
though slandered, thou never couldst shake,--
though trusted, thou didst not disclaim me,
though parted, it was not to fly,
though watchful, twas not to defame me,
nor mute, that the world might belie
yet i blame not the world, nor despise it,
nor the war of the many with one--
if my soul was not fitted to prize it,
twas folly not sooner to shun
and if dearly that error hath cost me,
and more than i once could foresee,
i have found that whatever it lost me,
it could not deprive me of thee
from the wreck of the past, which hath perished,
thus much i at least may recall,
it hath taught me that which i most cherished
deserved to be dearest of all
in the desert a fountain is springing,
in the wide waste there still is a tree,
and a bird in the solitude singing,
which speaks to my spirit of thee
although the rhythm here is one of the most difficult, the versification
could scarcely be improved no nobler theme ever engaged the pen of
poet it is the soul-elevating idea that no man can consider himself
entitled to complain of fate while in his adversity he still retains the
unwavering love of woman
from alfred tennyson, although in perfect sincerity i regard him as the
noblest poet that ever lived, i have left myself time to cite only a
very brief specimen i call him, and think him the noblest of poets,
not because the impressions he produces are at all times the most
profound--not because the poetical excitement which he induces is at
all times the most intense--but because it is at all times the most
ethereal--in other words, the most elevating and most pure no poet is
so little of the earth, earthy what i am about to read is from his last
long poem, the princess
tears, idle tears, i know not what they mean,
tears from the depth of some divine despair
rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,
in looking on the happy autumn fields,
and thinking of the days that are no more
fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,
that brings our friends up from the underworld,
sad as the last which reddens over one
that sinks with all we love below the verge
so sad, so fresh, the days that are no more
ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns
the earliest pipe of half-awakend birds
to dying ears, when unto dying eyes
the casement slowly grows a glimmering square
so sad, so strange, the days that are no more
dear as rememberd kisses after death,
and sweet as those by hopeless fancy feignd
on lips that are for others deep as love,
deep as first love, and wild with all regret
o death in life, the days that are no more
thus, although in a very cursory and imperfect manner, i have endeavored
to convey to you my conception of the poetic principle it has been my
purpose to suggest that, while this principle itself is strictly and
simply the human aspiration for supernal beauty, the manifestation of
the principle is always found in an elevating excitement of the soul,
quite independent of that passion which is the intoxication of the
heart, or of that truth which is the satisfaction of the reason for in
regard to passion, alas its tendency is to degrade rather than to
elevate the soul love, on the contrary--love--the true, the divine
eros--the uranian as distinguished from the dionasan venus--is
unquestionably the purest and truest of all poetical themes and in
regard to truth, if, to be sure, through the attainment of a truth we
are led to perceive a harmony where none was apparent before, we
experience at once the true poetical effect but this effect is
referable to the harmony alone, and not in the least degree to the truth
which merely served to render the harmony manifest
we shall reach, however, more immediately a distinct conception of what
true poetry is, by mere reference to a few of the simple elements which
induce in the poet himself the true poetical effect he recognizes the
ambrosia which nourishes his soul in the bright orbs that shine in
heaven, in the volutes of the flower, in the clustering of low
shrubberies, in the waving of the grain-fields, in the slanting of tall
eastern trees, in the blue distance of mountains, in the grouping of
clouds, in the twinkling of half-hidden brooks, in the gleaming of
silver rivers, in the repose of sequestered lakes, in the star-mirroring
depths of lonely wells he perceives it in the songs of birds, in the
harp of olus, in the sighing of the night-wind, in the repining voice
of the forest, in the surf that complains to the shore, in the fresh
breath of the woods, in the scent of the violet, in the voluptuous
perfume of the hyacinth, in the suggestive odor that comes to him at
eventide from far-distant undiscovered islands, over dim oceans,
illimitable and unexplored he owns it in all noble thoughts, in all
unworldly motives, in all holy impulses, in all chivalrous, generous,
and self-sacrificing deeds he feels it in the beauty of woman, in the
grace of her step, in the lustre of her eye, in the melody of her voice,
in her soft laughter, in her sigh, in the harmony of the rustling of her
robes he deeply feels it in her winning endearments, in her burning
enthusiasms, in her gentle charities, in her meek and devotional
endurance, but above all, ah, far above all, he kneels to it, he
worships it in the faith, in the purity, in the strength, in the
altogether divine majesty of her love
let me conclude by the recitation of yet another brief poem, one very
different in character from any that i have before quoted it is by
motherwell, and is called the song of the cavalier with our modern
and altogether rational ideas of the absurdity and impiety of warfare,
we are not precisely in that frame of mind best adapted to sympathize
with the sentiments, and thus to appreciate the real excellence of the
poem to do this fully we must identify ourselves in fancy with the soul
of the old cavalier
a steed a steed of matchless speede
a sword of metal keene
al else to noble heartes is drosse--
al else on earth is meane
the neighynge of the war-horse prowde
the rowleing of the drum,
the clangor of the trumpet lowde--
be soundes from heaven that come
and oh the thundering presse of knightes,
when as their war-cryes welle,
may tole from heaven an angel bright,
and rowse a fiend from hell,
then mounte then mounte, brave gallants all,
and don your helmes amaine,
deathes couriers, fame and honor, call
us to the field againe
no shrewish teares shall fill your eye
when the sword-hilts in our hand,--
heart-whole well part, and no whit sighe
for the fayrest of the land
let piping swaine, and craven wight,
thus weepe and puling crye,
our business is like men to fight,
and hero-like to die
