a dented spider like a snow drop white
on a white heal-all, holding up a moth
like a white piece of lifeless satin cloth -
saw ever curious eye so strange a sight? -
portent in little, assorted death and blight
like the ingredients of a witches broth? -
the beady spider, the flower like a froth,
and the moth carried like a paper kite
what had that flower to do with being white,
the blue prunella every childs delight
what brought the kindred spider to that height?
make we no thesis of the millers plight
what but design of darkness and of night?
design, design do i use the word aright?
anonymous submission
a boundless moment
he halted in the wind, and -- what was that
far in the maples, pale, but not a ghost?
he stood there bringing march against his thought,
and yet too ready to believe the most
oh, thats the paradise-in-bloom, i said
and truly it was fair enough for flowers
had we but in us to assume in march
such white luxuriance of may for ours
we stood a moment so in a strange world,
myself as one his own pretense deceives
and then i said the truth and we moved on
a young beech clinging to its last years leaves
a brook in the city
the farmhouse lingers, though averse to square
with the new city street it has to wear
a number in but what about the brook
that held the house as in an elbow-crook?
i ask as one who knew the brook, its strength
and impulse, having dipped a finger length
and made it leap my knuckle, having tossed
a flower to try its currents where they crossed
the meadow grass could be cemented down
from growing under pavements of a town
the apple trees be sent to hearth-stone flame
is water wood to serve a brook the same?
how else dispose of an immortal force
no longer needed? staunch it at its source
with cinder loads dumped down? the brook was thrown
deep in a sewer dungeon under stone
in fetid darkness still to live and run --
and all for nothing it had ever done
except forget to go in fear perhaps
no one would know except for ancient maps
that such a brook ran water but i wonder
if from its being kept forever under,
the thoughts may not have risen that so keep
this new-built city from both work and sleep
a cliff dwelling
there sandy seems the golden sky
and golden seems the sandy plain
no habitation meets the eye
unless in the horizon rim,
some halfway up the limestone wall,
that spot of black is not a stain
or shadow, but a cavern hole,
where someone used to climb and crawl
to rest from his besetting fears
i see the callus on his soul
the disappearing last of him
and of his race starvation slim,
oh years ago - ten thousand years
a considerable speck
microscopic
a speck that would have been beneath my sight
on any but a paper sheet so white
set off across what i had written there
and i had idly poised my pen in air
to stop it with a period of ink
when something strange about it made me think,
this was no dust speck by my breathing blown,
but unmistakably a living mite
with inclinations it could call its own
it paused as with suspicion of my pen,
and then came racing wildly on again
to where my manuscript was not yet dry
then paused again and either drank or smelt--
with loathing, for again it turned to fly
plainly with an intelligence i dealt
it seemed too tiny to have room for feet,
yet must have had a set of them complete
to express how much it didnt want to die
it ran with terror and with cunning crept
it faltered i could see it hesitate
then in the middle of the open sheet
cower down in desperation to accept
whatever i accorded it of fate
i have none of the tenderer-than-thou
collectivistic regimenting love
with which the modern world is being swept
but this poor microscopic item now
since it was nothing i knew evil of
i let it lie there till i hope it slept
i have a mind myself and recognize
mind when i meet with it in any guise
no one can know how glad i am to find
on any sheet the least display of mind
a dream pang
i had withdrawn in forest, and my song
was swallowed up in leaves that blew alway
and to the forest edge you came one day
this was my dream and looked and pondered long,
but did not enter, though the wish was strong
you shook your pensive head as who should say,
i dare nottoo far in his footsteps stray
he must seek me would he undo the wrong
not far, but near, i stood and saw it all
behind low boughs the trees let down outside
and the sweet pang it cost me not to call
and tell you that i saw does still abide
but tis not true that thus i dwelt aloof,
for the wood wakes, and you are here for proof
a late walk
when i go up through the mowing field,
the headless aftermath,
smooth-laid like thatch with the heavy dew,
half closes the garden path
and when i come to the garden ground,
the whir of sober birds
up from the tangle of withered weeds
is sadder than any words
a tree beside the wall stands bare,
but a leaf that lingered brown,
disturbed, i doubt not, by my thought,
comes softly rattling down
i end not far from my going forth
by picking the faded blue
of the last remaining aster flower
to carry again to you
a line-storm song
the line-storm clouds fly tattered and swift,
the road is forlorn all day,
where a myriad snowy quartz stones lift,
and the hoof-prints vanish away
the roadside flowers, too wet for the bee,
expend their bloom in vain
come over the hills and far with me,
and be my love in the rain
the birds have less to say for themselves
in the wood-worlds torn despair
than now these numberless years the elves,
although they are no less there
all song of the woods is crushed like some
wild, easily shattered rose
come, be my love in the wet woods come,
where the boughs rain when it blows
there is the gale to urge behind
and bruit our singing down,
and the shallow waters aflutter with wind
from which to gather your gown
what matter if we go clear to the west,
and come not through dry-shod?
for wilding brooch shall wet your breast
the rain-fresh goldenrod
oh, never this whelming east wind swells
but it seems like the seas return
to the ancient lands where it left the shells
before the age of the fern
and it seems like the time when after doubt
our love came back amain
oh, come forth into the storm and rout
and be my love in the rain
a minor bird
i have wished a bird would fly away,
and not sing by my house all day
have clapped my hands at him from the door
when it seemed as if i could bear no more
the fault must partly have been in me
the bird was not to blame for his key
and of course there must be something wrong
in wanting to silence any song
a patch of old snow
theres a patch of old snow in a corner
that i should have guessed
was a blow-away paper the rain
had brought to rest
it is speckled with grime as if
small print overspread it,
the news of a day ive forgotten --
if i ever read it
a prayer in spring
oh, give us pleasure in the flowers to-day
and give us not to think so far away
as the uncertain harvest keep us here
all simply in the springing of the year
oh, give us pleasure in the orchard white,
like nothing else by day, like ghosts by night
and make us happy in the happy bees,
the swarm dilating round the perfect trees
and make us happy in the darting bird
that suddenly above the bees is heard,
the meteor that thrusts in with needle bill,
and off a blossom in mid air stands still
for this is love and nothing else is love,
the which it is reserved for god above
to sanctify to what far ends he will,
but which it only needs that we fulfil
a question
a voice said, look me in the stars
and tell me truly, men of earth,
if all the soul-and-body scars
were not too much to pay for birth
a servant to servants
i didnt make you know how glad i was
to have you come and camp here on our land
i promised myself to get down some day
and see the way you lived, but i dont know
with a houseful of hungry men to feed
i guess youd find it seems to me
i cant express my feelings any more
than i can raise my voice or want to lift
my hand oh, i can lift it when i have to
did ever you feel so? i hope you never
its got so i dont even know for sure
whether i am glad, sorry, or anything
theres nothing but a voice-like left inside
that seems to tell me how i ought to feel,
and would feel if i wasnt all gone wrong
you take the lake i look and look at it
i see its a fair, pretty sheet of water
i stand and make myself repeat out loud
the advantages it has, so long and narrow,
like a deep piece of some old running river
cut short off at both ends it lies five miles
straight away through the mountain notch
from the sink window where i wash the plates,
and all our storms come up toward the house,
drawing the slow waves whiter and whiter and whiter
it took my mind off doughnuts and soda biscuit
to step outdoors and take the water dazzle
a sunny morning, or take the rising wind
about my face and body and through my wrapper,
when a storm threatened from the dragons den,
and a cold chill shivered across the lake
i see its a fair, pretty sheet of water,
our willoughby how did you hear of it?
i expect, though, everyones heard of it
in a book about ferns? listen to that
you let things more like feathers regulate
your going and coming and you like it here?
i can see how you might but i dont know
it would be different if more people came,
for then there would be business as it is,
the cottages len built, sometimes we rent them,
sometimes we dont weve a good piece of shore
that ought to be worth something, and may yet
but i dont count on it as much as len
he looks on the bright side of everything,
including me he thinks ill be all right
with doctoring but its not medicine--
lowe is the only doctors dared to say so--
its rest i want--there, i have said it out--
from cooking meals for hungry hired men
and washing dishes after them--from doing
things over and over that just wont stay done
by good rights i ought not to have so much
put on me, but there seems no other way
len says one steady pull more ought to do it
he says the best way out is always through
and i agree to that, or in so far
as that i can see no way out but through--
leastways for me--and then theyll be convinced
its not that len dont want the best for me
it was his plan our moving over in
beside the lake from where that day i showed you
we used to live--ten miles from anywhere
we didnt change without some sacrifice,
but len went at it to make up the loss
his works a mans, of course, from sun to sun,
but he works when he works as hard as i do--
though theres small profit in comparisons
women and men will make them all the same
but work aint all len undertakes too much
hes into everything in town this year
its highways, and hes got too many men
around him to look after that make waste
they take advantage of him shamefully,
and proud, too, of themselves for doing so
we have four here to board, great good-for-nothings,
sprawling about the kitchen with their talk
while i fry their bacon much they care
no more put out in what they do or say
than if i wasnt in the room at all
coming and going all the time, they are
i dont learn what their names are, let alone
their characters, or whether they are safe
to have inside the house with doors unlocked
im not afraid of them, though, if theyre not
afraid of me theres two can play at that
i have my fancies it runs in the family
my fathers brother wasnt right they kept him
locked up for years back there at the old farm
ive been away once--yes, ive been away
the state asylum i was prejudiced
i wouldnt have sent anyone of mine there
you know the old idea--the only asylum
was the poorhouse, and those who could afford,
rather than send their folks to such a place,
kept them at home and it does seem more human
but its not so the place is the asylum
there they have every means proper to do with,
and you arent darkening other peoples lives--
worse than no good to them, and they no good
to you in your condition you cant know
affection or the want of it in that state
ive heard too much of the old-fashioned way
my fathers brother, he went mad quite young
some thought he had been bitten by a dog,
because his violence took on the form
of carrying his pillow in his teeth
but its more likely he was crossed in love,
or so the story goes it was some girl
anyway all he talked about was love
they soon saw he would do someone a mischief
if he want kept strict watch of, and it ended
in fathers building him a sort of cage,
or room within a room, of hickory poles,
like stanchions in the barn, from floor to ceiling,--
a narrow passage all the way around
anything they put in for furniture
hed tear to pieces, even a bed to lie on
so they made the place comfortable with straw,
like a beasts stall, to ease their consciences
of course they had to feed him without dishes
they tried to keep him clothed, but he paraded
with his clothes on his arm--all of his clothes
cruel--it sounds i spose they did the best
they knew and just when he was at the height,
father and mother married, and mother came,
a bride, to help take care of such a creature,
and accommodate her young life to his
that was what marrying father meant to her
she had to lie and hear love things made dreadful
by his shouts in the night hed shout and shout
until the strength was shouted out of him,
and his voice died down slowly from exhaustion
hed pull his bars apart like bow and bow-string,
and let them go and make them twang until
his hands had worn them smooth as any ox-bow
and then hed crow as if he thought that childs play--
the only fun he had ive heard them say, though,
they found a way to put a stop to it
he was before my time--i never saw him
but the pen stayed exactly as it was
there in the upper chamber in the ell,
a sort of catch-all full of attic clutter
i often think of the smooth hickory bars
it got so i would say--you know, half fooling--
its time i took my turn upstairs in jail--
just as you will till it becomes a habit
no wonder i was glad to get away
mind you, i waited till len said the word
i didnt want the blame if things went wrong
i was glad though, no end, when we moved out,
and i looked to be happy, and i was,
as i said, for a while--but i dont know
somehow the change wore out like a prescription
and theres more to it than just window-views
and living by a lake im past such help--
unless len took the notion, which he wont,
and i wont ask him--its not sure enough
i spose ive got to go the road im going
other folks have to, and why shouldnt i?
i almost think if i could do like you,
drop everything and live out on the ground--
but it might be, come night, i shouldnt like it,
or a long rain i should soon get enough,
and be glad of a good roof overhead
ive lain awake thinking of you, ill warrant,
more than you have yourself, some of these nights
the wonder was the tents werent snatched away
from over you as you lay in your beds
i havent courage for a risk like that
bless you, of course, youre keeping me from work,
but the thing of it is, i need to be kept
theres work enough to do--theres always that
but behinds behind the worst that you can do
is set me back a little more behind
i shant catch up in this world, anyway
id rather youd not go unless you must
a soldier
he is that fallen lance that lies as hurled,
that lies unlifted now, come dew, come rust,
but still lies pointed as it plowed the dust
if we who sight along it round the world,
see nothing worthy to have been its mark,
it is because like men we look too near,
forgetting that as fitted to the sphere,
our missiles always make too short an arc
they fall, they rip the grass, they intersect
the curve of earth, and striking, break their own
they make us cringe for metal-point on stone
but this we know, the obstacle that checked
and tripped the body, shot the spirit on
further than target ever showed or shone
a time to talk
when a friend calls to me from the road
and slows his horse to a meaning walk,
i dont stand still and look around
on all the hills i havent hoed,
and shout from where i am, what is it?
no, not as there is a time to talk
i thrust my hoe in the mellow ground,
blade-end up and five feet tall,
and plod i go up to the stone wall
for a friendly visit
acquainted with the night
i have been one acquainted with the night
i have walked out in rain -- and back in rain
i have outwalked the furthest city light
i have looked down the saddest city lane
i have passed by the watchman on his beat
and dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain
i have stood still and stopped the sound of feet
when far away an interrupted cry
came over houses from another street,
but not to call me back or say good-bye
and further still at an unearthly height,
a luminary clock against the sky
proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right
i have been one acquainted with the night
after apple picking
my long two-pointed ladders sticking through a tree
toward heaven still
and theres a barrel that i didnt fill
beside it, and there may be two or three
apples i didnt pick upon some bough
but i am done with apple-picking now
essence of winter sleep is on the night,
the scent of apples i am drowsing off
i cannot shake the shimmer from my sight
i got from looking through a pane of glass
i skimmed this morning from the water-trough,
and held against the world of hoary grass
it melted, and i let it fall and break
but i was well
upon my way to sleep before it fell,
and i could tell
what form my dreaming was about to take
magnified apples appear and reappear,
stem end and blossom end,
and every fleck of russet showing clear
my instep arch not only keeps the ache,
it keeps the pressure of a ladder-round
and i keep hearing from the cellar-bin
that rumbling sound
of load on load of apples coming in
for i have had too much
of apple-picking i am overtired
of the great harvest i myself desired
there were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch,
cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall,
for all
that struck the earth,
no matter if not bruised, or spiked with stubble,
went surely to the cider-apple heap
as of no worth
one can see what will trouble
this sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is
were he not gone,
the woodchuck could say whether its like his
long sleep, as i describe its coming on,
or just some human sleep
after apple-picking
my long two-pointed ladders sticking through a tree
toward heaven still,
and theres a barrel that i didnt fill
beside it, and there may be two or three
apples i didnt pick upon some bough
but i am done with apple-picking now
essence of winter sleep is on the night,
the scent of apples i am drowsing off
i cannot rub the strangeness from my sight
i got from looking through a pane of glass
i skimmed this morning from the drinking trough
and held against the world of hoary grass
it melted, and i let it fall and break
but i was well
upon my way to sleep before it fell,
and i could tell
what form my dreaming was about to take
magnified apples appear and disappear,
stem end and blossom end,
and every fleck of russet showing clear
my instep arch not only keeps the ache,
it keeps the pressure of a ladder-round
i feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend
and i keep hearing from the cellar bin
the rumbling sound
of load on load of apples coming in
for i have had too much
of apple-picking i am overtired
of the great harvest i myself desired
there were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch,
cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall
for all
that struck the earth,
no matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble,
went surely to the cider-apple heap
as of no worth
one can see what will trouble
this sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is
were he not gone,
the woodchuck could say whether its like his
long sleep, as i describe its coming on,
or just some human sleep
an old mans winter night
all out of doors looked darkly in at him
through the thin frost, almost in separate stars,
that gathers on the pane in empty rooms
what kept his eyes from giving back the gaze
was the lamp tilted near them in his hand
what kept him from remembering what it was
that brought him to that creaking room was age
he stood with barrels round him -- at a loss
and having scared the cellar under him
in clomping there, he scared it once again
in clomping off -- and scared the outer night,
which has its sounds, familiar, like the roar
of trees and crack of branches, common things,
but nothing so like beating on a box
a light he was to no one but himself
where now he sat, concerned with he knew what,
a quiet light, and then not even that
he consigned to the moon, such as she was,
so late-arising, to the broken moon
as better than the sun in any case
for such a charge, his snow upon the roof,
his icicles along the wall to keep
and slept the log that shifted with a jolt
once in the stove, disturbed him and he shifted,
and eased his heavy breathing, but still slept
one aged man -- one man -- cant keep a house,
a farm, a countryside, or if he can,
its thus he does it of a winter night
asking for roses
a house that lacks, seemingly, mistress and master,
with doors that none but the wind ever closes,
its floor all littered with glass and with plaster
it stands in a garden of old-fashioned roses
i pass by that way in the gloaming with mary
i wonder, i say, who the owner of those is
oh, no one you know, she answers me airy,
but one we must ask if we want any roses
so we must join hands in the dew coming coldly
there in the hush of the wood that reposes,
and turn and go up to the open door boldly,
and knock to the echoes as beggars for roses
pray, are you within there, mistress who-were-you?
tis mary that speaks and our errand discloses
pray, are you within there? bestir you, bestir you
tis summer again theres two come for roses
a word with you, that of the singer recalling--
old herrick a saying that every maid knows is
a flower unplucked is but left to the falling,
and nothing is gained by not gathering roses
we do not loosen our hands intertwining
not caring so very much what she supposes,
there when she comes on us mistily shining
and grants us by silence the boon of her roses
bereft
where had i heard this wind before
change like this to a deeper roar?
what would it take my standing there for,
holding open a restive door,
looking down hill to a frothy shore?
summer was past and the day was past
sombre clouds in the west were massed
out on the porchs sagging floor,
leaves got up in a coil and hissed,
blindly striking at my knee and missed
something sinister in the tone
told me my secret my be known
word i was in the house alone
somehow must have gotten abroad,
word i was in my life alone,
word i had no one left but god
birches
when i see birches bend to left and right
across the lines of straighter darker trees,
i like to think some boys been swinging them
but swinging doesnt bend them down to stay
ice-storms do that often you must have seen them
loaded with ice a sunny winter morning
after a rain they click upon themselves
as the breeze rises, and turn many-coloured
as the stir cracks and crazes their enamel
soon the suns warmth makes them shed crystal shells
shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust
such heaps of broken glass to sweep away
youd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen
they are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,
and they seem not to break though once they are bowed
so low for long, they never right themselves
you may see their trunks arching in the woods
years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground,
like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair
before them over their heads to dry in the sun
but i was going to say when truth broke in
with all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm,
i should prefer to have some boy bend them
as he went out and in to fetch the cows--
some boy too far from town to learn baseball,
whose only play was what he found himself,
summer or winter, and could play alone
one by one he subdued his fathers trees
by riding them down over and over again
until he took the stiffness out of them,
and not one but hung limp, not one was left
for him to conquer he learned all there was
to learn about not launching out too soon
and so not carrying the tree away
clear to the ground he always kept his poise
to the top branches, climbing carefully
with the same pains you use to fill a cup
up to the brim, and even above the brim
then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,
kicking his way down through the air to the ground
so was i once myself a swinger of birches
and so i dream of going back to be
its when im weary of considerations,
and life is too much like a pathless wood
where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs
broken across it, and one eye is weeping
from a twigs having lashed across it open
id like to get away from earth awhile
and then come back to it and begin over
may no fate willfully misunderstand me
and half grant what i wish and snatch me away
not to return earths the right place for love
i dont know where its likely to go better
id like to go by climbing a birch tree
and climb black branches up a snow-white trunk
toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more,
but dipped its top and set me down again
that would be good both going and coming back
one could do worse than be a swinger of birches
bond and free
love has earth to which she clings
with hills and circling arms about--
wall within wall to shut fear out
but thought has need of no such things,
for thought has a pair of dauntless wings
on snow and sand and turn, i see
where love has left a printed trace
with straining in the worlds embrace
and such is love and glad to be
but thought has shaken his ankles free
thought cleaves the interstellar gloom
and sits in sirius disc all night,
till day makes him retrace his flight
with smell of burning on every plume,
back past the sun to an earthly room
his gains in heaven are what they are
yet some say love by being thrall
and simply staying possesses all
in several beauty that thought fares far
to find fused in another star
but outer space
but outer space,
at least this far,
for all the fuss
of the populace
stays more popular
than populous
come in
as i came to the edge of the woods,
thrush music -- hark
now if it was dusk outside,
inside it was dark
too dark in the woods for a bird
by sleight of wing
to better its perch for the night,
though it still could sing
the last of the light of the sun
that had died in the west
still lived for one song more
in a thrushs breast
far in the pillared dark
thrush music went --
almost like a call to come in
to the dark and lament
but no, i was out for stars
i would not come in
i meant not even if asked
and i hadnt been
desert places
snow falling and night falling fast, oh, fast
in a field i looked into going past,
and the ground almost covered smooth in snow,
but a few weeds and stubble showing last
the woods around it have it - it is theirs
all animals are smothered in their lairs
i am too absent-spirited to count
the loneliness includes me unawares
and lonely as it is, that loneliness
will be more lonely ere it will be less -
a blanker whiteness of benighted snow
with no expression, nothing to express
they cannot scare me with their empty spaces
between stars - on stars where no human race is
i have it in me so much nearer home
to scare myself with my own desert places
design
i found a dimpled spider, fat and white,
on a white heal-all, holding up a moth
like a white piece of rigid satin cloth --
assorted characters of death and blight
mixed ready to begin the morning right,
like the ingredients of a witches broth --
a snow-drop spider, a flower like a froth,
and dead wings carried like a paper kite
what had that flower to do with being white,
the wayside blue and innocent heal-all?
what brought the kindred spider to that height,
then steered the white moth thither in the night?
what but design of darkness to appall?--
if design govern in a thing so small
devotion
the heart can think of no devotion
greater than being shore to ocean -
holding the curve of one position,
counting an endless repetition
dust of snow
the way a crow
shook down on me
the dust of snow
from a hemlock tree
has given my heart
a change of mood
and saved some part
of a day i had rued
evening in a sugar orchard
from where i lingered in a lull in march
outside the sugar-house one night for choice,
i called the fireman with a careful voice
and bade him leave the pan and stoke the arch
o fireman, give the fire another stoke,
and send more sparks up chimney with the smoke
i thought a few might tangle, as they did,
among bare maple boughs, and in the rare
hill atmosphere not cease to glow,
and so be added to the moon up there
the moon, though slight, was moon enough to show
on every tree a bucket with a lid,
and on black ground a bear-skin rug of snow
the sparks made no attempt to be the moon
they were content to figure in the trees
as leo, orion, and the pleiades
and that was what the boughs were full of soon
fire and ice
some say the world will end in fire,
some say in ice
from what ive tasted of desire
i hold with those who favor fire
but if it had to perish twice,
i think i know enough of hate
to say that for destruction ice
is also great
and would suffice
fireflies in the garden
here come real stars to fill the upper skies,
and here on earth come emulating flies,
that though they never equal stars in size,
and they were never really stars at heart
achieve at times a very star-like start
only, of course, they cant sustain the part
flower-gathering
i left you in the morning, and in the morning glow, you walked a way beside me to
make me sad to go do you know me in the gloaming, gaunt and dusty gray with
roaming? are you dumb because you know me not, or dumb because you know? all
for me and not a question for the faded flowers gay that could take me from beside
you for the ages of a day? they are yours, and be the measure of their worth for you
to treasure, the measure of the little while that ive been long away
for once, then something
others taught me with having knelt at well-curbs
always wrong to the light, so never seeing
deeper down in the well than where the water
gives me back in a shining surface picture
me myself in the summer heaven godlike
looking out of a wreath of fern and cloud puffs
once, when trying with chin against a well-curb,
i discerned, as i thought, beyond the picture,
through the picture, a something white, uncertain,
something more of the depths--and then i lost it
water came to rebuke the too clear water
one drop fell from a fern, and lo, a ripple
shook whatever it was lay there at bottom,
blurred it, blotted it out what was that whiteness?
truth? a pebble of quartz? for once, then, something
for once, then, something
others taught me with having knelt at well-curbs
always wrong to the light, so never seeing
deeper down in the well than where the water
gives me back in a shining surface picture
me myself in the summer heaven godlike
looking out of a wreath of fern and cloud puffs
once, when trying with chin against a well-curb,
i discerned, as i thought, beyond the picture,
through the picture, a something white, uncertain,
something more of the depths--and then i lost it
water came to rebuke the too clear water
one drop fell from a fern, and lo, a ripple
shook whatever it was lay there at bottom,
blurred it, blotted it out what was that whiteness?
truth? a pebble of quartz? for once, then, something
fragmentary blue
why make so much of fragmentary blue
in here and there a bird, or butterfly,
or flower, or wearing-stone, or open eye,
when heaven presents in sheets the solid hue?
since earth is earth, perhaps, not heaven as yet--
though some savants make earth include the sky
and blue so far above us comes so high,
it only gives our wish for blue a whet
gathering leaves
spades take up leaves
no better than spoons,
and bags full of leaves
are light as balloons
i make a great noise
of rustling all day
like rabbit and deer
running away
but the mountains i raise
elude my embrace,
flowing over my arms
and into my face
i may load and unload
again and again
till i fill the whole shed,
and what have i then?
next to nothing for weight,
and since they grew duller
from contact with earth,
next to nothing for color
next to nothing for use
but a crop is a crop,
and whos to say where
the harvest shall stop?
ghost house
i dwell in a lonely house i know
that vanished many a summer ago,
and left no trace but the cellar walls,
and a cellar in which the daylight falls,
and the purple-stemmed wild raspberries grow
oer ruined fences the grape-vines shield
the woods come back to the mowing field
the orchard tree has grown one copse
of new wood and old where the woodpecker chops
the footpath down to the well is healed
i dwell with a strangely aching heart
in that vanished abode there far apart
on that disused and forgotten road
that has no dust-bath now for the toad
night comes the black bats tumble and dart
the whippoorwill is coming to shout
and hush and cluck and flutter about
i hear him begin far enough away
full many a time to say his say
before he arrives to say it out
it is under the small, dim, summer star
i know not who these mute folk are
who share the unlit place with me--
those stones out under the low-limbed tree
doubtless bear names that the mosses mar
they are tireless folk, but slow and sad,
though two, close-keeping, are lass and lad,--
with none among them that ever sings,
and yet, in view of how many things,
as sweet companions as might be had
going for water
the well was dry beside the door,
and so we went with pail and can
across the fields behind the house
to seek the brook if still it ran
not loth to have excuse to go,
because the autumn eve was fair
though chill, because the fields were ours,
and by the brook our woods were there
we ran as if to meet the moon
that slowly dawned behind the trees,
the barren boughs without the leaves,
without the birds, without the breeze
but once within the wood, we paused
like gnomes that hid us from the moon,
ready to run to hiding new
with laughter when she found us soon
each laid on other a staying hand
to listen ere we dared to look,
and in the hush we joined to make
we heard, we knew we heard the brook
a note as from a single place,
a slender tinkling fall that made
now drops that floated on the pool
like pearls, and now a silver blade
good-bye, and keep cold
this saying good-bye on the edge of the dark
and cold to an orchard so young in the bark
reminds me of all that can happen to harm
an orchard away at the end of the farm
all winter, cut off by a hill from the house
i dont want it girdled by rabbit and mouse,
i dont want it dreamily nibbled for browse
by deer, and i dont want it budded by grouse
if certain it wouldnt be idle to call
id summon grouse, rabbit, and deer to the wall
and warn them away with a stick for a gun
i dont want it stirred by the heat of the sun
we made it secure against being, i hope,
by setting it out on a northerly slope
no orchards the worse for the wintriest storm
but one thing about it, it mustnt get warm
how often already youve had to be told,
keep cold, young orchard good-bye and keep cold
dread fifty above more than fifty below
i have to be gone for a season or so
my business awhile is with different trees,
less carefully nourished, less fruitful than these,
and such as is done to their wood with an axe--
maples and birches and tamaracks
i wish i could promise to lie in the night
and think of an orchards arboreal plight
when slowly and nobody comes with a light
its heart sinks lower under the sod
but something has to be left to god
hannibal
was there even a cause too lost,
ever a cause that was lost too long,
or that showed with the lapse of time to vain
for the generous tears of youth and song?
home burial
he saw her from the bottom of the stairs
before she saw him she was starting down,
looking back over her shoulder at some fear
she took a doubtful step and then undid it
to raise herself and look again he spoke
advancing toward her what is it you see
from up there always? -- for i want to know
she turned and sank upon her skirts at that,
and her face changed from terrified to dull
he said to gain time what is it you see?
mounting until she cowered under him
i will find out now -- you must tell me, dear
she, in her place, refused him any help,
with the least stiffening of her neck and silence
she let him look, sure that he wouldnt see,
blind creature and a while he didnt see
but at last he murmured, oh and again, oh
what is it -- what? she said
just that i see
you dont, she challenged tell me what it is
the wonder is i didnt see at once
i never noticed it from here before
i must be wonted to it -- thats the reason
the little graveyard where my people are
so small the window frames the whole of it
not so much larger than a bedroom, is it?
there are three stones of slate and one of marble,
broad-shouldered little slabs there in the sunlight
on the sidehill we havent to mind those
but i understand it is not the stones,
but the childs mound ----
dont, dont, dont,
dont, she cried
she withdrew, shrinking from beneath his arm
that rested on the banister, and slid downstairs
and turned on him with such a daunting look,
he said twice over before he knew himself
cant a man speak of his own child hes lost?
not you -- oh, wheres my hat? oh, i dont need it
i must get out of here i must get air--
i dont know rightly whether any man can
amy dont go to someone else this time
listen to me i wont come down the stairs
he sat and fixed his chin between his fists
theres something i should like to ask you, dear
you dont know how to ask it
help me, then
her fingers moved the latch for all reply
my words are nearly always an offense
i dont know how to speak of anything
so as to please you but i might be taught,
i should suppose i cant say i see how
a man must partly give up being a man
with womenfolk we could have some arrangement
by which id bind myself to keep hands off
anything special youre a-mind to name
though i dont like such things twixt those that love
two that dont love cant live together without them
but two that do cant live together with them
she moved the latch a little dont -- dont go
dont carry it to someone else this time
tell me about it if its something human
let me into your grief im not so much
unlike other folks as your standing there
apart would make me out give me my chance
i do think, though, you overdo it a little
what was it brought you up to think it the thing
to take your mother-loss of a first child
so inconsolably -- in the face of love
youd think his memory might be satisfied ----
there you go sneering now
im not, im not
you make me angry ill come down to you
god, what a woman and its come to this,
a man cant speak of his own child thats dead
you cant because you dont know how to speak
if you had any feelings, you that dug
with your own hand -- how could you? -- his little grave
i saw you from that very window there,
making the gravel leap and leap in air,
leap up, like that, like that, and land so lightly
and roll back down the mound beside the hole
i thought, who is that man? i didnt know you
and i crept down the stairs and up the stairs
to look again, and still your spade kept lifting
then you came in i heard your rumbling voice
out in the kitchen, and i dont know why,
but i went near to see with my own eyes
you could sit there with the stains on your shoes
of the fresh earth from your own babys grave
and talk about your everyday concerns
you had stood the spade up against the wall
outside there in the entry, for i saw it
i shall laugh the worst laugh i ever laughed
im cursed god, if i dont believe im cursed
i can repeat the very words you were saying
three foggy mornings and one rainy day
will rot the best birch fence a man can build
think of it, talk like that at such a time
what had how long it takes a birch to rot
to do with what was in the darkened parlour?
you couldnt care the nearest friends can go
with anyone to death, comes so far short
they might as well not try to go at all
no, from the time when one is sick to death,
one is alone, and he dies more alone
friends make pretense of following to the grave,
but before one is in it, their minds are turned
and making the best of their way back to life
and living people, and things they understand
but the worlds evil i wont have grief so
if i can change it oh, i wont, i wont
there, you have said it all and you feel better
you wont go now youre crying close the door
the hearts gone out of it why keep it up?
amyl theres someone coming down the road
you -- oh, you think the talk is all i must go --
somewhere out of this house how can i make you ----
if -- you -- do she was opening the door wider
where do you mean to go? first tell me that
ill follow and bring you back by force i will --
hyla brook
by june our brooks run out of song and speed
sought for much after that, it will be found
either to have gone groping underground
and taken with it all the hyla breed
that shouted in the mist a month ago,
like ghost of sleigh-bells in a ghost of snow--
or flourished and come up in jewel-weed,
weak foliage that is blown upon and bent
even against the way its waters went
its bed is left a faded paper sheet
of dead leaves stuck together by the heat--
a brook to none but who remember long
this as it will be seen is other far
than with brooks taken otherwhere in song
we love the things we love for what they are
in a disused graveyard
the living come with grassy tread
to read the gravestones on the hill
the graveyard draws the living still,
but never anymore the dead
the verses in it say and say
the ones who living come today
to read the stones and go away
tomorrow dead will come to stay
so sure of death the marbles rhyme,
yet cant help marking all the time
how no one dead will seem to come
what is it men are shrinking from?
it would be easy to be clever
and tell the stones men hate to die
and have stopped dying now forever
i think they would believe the lie
in a poem
the sentencing goes blithely on its way
and takes the playfully objected rhyme
as surely as it takes the stroke and time
in having its undeviable say
in hardwood groves
the same leaves over and over again they fall from giving shade above to make one
texture of faded brown and fit the earth like a leather glove before the leaves can
mount again to fill the trees with another shade, they must go down past things
coming up they must go down into the dark decayed they must be pierced by
flowers and put beneath the feet of dancing flowers however it is in some other world
i know that this is way in ours
in neglect
they leave us so to the way we took, as two in whom them were proved mistaken,
that we sit sometimes in the wayside nook, with michievous, vagrant, seraphic look,
and try if we cannot feel forsaken
in white
a dented spider like a snow drop white
on a white heal-all, holding up a moth
like a white piece of lifeless satin cloth -
saw ever curious eye so strange a sight? -
portent in little, assorted death and blight
like the ingredients of a witches broth? -
the beady spider, the flower like a froth,
and the moth carried like a paper kite
what had that flower to do with being white,
the blue prunella every childs delight
what brought the kindred spider to that height?
make we no thesis of the millers plight
what but design of darkness and of night?
design, design do i use the word aright?
into my own
one of my wishes is that those dark trees,
so old and firm they scarcely show the breeze,
were not, as twere, the merest mask of gloom,
but stretched away unto the edge of doom
i should not be withheld but that some day
into their vastness i should steal away,
fearless of ever finding open land,
or highway where the slow wheel pours the sand
i do not see why i should eer turn back,
or those should not set forth upon my track
to overtake me, who should miss me here
and long to know if still i held them dear
they would not find me changed from him they knew--
only more sure of all i though was true
leaves compared with flowers
a trees leaves may be ever so good,
so may its bar, so may its wood
but unless you put the right thing to its root
it never will show much flower or fruit
but i may be one who does not care
ever to have tree bloom or bear
leaves for smooth and bark for rough,
leaves and bark may be tree enough
some giant trees have bloom so small
they might as well have none at all
late in life i have come on fern
now lichens are due to have their turn
i bade men tell me which in brief,
which is fairer, flower or leaf
they did not have the wit to say,
leaves by night and flowers by day
leaves and bar, leaves and bark,
to lean against and hear in the dark
petals i may have once pursued
leaves are all my darker mood
love and a question
a stranger came to the door at eve,
and he spoke the bridegroom fair
he bore a green-white stick in his hand,
and, for all burden, care
he asked with the eyes more than the lips
for a shelter for the night,
and he turned and looked at the road afar
without a window light
the bridegroom came forth into the porch
with, let us look at the sky,
and question what of the night to be,
stranger, you and i
the woodbine leaves littered the yard,
the woodbine berries were blue,
autumn, yes, winter was in the wind
stranger, i wish i knew
within, the bride in the dusk alone
bent over the open fire,
her face rose-red with the glowing coal
and the thought of the hearts desire
the bridegroom looked at the weary road,
yet saw but her within,
and wished her heart in a case of gold
and pinned with a silver pin
the bridegroom thought it little to give
a dole of bread, a purse,
a heartfelt prayer for the poor of god,
or for the rich a curse
but whether or not a man was asked
to mar the love of two
by harboring woe in the bridal house,
the bridegroom wished he knew
meeting and passing
as i went down the hill along the wall
there was a gate i had leaned at for the view
and had just turned from when i first saw you
as you came up the hill we met but all
we did that day was mingle great and small
footprints in summer dust as if we drew
the figure of our being less that two
but more than one as yet your parasol
pointed the decimal off with one deep thrust
and all the time we talked you seemed to see
something down there to smile at in the dust
oh, it was without prejudice to me
afterward i went past what you had passed
before we met and you what i had passed
mending wall
something there is that doesnt love a wall,
that sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,
and spills the upper boulders in the sun
and makes gaps even two can pass abreast
the work of hunters is another thing
i have come after them and made repair
where they have left not one stone on a stone,
but they would have the rabbit out of hiding,
to please the yelping dogs the gaps i mean,
no one has seen them made or heard them made,
but at spring mending-time we find them there
i let my neighbour know beyond the hill
and on a day we meet to walk the line
and set the wall between us once again
we keep the wall between us as we go
to each the boulders that have fallen to each
and some are loaves and some so nearly balls
we have to use a spell to make them balance
stay where you are until our backs are turned
we wear our fingers rough with handling them
oh, just another kind of out-door game,
one on a side it comes to little more
there where it is we do not need the wall
he is all pine and i am apple orchard
my apple trees will never get across
and eat the cones under his pines, i tell him
he only says, good fences make good neighbours
spring is the mischief in me, and i wonder
if i could put a notion in his head
why do they make good neighbours? isnt it
where there are cows? but here there are no cows
before i built a wall id ask to know
what i was walling in or walling out,
and to whom i was like to give offence
something there is that doesnt love a wall,
that wants it down i could say elves to him,
but its not elves exactly, and id rather
he said it for himself i see him there
bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top
in each hand, like an old-stone savage armed
he moves in darkness as it seems to me,
not of woods only and the shade of trees
he will not go behind his fathers saying,
and he likes having thought of it so well
he says again, good fences make good neighbours
mowing
there was never a sound beside the wood but one,
and that was my long scythe whispering to the ground
what was it it whispered? i knew not well myself
perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun,
something, perhaps, about the lack of sound--
and that was why it whispered and did not speak
it was no dream of the gift of idle hours,
or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf
anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak
to the earnest love that laid the swale in rows,
not without feeble-pointed spikes of flowers
pale orchises, and scared a bright green snake
the fact is the sweetest dream that labour knows
my long scythe whispered and left the hay to make
my butterfly
thine emulous fond flowers are dead, too, and the daft sun-assaulter, he that
frightened thee so oft, is fled or dead save only me nor is it sad to thee save only
me there is none left to mourn thee in the fields
my november guest
my sorrow, when shes here with me,
thinks these dark days of autumn rain
are beautiful as days can be
she loves the bare, the withered tree
she walks the sodden pasture lane
her pleasure will not let me stay
she talks and i am fain to list
shes glad the birds are gone away,
shes glad her simple worsted grey
is silver now with clinging mist
the desolate, deserted trees,
the faded earth, the heavy sky,
the beauties she so truly sees,
she thinks i have no eye for these,
and vexes me for reason why
not yesterday i learned to know
the love of bare november days
before the coming of the snow,
but it were vain to tell her so,
and they are better for her praise
neither out far nor in deep
the people along the sand
all turn and look one way
they turn their back on the land
they look at the sea all day
as long as it takes to pass
a ship keeps raising its hull
the wetter ground like glass
reflects a standing gull
the land may vary more
but wherever the truth may be--
the water comes ashore,
and the people look at the sea
they cannot look out far
they cannot look in deep
btu when was that ever a bar
to any watch they keep?
never again would birds song be the same
he would declare and could himself believe
that the birds there in all the garden round
from having heard the daylong voice of eve
had added to their own an oversound,
her tone of meaning but without the words
admittedly an eloquence so soft
could only have had an influence on birds
when call or laughter carried it aloft
be that as may be, she was in their song
moreover her voice upon their voices crossed
had now persisted in the woods so long
that probably it never would be lost
never again would birds song be the same
and to do that to birds was why she came
not to keep
they sent him back to her the letter came
saying and she could have him and before
she could be sure there was no hidden ill
under the formal writing, he was in her sight,
living they gave him back to her alive
how else? they are not known to send the dead
and not disfigured visibly his face?
his hands? she had to look, and ask,
what was it, dear? and she had given all
and still she had all they had they the lucky
wasnt she glad now? everything seemed won,
and all the rest for them permissible ease
she had to ask, what was it, dear?
enough,
yet not enough a bullet through and through,
high in the breast nothing but what good care
and medicine and rest, and you a week,
can cure me of to go again the same
grim giving to do over for them both
she dared no more than ask him with her eyes
how was it with him for a second trial
and with his eyes he asked her not to ask
they had given him back to her, but not to keep
nothing gold can stay
natures first green is gold,
her hardest hue to hold
her early leafs a flower
but only so an hour
then leaf subsides to leaf,
so eden sank to grief,
so dawn goes down to day
nothing gold can stay
now close the windows
now close the windows and hush all the fields
if the trees must, let them silently toss
no bird is singing now, and if there is,
be it my loss
it will be long ere the marshes resume,
i will be long ere the earliest bird
so close the windows and not hear the wind,
but see all wind-stirred
october
o hushed october morning mild, thy leaves have ripened to the fall tomorrows wind,
if it be wild, should waste them all the crows above the forest call tomorrow they
may form and go o hushed october morning mild, begin the hours of this day slow
make the day seem to us less brief hearts not averse to being beguiled, beguile us in
the way you know release one leaf at break of day at noon release another leaf one
from our trees, one far away retard the sun with gentle mist enchant the land with
amethyst slow, slow for the grapes sake, if the were all, whose elaves already are
burnt with frost, whose clustered fruit must else be lost-- for the grapes sake along
the all
on a tree fallen across the road
to hear us talk
the tree the tempest with a crash of wood
throws down in front of us is not bar
our passage to our journeys end for good,
but just to ask us who we think we are
insisting always on our own way so
she likes to halt us in our runner tracks,
and make us get down in a foot of snow
debating what to do without an ax
and yet she knows obstruction is in vain
we will not be put off the final goal
we have it hidden in us to attain,
not though we have to seize earth by the pole
and, tired of aimless circling in one place,
steer straight off after something into space
on looking up by chance at the constellations
youll wait a long, long time for anything much
to happen in heaven beyond the floats of cloud
and the northern lights that run like tingling nerves
the sun and moon get crossed, but they never touch,
nor strike out fire from each other nor crash out loud
the planets seem to interfere in their curves -
but nothing ever happens, no harm is done
we may as well go patiently on with our life,
and look elsewhere than to stars and moon and sun
for the shocks and changes we need to keep us sane
it is true the longest drout will end in rain,
the longest peace in china will end in strife
still it wouldnt reward the watcher to stay awake
in hopes of seeing the calm of heaven break
on his particular time and personal sight
that calm seems certainly safe to last to-night
once by the pacific
the shattered water made a misty din
great waves looked over others coming in,
and thought of doing something to the shore
that water never did to land before
the clouds were low and hairy in the skies,
like locks blown forward in the gleam of eyes
you could not tell, and yet it looked as if
the shore was lucky in being backed by cliff,
the cliff in being backed by continent
it looked as if a night of dark intent
was coming, and not only a night, an age
someone had better be prepared for rage
there would be more than ocean-water broken
before gods last put out the light was spoken
one step backward taken
not only sands and gravels
were once more on their travels,
but gulping muddy gallons
great boulders off their balance
bumped heads together dully
and started down the gully
whole capes caked off in slices
i felt my standpoint shaken
in the universal crisis
but with one step backward taken
i saved myself from going
a world torn loose went by me
then the rain stopped and the blowing,
and the sun came out to dry me
out, out
the buzz-saw snarled and rattled in the yard
and made dust and dropped stove-length sticks of wood,
sweet-scented stuff when the breeze drew across it
and from there those that lifted eyes could count
five mountain ranges one behind the other
under the sunset far into vermont
and the saw snarled and rattled, snarled and rattled,
as it ran light, or had to bear a load
and nothing happened day was all but done
call it a day, i wish they might have said
to please the boy by giving him the half hour
that a boy counts so much when saved from work
his sister stood beside them in her apron
to tell them supper at that word, the saw,
as if to prove saws knew what supper meant,
leaped out at the boys hand, or seemed to leap -
he must have given the hand however it was,
neither refused the meeting but the hand
the boys first outcry was a rueful laugh,
as he swung toward them holding up the hand
half in appeal, but half as if to keep
the life from spilling then the boy saw all -
since he was old enough to know, big boy
doing a mans work, though a child at heart -
he saw all spoiled dont let him cut my hand off -
the doctor, when he comes dont let him, sister
so but the hand was gone already
the doctor put him in the dark of ether
he lay and puffed his lips out with his breath
and then - the watcher at his pulse took fright
no one believed they listened at his heart
little - less - nothing - and that ended it
no more to build on there and they, since they
were not the one dead, turned to their affairs
out, out--
the buzz-saw snarled and rattled in the yard
and made dust and dropped stove-length sticks of wood,
sweet-scented stuff when the breeze drew across it
and from there those that lifted eyes could count
five mountain ranges one behind the other
under the sunset far into vermont

pan with us
pan came out of the woods one day,-- his skin and his hair and his eyes were gray,
the gray of the moss of walls were they,-- and stood in the sun and looked his fill at
wooded valley and wooded hill
plowmen
a plow, they say, to plow the snow
they cannot mean to plant it, no --
unless in bitterness to mock
at having cultivated rock
provide, provide
the witch that came the withered hag
to wash the steps with pail and rag,
was once the beauty abishag,
the picture pride of hollywood
too many fall from great and good
for you to doubt the likelihood
die early and avoid the fate
or if predestined to die late,
make up your mind to die in state
make the whole stock exchange your own
if need be occupy a throne,
where nobody can call you crone
some have relied on what they knew
others on simply being true
what worked for them might work for you
no memory of having starred
atones for later disregard,
or keeps the end from being hard
better to go down dignified
with boughten friendship at your side
than none at all provide, provide
putting in the seed
you come to fetch me from my work to-night
when suppers on the table, and well see
if i can leave off burying the white
soft petals fallen from the apple tree
soft petals, yes, but not so barren quite,
mingled with these, smooth bean and wrinkled pea
and go along with you ere you lose sight
of what you came for and become like me,
slave to a springtime passion for the earth
how love burns through the putting in the seed
on through the watching for that early birth
when, just as the soil tarnishes with weed,
the sturdy seedling with arched body comes
shouldering its way and shedding the earth crumbs
range-finding
the battle rent a cobweb diamond-strung
and cut a flower beside a ground birds nest
before it stained a single human breast
the stricken flower bent double and so hung
and still the bird revisited her young
a butterfly its fall had dispossessed
a moment sought in air his flower of rest,
then lightly stooped to it and fluttering clung
on the bare upland pasture there had spread
oernight twixt mullein stalks a wheel of thread
and straining cables wet with silver dew
a sudden passing bullet shook it dry
the indwelling spider ran to greet the fly,
but finding nothing, sullenly withdrew
reluctance
out through the fields and the woods and over the walls i have wended i have
climbed the hills of view and looked at the world, and descended i have come by the
highway home, and lo, it is ended the leaves are all dead on the group, save those
that the oak is keeping to ravel them one by one and let them go scraping and
creeping out over the crusted snow, when others are sleeping and the dead leaves
lie huddled and still, no longer blown hither and thither the last long aster is gone
the flowers of the witch-hazel wither the heart is still aching to seek, but the feel
question whither? ah, when to the heart of man was it ever less than a treason to
go with the drift of things, to yield with a grace to reason, and bow and accept the end
of a love or a season?
revelation
we make ourselves a place apart
behind light words that tease and flout,
but oh, the agitated heart
till someone find us really out
tis pity if the case require
or so we say that in the end
we speak the literal to inspire
the understanding of a friend
but so with all, from babes that play
at hide-and-seek to god afar,
so all who hide too well away
must speak and tell us where they are
rose pogonias
a saturated meadow,
sun-shaped and jewel-small,
a circle scarcely wider
than the trees around were tall
where winds were quite excluded,
and the air was stifling sweet
with the breath of many flowers, --
a temple of the heat
there we bowed us in the burning,
as the suns right worship is,
to pick where none could miss them
a thousand orchises
for though the grass was scattered,
yet every second spear
seemed tipped with wings of color,
that tinged the atmosphere
we raised a simple prayer
before we left the spot,
that in the general mowing
that place might be forgot
or if not all so favored,
obtain such grace of hours,
that none should mow the grass there
while so confused with flowers
spring pools
these pools that, though in forests, still reflect
the total sky almost without defect,
and like the flowers beside them, chill and shiver,
will like the flowers beside them soon be gone,
and yet not out by any brook or river,
but up by roots to bring dark foliage on
the trees that have it in their pent-up buds
to darken nature and be summer woods -
let them think twice before they use their powers
to blot out and drink up and sweep away
these flowery waters and these watery flowers
from snow that melted only yesterday
stars
how countlessly they congregate
oer our tumultuous snow,
which flows in shapes as tall as trees
when wintry winds do blow--
as if with keenness for our fate,
our faltering few steps on
to white rest, and a place of rest
invisible at dawn,--
and yet with neither love nor hate,
those stars like some snow-white
minervas snow-white marble eyes
without the gift of sight
stopping by woods on a snowy evening
whose woods these are i think i know
his house is in the village, though
he will not see me stopping here
to watch his woods fill up with snow
my little horse must think it queer
to stop without a farmhouse near
between the woods and frozen lake
the darkest evening of the year
he gives his harness bells a shake
to ask if there is some mistake
the only other sounds the sweep
of easy wind and downy flake
the woods are lovely, dark, and deep,
but i have promises to keep,
and miles to go before i sleep,
and miles to go before i sleep
the aim was song
before man to blow to right
the wind once blew itself untaught,
and did its loudest day and night
in any rough place where it caught
man came to tell it what was wrong
it hadnt found the place to blow
it blew too hard - the aim was song
and listen - how it ought to go
he took a little in his mouth,
and held it long enough for north
to be converted into south,
and then by measure blew it forth
by measure it was word and note,
the wind the wind had meant to be -
a little through the lips and throat
the aim was song - the wind could see
the armful
for every parcel i stoop down to seize
i lose some other off my arms and knees,
and the whole pile is slipping, bottles, buns --
extremes too hard to comprehend at once,
yet nothing i should care to leave behind
with all i have to hold with hand and mind
and heart, if need be, i will do my best
to keep their building balanced at my breast
i crouch down to prevent them as they fall
then sit down in the middle of them all
i had to drop the armful in the road
and try to stack them in a better load
the bear
the bear puts both arms around the tree above her
and draws it down as if it were a lover
and its chokecherries lips to kiss good-by,
then lets it snap back upright in the sky
her next step rocks a boulder on the wall
shes making her cross-country in the fall
her great weight creaks the barbed wire in its staples
as she flings over and off down through the maples,
leaving on one wire tooth a lock of hair
such is the uncaged progress of the bear
the world has room to make a bear feel free
the universe seems cramped to you and me
man acts more like the poor bear in a cage,
that all day fights a nervous inward rage,
his mood rejecting all his mind suggests
he paces back and forth and never rests
the me-nail click and shuffle of his feet,
the telescope at one end of his beat,
and at the other end the microscope,
two instruments of nearly equal hope,
and in conjunction giving quite a spread
or if he rests from scientific tread,
tis only to sit back and sway his head
through ninety-odd degrees of arc, it seems,
between two metaphysical extremes
he sits back on his fundamental butt
with lifted snout and eyes if any shut
he almost looks religious but hes not,
and back and forth he sways from cheek to cheek,
at one extreme agreeing with one greek
at the other agreeing with another greek
which may be thought, but only so to speak
a baggy figure, equally pathetic
when sedentary and when peripatetic
the cow in apple-time
something inspires the only cow of late
to make no more of a wall than an open gate,
and think no more of wall-builders than fools
her face is flecked with pomace and she drools
a cider syrup having tasted fruit,
she scorns a pasture withering to the root
she runs from tree to tree where lie and sweeten
the windfalls spiked with stubble and worm-eaten
she leaves them bitten when she has to fly
she bellows on a knoll against the sky
her udder shrivels and the milk goes dry
the death of the hired man
mary sat musing on the lamp-flame at the table
waiting for warren when she heard his step,
she ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage
to meet him in the doorway with the news
and put him on his guard silas is back
she pushed him outward with her through the door
and shut it after her be kind, she said
she took the market things from warrens arms
and set them on the porch, then drew him down
to sit beside her on the wooden steps
when was i ever anything but kind to him?
but ill not have the fellow back, he said
i told him so last haying, didnt i?
if he left then, i said, that ended it
what good is he? who else will harbour him
at his age for the little he can do?
what help he is theres no depending on
off he goes always when i need him most
he thinks he ought to earn a little pay,
enough at least to buy tobacco with,
so he wont have to beg and be beholden
all right, i say, i cant afford to pay
any fixed wages, though i wish i could
someone else can then someone else will have to
i shouldnt mind his bettering himself
if that was what it was you can be certain,
when he begins like that, theres someone at him
trying to coax him off with pocket-money,--
in haying time, when any help is scarce
in winter he comes back to us im done
sh not so loud hell hear you, mary said
i want him to hell have to soon or late
hes worn out hes asleep beside the stove
when i came up from rowes i found him here,
huddled against the barn-door fast asleep,
a miserable sight, and frightening, too--
you neednt smile--i didnt recognise him--
i wasnt looking for him--and hes changed
wait till you see
where did you say hed been?
he didnt say i dragged him to the house,
and gave him tea and tried to make him smoke
i tried to make him talk about his travels
nothing would do he just kept nodding off
what did he say? did he say anything?
but little
anything? mary, confess
he said hed come to ditch the meadow for me
warren
but did he? i just want to know
of course he did what would you have him say?
surely you wouldnt grudge the poor old man
some humble way to save his self-respect
he added, if you really care to know,
he meant to clear the upper pasture, too
that sounds like something you have heard before?
warren, i wish you could have heard the way
he jumbled everything i stopped to look
two or three times--he made me feel so queer--
to see if he was talking in his sleep
he ran on harold wilson--you remember--
the boy you had in haying four years since
hes finished school, and teaching in his college
silas declares youll have to get him back
he says they two will make a team for work
between them they will lay this farm as smooth
the way he mixed that in with other things
he thinks young wilson a likely lad, though daft
on education--you know how they fought
all through july under the blazing sun,
silas up on the cart to build the load,
harold along beside to pitch it on
yes, i took care to keep well out of earshot
well, those days trouble silas like a dream
you wouldnt think they would how some things linger
harolds young college boys assurance piqued him
after so many years he still keeps finding
good arguments he sees he might have used
i sympathise i know just how it feels
to think of the right thing to say too late
harolds associated in his mind with latin
he asked me what i thought of harolds saying
he studied latin like the violin
because he liked it--that an argument
he said he couldnt make the boy believe
he could find water with a hazel prong--
which showed how much good school had ever done him
he wanted to go over that but most of all
he thinks if he could have another chance
to teach him how to build a load of hay----
i know, thats silas one accomplishment
he bundles every forkful in its place,
and tags and numbers it for future reference,
so he can find and easily dislodge it
in the unloading silas does that well
he takes it out in bunches like big birds nests
you never see him standing on the hay
hes trying to lift, straining to lift himself
he thinks if he could teach him that, hed be
some good perhaps to someone in the world
he hates to see a boy the fool of books
poor silas, so concerned for other folk,
and nothing to look backward to with pride,
and nothing to look forward to with hope,
so now and never any different
part of a moon was falling down the west,
dragging the whole sky with it to the hills
its light poured softly in her lap she saw
and spread her apron to it she put out her hand
among the harp-like morning-glory strings,
taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves,
as if she played unheard the tenderness
that wrought on him beside her in the night
warren, she said, he has come home to die
you neednt be afraid hell leave you this time
home, he mocked gently
yes, what else but home?
it all depends on what you mean by home
of course hes nothing to us, any more
than was the hound that came a stranger to us
out of the woods, worn out upon the trail
home is the place where, when you have to go there,
they have to take you in
i should have called it
something you somehow havent to deserve
warren leaned out and took a step or two,
picked up a little stick, and brought it back
and broke it in his hand and tossed it by
silas has better claim on us you think
than on his brother? thirteen little miles
as the road winds would bring him to his door
silas has walked that far no doubt to-day
why didnt he go there? his brothers rich,
a somebody--director in the bank
he never told us that
we know it though
i think his brother ought to help, of course
ill see to that if there is need he ought of right
to take him in, and might be willing to--
he may be better than appearances
but have some pity on silas do you think
if hed had any pride in claiming kin
or anything he looked for from his brother,
hed keep so still about him all this time?
i wonder whats between them
i can tell you
silas is what he is--we wouldnt mind him--
but just the kind that kinsfolk cant abide
he never did a thing so very bad
he dont know why he isnt quite as good
as anyone he wont be made ashamed
to please his brother, worthless though he is
i cant think si ever hurt anyone
no, but he hurt my heart the way he lay
and rolled his old head on that sharp-edged chair-back
he wouldnt let me put him on the lounge
you must go in and see what you can do
i made the bed up for him there to-night
youll be surprised at him--how much hes broken
his working days are done im sure of it
id not be in a hurry to say that
i havent been go, look, see for yourself
but, warren, please remember how it is
hes come to help you ditch the meadow
he has a plan you mustnt laugh at him
he may not speak of it, and then he may
ill sit and see if that small sailing cloud
will hit or miss the moon
it hit the moon
then there were three there, making a dim row,
the moon, the little silver cloud, and she
warren returned--too soon, it seemed to her,
slipped to her side, caught up her hand and waited
warren, she questioned
dead, was all he answered
the demiurges laugh
it was far in the sameness of the wood
i was running with joy on the demons trail,
though i knew what i hunted was no true god
it was just as the light was beginning to fail
that i suddenly heardall i needed to hear
it has lasted me many and many a year
the sound was behind me instead of before,
a sleepy sound, but mocking half,
as of one who utterly couldnt care
the demon arose from his wallow to laugh,
brushing the dirt from his eye as he went
and well i knew what the demon meant
i shall not forget how his laugh rang out
i felt as a fool to have been so caught,
and checked my steps to make pretence
it was something among the leaves i sought
though doubtful whether he stayed to see
thereafter i sat me against a tree
the exposed nest
you were forever finding some new play
so when i saw you down on hands and knees
i the meadow, busy with the new-cut hay,
trying, i thought, to set it up on end,
i went to show you how to make it stay,
if that was your idea, against the breeze,
and, if you asked me, even help pretend
to make it root again and grow afresh
but twas no make-believe with you today,
nor was the grass itself your real concern,
though i found your hand full of wilted fern,
steel-bright june-grass, and blackening heads of clovers
twas a nest full of young birds on the ground
the cutter-bar had just gone champing over
miraculously without tasking flesh
and left defenseless to the heat and light
you wanted to restore them to their right
of something interposed between their sight
and too much world at once--could means be found
the way the nest-full every time we stirred
stood up to us as to a mother-bird
whose coming home has been too long deferred,
made me ask would the mother-bird return
and care for them in such a change of scene
and might out meddling make her more afraid
that was a thing we could not wait to learn
we saw the risk we took in doing good,
but dared not spare to do the best we could
though harm should come of it so built the screen
you had begun, and gave them back their shade
all this to prove we cared why is there then
no more to tell? we turned to other things
i havent any memory--have you?--
of ever coming to the place again
to see if the birds lived the first night through,
and so at last to learn to use their wings
the flower boat
the fishermans swapping a yarn for a yarn
under the hand of the village barber,
and her in the angle of house and barn
his deep-sea dory has found a harbor
at anchor she rides the sunny sod
as full to the gunnel of flowers growing
as ever she turned her home with cod
from georges bank when winds were blowing
and i judge from that elysian freight
that all they ask is rougher weather,
and dory and master will sail by fate
to seek the happy isles together
the gift outright
the land was ours before we were the lands
she was our land more than a hundred years
before we were her people she was ours
in massachusetts, in virginia,
but we were englands, still colonials,
possessing what we still were unpossessed by,
possessed by what we now no more possessed
something we were withholding made us weak
until we found out that it was ourselves
we were withholding from our land of living,
and forthwith found salvation in surrender
such as we were we gave ourselves outright
the deed of gift was many deeds of war
to the land vaguely realizing westward,
but still unstoried, artless, unenhanced,
such as she was, such as she would become
the gum-gatherer
there overtook me and drew me in
to his down-hill, early-morning stride,
and set me five miles on my road
better than if he had had me ride,
a man with a swinging bag forload
and half the bag wound round his hand
we talked like barking above the din
of water we walked along beside
and for my telling him where id been
and where i lived in mountain land
to be coming home the way i was,
he told me a little about himself
he came from higher up in the pass
where the grist of the new-beginning brooks
is blocks split off the mountain mass --
and hop eless grist enough it looks
ever to grind to soil for grass
the way it is will do for moss
there he had built his stolen shack
it had to be a stolen shack
because of the fears of fire and logs
that trouble the sleep of lumber folk
visions of half the world burned black
and the sun shrunken yellow in smoke
we know who when they come to town
bring berries under the wagon seat,
or a basket of eggs between their feet
what this man brought in a cotton sack
was gum, the gum of the mountain spruce
he showed me lumps of the scented stuff
like uncut jewels, dull and rough
it comes to market golden brown
but turns to pink between the teeth
i told him this is a pleasant life
to set your breast to the bark of trees
that all your days are dim beneath,
and reaching up with a little knife,
to loose the resin and take it down
and bring it to market when you please
the hill wife
it was too lonely for her there,
and too wild,
and since there were but two of them,
and no child
and work was little in the house,
she was free,
and followed where he furrowed field,
or felled log
she rested on a log and tossed
the fresh chips,
with a song only to herself
on her lips
and once she went to break a bough
of black alder
she strayed so far she scarcely heard
when he called her -
and didnt answer - didnt speak -
or return
she stood, and then she ran and hid
in the fern
he never found her, though he looked
everywhere,
and he asked at her mothers house
was she there
sudden and swift and light as that
the ties gave,
and he learned of finalities
besides the grave
the line-gang
here come the line-gang pioneering by,
they throw a forest down less cut than broken
they plant dead trees for living, and the dead
they string together with a living thread
they string an instrument against the sky
wherein words whether beaten out or spoken
will run as hushed as when they were a thought
but in no hush they string it they go past
with shouts afar to pull the cable taught,
to hold it hard until they make it fast,
to ease away -- they have it with a laugh,
an oath of towns that set the wild at naught
they bring the telephone and telegraph
the lockless door
it went many years,
but at last came a knock,
and i thought of the door
with no lock to lock
i blew out the light,
i tip-toed the floor,
and raised both hands
in prayer to the door
but the knock came again
my window was wide
i climbed on the sill
and descended outside
back over the sill
i bade a come in
to whoever the knock
at the door may have been
so at a knock
i emptied my cage
to hide in the world
and alter with age
the need of being versed in country things
the house had gone to bring again
to the midnight sky a sunset glow
now the chimney was all of the house that stood,
like a pistil after the petals go
the barn opposed across the way,
that would have joined the house in flame
had it been the will of the wind, was left
to bear forsaken the places name
no more it opened with all one end
for teams that came by the stony road
to drum on the floor with scurrying hoofs
and brush the mow with the summer load
the birds that came to it through the air
at broken windows flew out and in,
their murmur more like the sigh we sigh
from too much dwelling on what has been
yet for them the lilac renewed its leaf,
and the aged elm, though touched with fire
and the dry pump flung up an awkward arm
and the fence post carried a strand of wire
for them there was really nothing sad
but though they rejoiced in the nest they kept,
one had to be versed in country things
not to believe the phoebes wept
the oven bird
there is a singer eveyone has heard,
loud, a mid-summer and a mid-wood bird,
who makes the solid tree trunks sound again
he says that leaves are old and that for flowers
mid-summer is to spring as one to ten
he says the early petal-fall is past,
when pear and cherry bloom went down in showers
on sunny days a moment overcast
and comes that other fall we name the fall
he says the highway dust is over all
the bird would cease and be as other birds
but that he knows in singing not to sing
the question that he frames in all but words
is what to make of a diminished thing
the pasture
im going out to clean the pasture spring
ill only stop to rake the leaves away
and wait to watch the water clear, i may
i shant be gone long -- you come too
im going out to fetch the little calf
thats standing by the mother its so young,
it totters when she licks it with her tongue
i shant be gone long -- you come too
the road not taken
two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
and sorry i could not travel both
and be one traveler, long i stood
and looked down one as far as i could
to where it bent in the undergrowth
then took the other, just as fair,
and having perhaps the better claim
because it was grassy and wanted wear,
though as for that the passing there
had worn them really about the same,
and both that morning equally lay
in leaves no step had trodden black
oh, i marked the first for another day
yet knowing how way leads on to way
i doubted if i should ever come back
i shall be telling this with a sigh
somewhere ages and ages hence
two roads diverged in a wood, and i,
i took the one less traveled by,
and that has made all the difference
the rose family
the rose is a rose,
and was always a rose
but the theory now goes
that the apples a rose,
and the pear is, and sos
the plum, i suppose
the dear only knows
what will next prove a rose
you, of course, are a rose -
but were always a rose
the secret sits
we dance round in a ring and suppose,
but the secret sits in the middle and knows
the silken tent
she is as in a field of silken tent
at midday when the sunny summer breeze
has dried the dew and all its ropes relent,
so that in guys it gently sways at ease,
and its supporting central cedar pole,
that is its pinnacle to heavenward
and signifies the sureness of the soul,
seems to owe naught to any single cord,
but strictly held by none, is loosely bound
by countless silken ties of love and thought
to every thing on earth the compass round,
and only by ones going slightly taut
in the capriciousness of summer air
is of the slightlest bondage made aware
the soldier
he is that fallen lance that lies as hurled,
that lies unlifted now, come dew, come rust,
but still lies pointed as it ploughed the dust
if we who sight along it round the world,
see nothing worthy to have been its mark,
it is because like men we look too near,
forgetting that as fitted to the sphere,
our missiles always make too short an arc
they fall, they rip the grass, they intersect
the curve of earth, and striking, break their own
they make us cringe for metal-point on stone
but this we know, the obstacle that checked
and tripped the body, shot the spirit on
further than target ever showed or shone
the sound of trees
i wonder about the trees
why do we wish to bear
forever the noise of these
more than another noise
so close to our dwelling place?
we suffer them by the day
till we lose all measure of pace,
and fixity in our joys,
and acquire a listening air
they are that that talks of going
but never gets away
and that talks no less for knowing,
as it grows wiser and older,
that now it means to stay
my feet tug at the floor
and my head sways to my shoulder
sometimes when i watch trees sway,
from the window or the door
i shall set forth for somewhere,
i shall make the reckless choice
some day when they are in voice
and tossing so as to scare
the white clouds over them on
i shall have less to say,
but i shall be gone
the span of life
the old dog barks backwards without getting up
i can remember when he was a pup
anonymous submission
the star splitter
you know orion always comes up sideways
throwing a leg up over our fence of mountains,
and rising on his hands, he looks in on me
busy outdoors by lantern-light with something
i should have done by daylight, and indeed,
after the ground is frozen, i should have done
before it froze, and a gust flings a handful
of waste leaves at my smoky lantern chimney
to make fun of my way of doing things,
or else fun of orions having caught me
has a man, i should like to ask, no rights
these forces are obliged to pay respect to?
so brad mclaughlin mingled reckless talk
of heavenly stars with hugger-mugger farming,
till having failed at hugger-mugger farming
he burned his house down for the fire insurance
and spent the proceeds on a telescope
to satisfy a lifelong curiosity
about our place among the infinities
what do you want with one of those blame things?
i asked him well beforehand dont you get one
dont call it blamed there isnt anything
more blameless in the sense of being less
a weapon in our human fight, he said
ill have one if i sell my farm to buy it
there where he moved the rocks to plow the ground
and plowed between the rocks he couldnt move,
few farms changed hands so rather than spend years
trying to sell his farm and then not selling,
he burned his house down for the fire insurance
and bought the telescope with what it came to
he had been heard to say by several
the best thing that were put here fors to see
the strongest thing thats given us to see withs
a telescope someone in every town
seems to me owes it to the town to keep one
in littleton it might as well be me
after such loose talk it was no surprise
when he did what he did and burned his house down
mean laughter went about the town that day
to let him know we werent the least imposed on,
and he could wait---wed see to him tomorrow
but the first thing next morning we reflected
if one by one we counted people out
for the least sin, it wouldnt take us long
to get so we had no one left to live with
for to be social is to be forgiving
our thief, the one who does our stealing from us,
we dont cut off from coming to church suppers,
but what we miss we go to him and ask for
he promptly gives it back, that is if still
uneaten, unworn out, or undisposed of
it wouldnt do to be too hard on brad
about his telescope beyond the age
of being given one for christmas gift,
he had to take the best way he knew how
to find himself in one well, all we said was
he took a strange thing to be roguish over
some sympathy was wasted on the house,
a good old-timer dating back along
but a house isnt sentient the house
didnt feel anything and if it did,
why not regard it as a sacrifice,
and an old-fashioned sacrifice by fire,
instead of a new-fashioned one at auction?
out of a house and so out of a farm
at one stroke of a match, brad had to turn
to earn a living on the concord railroad,
as under-ticket-agent at a station
where his job, when he wasnt selling tickets,
was setting out, up track and down, not plants
as on a farm, but planets, evening stars
that varied in their hue from red to green
he got a good glass for six hundred dollars
his new job gave him leisure for stargazing
often he bid me come and have a look
up the brass barrel, velvet black inside,
at a star quaking in the other end
i recollect a night of broken clouds
and underfoot snow melted down to ice,
and melting further in the wind to mud
bradford and i had out the telescope
we spread our two legs as we spread its three,
pointed our thoughts the way we pointed it,
and standing at our leisure till the day broke,
said some of the best things we ever said
that telescope was christened the star-splitter,
because it didnt do a thing but split
a star in two or three, the way you split
a globule of quicksilver in your hand
with one stroke of your finger in the middle
its a star-splitter if there ever was one,
and ought to do some good if splitting stars
sa thing to be compared with splitting wood
weve looked and looked, but after all where are we?
do we know any better where we are,
and how it stands between the night tonight
and a man with a smoky lantern chimney?
how different from the way it ever stood?
the telephone
when i was just as far as i could walk from here today, there was an hour all still
when leaning with my head again a flower i heard you talk dont say i didnt, for i
heard you say-- you spoke from that flower on the window sill- do you remember what
it was you said? first tell me what it was you thought you heard having found the
flower and driven a bee away, i leaned on my head and holding by the stalk, i listened
and i thought i caught the word-- what was it? did you call me by my name? or did
you say-- someone said come -- i heard it as i bowed i may have thought as
much, but not aloud well, so i came
the trial by existence
even the bravest that are slain shall not dissemble their surprise on waking to find
valor reign, even as on earth, in paradise and where they sought without the sword
wide fields of asphodel foreer, to find that the utmost reward of daring should be
still to dare
the tuft of flowers
i went to turn the grass once after one
who mowed it in the dew before the sun
the dew was gone that made his blade so keen
before i came to view the levelled scene
i looked for him behind an isle of trees
i listened for his whetstone on the breeze
but he had gone his way, the grass all mown,
and i must be, as he had been,alone,
as all must be, i said within my heart,
whether they work together or apart
but as i said it, swift there passed me by
on noiseless wing a bewildered butterfly,
seeking with memories grown dim over night
some resting flower of yesterdays delight
and once i marked his flight go round and round,
as where some flower lay withering on the ground
and then he flew as far as eye could see,
and then on tremulous wing came back to me
i thought of questions that have no reply,
and would have turned to toss the grass to dry
but he turned first, and led my eye to look
at a tall tuft of flowers beside a brook,
a leaping tongue of bloom the scythe had spared
beside a reedy brook the scythe had bared
i left my place to know them by their name,
finding them butterfly-weed when i came
the mower in the dew had loved them thus,
by leaving them to flourish, not for us,
nor yet to draw one thought of ours to him,
but from sheer morning gladness at the brim
the butterfly and i had lit upon,
nevertheless, a message from the dawn,
that made me hear the wakening birds around,
and hear his long scythe whispering to the ground,
and feel a spirit kindred to my own
so that henceforth i worked no more alone
but glad with him, i worked as with his aid,
and weary, sought at noon with him the shade
and dreaming, as it were, held brotherly speech
with one whose thought i had not hoped to reach
men work together, i told him from the heart,
whether they work together or apart
the vanishing red
he is said to have been the last red man
in action and the miller is said to have laughed--
if you like to call such a sound a laugh
but he gave no one else a laughers license
for he turned suddenly grave as if to say,
whose business,--if i take it on myself,
whose business--but why talk round the barn?--
when its just that i hold with getting a thing done with
you cant get back and see it as he saw it
its too long a story to go into now
youd have to have been there and lived it
they you wouldnt have looked on it as just a matter
of who began it between the two races
some guttural exclamation of surprise
the red man gave in poking about the mill
over the great big thumping shuffling millstone
disgusted the miller physically as coming
from one who had no right to be heard from
come, john, he said, you want to see the wheel-pint?
he took him down below a cramping rafter,
and showed him, through a manhole in the floor,
the water in desperate straits like frantic fish,
salmon and sturgeon, lashing with their tails
the he shut down the trap door with a ring in it
that jangled even above the general noise,
and came upstairs alone--and gave that laugh,
and said something to a man with a meal-sack
that the man with the meal-sack didnt catch--then
oh, yes, he showed john the wheel-pit all right
the vantage point
if tires of trees i seek again mankind, well i know where to hie me--in the dawn, to a
slope where the cattle keep the lawn there amid loggin juniper reclined, myself
unseen, i see in white defined far off the homes of men, and farther still, the graves
of men on an opposing hill, living or dead, whichever are to mind and if by noon i
have too much of these, i have but to turn on my arm, and lo, the sun-burned hillside
sets my face aglow, my breathing shakes the bluet like a breeze, i smell the earth, i
smell the bruisegraved plant, i look into the crater of the ant
the wood-pile
out walking in the frozen swamp one gray day,
i paused and said, i will turn back from here
no, i will go on farther -- and we shall see
the hard snow held me, save where now and then
one foot went through the view was all in lines
straight up and down of tall slim trees
too much alike to mark or name a place by
so as to say for certain i was here
or somewhere else i was just far from home
a small bird flew before me he was careful
to put a tree between us when he lighted,
and say no word to tell me who he was
who was so foolish as to think what he thought
he thought that i was after him for a feather --
the white one in his tail like one who takes
everything said as personal to himself
one flight out sideways would have undeceived him
and then there was a pile of wood for which
i forgot him and let his little fear
carry him off the way i might have gone,
without so much as wishing him good-night
he went behind it to make his last stand
it was a cord of maple, cut and split
and piled -- and measured, four by four by eight
and not another like it could i see
no runner tracks in this years snow looped near it
and it was older sure than this years cutting,
or even last years or the years before
the wood was gray and the bark warping off it
and the pile somewhat sunken clematis
had wound strings round and round it like a bundle
what held it though on one side was a tree
still growing, and on one a stake and prop,
these latter about to fall i thought that only
someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks
could so forget his handiwork on which
he spent himself, the labor of his ax,
and leave it there far from a useful fireplace
to warm the frozen swamp as best it could
with the slow smokeless burning of decay
they were welcome to their belief
grief may have thought it was grief
care may have thought it was care
they were welcome to their belief,
the overimportant pair
no, it took all the snows that clung
to the low roof over his bed,
beginning when he was young,
to induce the one snow on his head
but whenever the roof camme white
the head in the dark below
was a shade less the color of night,
a shade more the color of snow
grief may have thought it was grief
care may have thought it was care
but neither one was the thief
of his raven color of hair

i slumbered with your poems on my breast
spread open as i dropped them half-read through
like dove wings on a figure on a tomb
to see, if in a dream they brought of you,
i might not have the chance i missed in life
through some delay, and call you to your face
first soldier, and then poet, and then both,
who died a soldier-poet of your race
i meant, you meant, that nothing should remain
unsaid between us, brother, and this remained--
and one thing more that was not then to say
the victory for what it lost and gained
you went to meet the shells embrace of fire
on vimy ridge and when you fell that day
the war seemed over more for you than me,
but now for me than you--the other way
how over, though, for even me who knew
the foe thrust back unsafe beyond the rhine,
if i was not to speak of it to you
and see you pleased once more with words of mine?

if i was not to speak of it to you
and see you pleased once more with words of mine?
to earthward
love at the lips was touch
as sweet as i could bear
and once that seemed too much
i lived on air
that crossed me from sweet things,
the flow of - was it musk
from hidden grapevine springs
down hill at dusk?
i had the swirl and ache
from sprays of honeysuckle
that when theyre gathered shake
dew on the knuckle
i craved strong sweets, but those
seemed strong when i was young
the petal of the rose
it was that stung
now no joy but lacks salt
that is not dashed with pain
and weariness and fault
i crave the stain
of tears, the aftermark
of almost too much love,
the sweet of bitter bark
and burning clove
when stiff and sore and scarred
i take away my hand
from leaning on it hard
in grass and sand,
the hurt is not enough
i long for weight and strength
to feel the earth as rough
to all my length
to the thawing wind
come with rain o loud southwester bring the singer, bring the nester give the
buried flower a dream make the settled snowbank steam find the brown beneath the
white but whateer you do tonight, bath my window, make it flow, melt it as the ice
will go melt the glass and leave the sticks like a hermits crucifix burst into my
narrow stall swing the picture on the wall run the rattling pages oer scatter poems
on the floor turn the poet out of door
tree at my window
tree at my window, window tree,
my sash is lowered when night comes on
but let there never be curtain drawn
between you and me
vague dream head lifted out of the ground,
and thing next most diffuse to cloud,
not all your light tongues talking aloud
could be profound
but tree, i have seen you taken and tossed,
and if you have seen me when i slept,
you have seen me when i was taken and swept
and all but lost
that day she put our heads together,
fate had her imagination about her,
your head so much concerned with outer,
mine with inner, weather
two look at two
love and forgetting might have carried them
a little further up the mountain side
with night so near, but not much further up
they must have halted soon in any case
with thoughts of a path back, how rough it was
with rock and washout, and unsafe in darkness
when they were halted by a tumbled wall
with barbed-wire binding they stood facing this,
spending what onward impulse they still had
in one last look the way they must not go,
on up the failing path, where, if a stone
or earthslide moved at night, it moved itself
no footstep moved it this is all, they sighed,
good-night to woods but not so there was more
a doe from round a spruce stood looking at them
across the wall, as near the wall as they
she saw them in their field, they her in hers
the difficulty of seeing what stood still,
like some up-ended boulder split in two,
was in her clouded eyes they saw no fear there
she seemed to think that two thus they were safe
then, as if they were something that, though strange,
she could not trouble her mind with too long,
she sighed and passed unscared along the wall
this, then, is all what more is there to ask?
but no, not yet a snort to bid them wait
a buck from round the spruce stood looking at them
across the wall as near the wall as they
this was an antlered buck of lusty nostril,
not the same doe come back into her place
he viewed them quizzically with jerks of head,
as if to ask, why dont you make some motion?
or give some sign of life? because you cant
i doubt if youre as living as you look
thus till he had them almost feeling dared
to stretch a proffering hand -- and a spell-breaking
then he too passed unscared along the wall
two had seen two, whichever side you spoke from
this must be all it was all still they stood,
a great wave from it going over them,
as if the earth in one unlooked-for favour
had made them certain earth returned their love
two tramps in mud time
out of the mud two strangers came
and caught me splitting wood in the yard,
and one of them put me off my aim
by hailing cheerily hit them hard
i knew pretty well why he had dropped behind
and let the other go on a way
i knew pretty well what he had in mind
he wanted to take my job for pay
good blocks of oak it was i split,
as large around as the chopping block
and every piece i squarely hit
fell splinterless as a cloven rock
the blows that a life of self-control
spares to strike for the common good,
that day, giving a loose my soul,
i spent on the unimportant wood
the sun was warm but the wind was chill
you know how it is with an april day
when the sun is out and the wind is still,
youre one month on in the middle of may
but if you so much as dare to speak,
a cloud comes over the sunlit arch,
a wind comes off a frozen peak,
and youre two months back in the middle of march
a bluebird comes tenderly up to alight
and turns to the wind to unruffle a plume,
his song so pitched as not to excite
a single flower as yet to bloom
it is snowing a flake and he half knew
winter was only playing possum
except in color he isnt blue,
but he wouldnt advise a thing to blossom
the water for which we may have to look
in summertime with a witching wand,
in every wheelruts now a brook,
in every print of a hoof a pond
be glad of water, but dont forget
the lurking frost in the earth beneath
that will steal forth after the sun is set
and show on the water its crystal teeth
the time when most i loved my task
the two must make me love it more
by coming with what they came to ask
youd think i never had felt before
the weight of an ax-head poised aloft,
the grip of earth on outspread feet,
the life of muscles rocking soft
and smooth and moist in vernal heat
out of the wood two hulking tramps
from sleeping god knows where last night,
but not long since in the lumber camps
they thought all chopping was theirs of right
men of the woods and lumberjacks,
they judged me by their appropriate tool
except as a fellow handled an ax
they had no way of knowing a fool
nothing on either side was said
they knew they had but to stay their stay
and all their logic would fill my head
as that i had no right to play
with what was another mans work for gain
my right might be love but theirs was need
and where the two exist in twain
theirs was the better right--agreed
but yield who will to their separation,
my object in living is to unite
my avocation and my vocation
as my two eyes make one in sight
only where love and need are one,
and the work is play for mortal stakes,
is the deed ever really done
for heaven and the futures sakes
