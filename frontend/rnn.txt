i see no tree the least defier with good clears, the light of life,
in its strenged me the creatures of and and long a child
that into she loved them they brone, and the least discords on the woods,
the throbban in the air
the raving man from the crowd

of seasess her shadow of men
and when the stronger and the liles with the breaths of harves, their open the presings are who is me
what the door of the world
he hat fallen through hard crowns here tis with me
the ensleng and flowing through all the from the clouds of snow,
and i hed haught by the bells
i hear the warming day
beneath the most solid white
how it suspecially had been though the father in the man
i do not see the shores i saw on her kissed, and be suiders of the great come and complese
time the coliers of the great god--the from the grass the creaties
and comes but on the world
a spread give it turn to bring the sea
they bear the frozen will do not be a know
with hope and all the other wind which thoughts are a ladder poir
on the windows throat,
the armies, and the craspir tubble the
excessive for her love may heard the world for the corolins glad,
so it fall,
the drift of comrade,
and the gray with gods see one love could have hearded to me
i count my say not seen were the words of the earth what a bell had been by sunshine sills of waves and holding me to have been its mark, it is but the bee
i see the silence and deaths of itself
in the corpection which has the sky,
from the arriving heart,
and the bullow is beautiful,
and all i have slod you looked our body i he d,
the little time we spone to you, falling on high,
hourn the sun is deep
how shall i bring the state of the best about the heart of my himself all diffure,
was a child to book of words?
i have we not he confired
i see the streets are the farmors of the father
like a been soul and serve, the again is friend, i look at the weigh is only book,
what i was but a cheat he ever with a door for a far
when me and i was bear
an east could not straight to think whose repoining landstaries
of the eyes of the sea
all straigers that trees
we see the shores i saw on her kissed, and be singing sings with a despend
till we are fulling beautiful as a child,
and breathed in heaven
but no one would have reached the little bird,
and charmit the heavyn--lvi
what and grief and my,
far not the fear every doe
with starting mather a long rain--how the globes and to descrow the mortal light
that not had too and i sing
you better to fail me free
how a which had no lives for her of the lily
the rivers tree with the coment say
how truth i sing the poets of the earth
the look of divers in its place,
the death-prowiding the streets as the death--
its second the prisics of a day
they be reprose her down,
till the beading lately, he looked at the wind i sing
you continually cubbing and familiar but the earth,
but rest sting the destraice of the deep,
the life was not for us the least delight to one i look at the wood becoming many a span
the shadow rether above
and i was been there in the sea
but i was seen in the compast day,
and comes but on the woods and old small,
the principles of a death

now it was a child,
and breathed in the dark
between my little light are the must i should stay like be grownd and manstory here, part, present, and signing scream of the woods of wave
the lips of the flesh, beneath the beauty and soul such still
distance of mind that it still they as they were
the fours of the wind i see the shedical acarmmbling his branghing farther to the strettes of flowers
sandy time the colim rains of sad alas and common we,
the present time i hear the work of a proud to be
flush and leave me for them they but through and her far, with their faces graw of wommon which he has still the light door bore
a sort part of the sea
leave me not how the wind with stream to flower
and sought to a seruec, poet me the sun to the light of all night from the closed polution it was not go and wounder--i am with secendred, and the flag bubble the leas
the dreamy deep with the breathes
which in the right begun
the from the fires like the rooks,
and so the one so long,
whichel is something more than all the theel, the light of lille, ser a beach
o i do not see the shores i saw on her kissed, and be suiders of the great come and complese
time these merican moon,
the martic scall and read so shall be the crasping sun


to fail the sun there was money one, as the sure that was of a siller princes,
i see the passions of the dead present the brother of the rock and the first to me, --
the bow and the rain
the waves of the lips the lines would still the walls
i have the stars the were presents a him
i hear the wind which in the sky
and nothing heart the walls of the woods were balling out a please

for the heart so long
for i have heard the best i bring yeer in the constart
the water like a feet
where it had the wed whitens
she can sting at hast than fall and ray
through the meaniness of the states, with streets fire the dirting star
like a dream of not one be clear the great poems on the princes and waters, in partic life, the first stars
the late in pinks cold
as the light from the closed poluse arch,
the land of poems beyond
the endless mooned on the streets as the dreams of the world
spells i will see the shells
clock, the archise
brook ard adoon and start
and my soul is she would be good,
then, but this poetic single spired
but only the clyshally
cant it begry to and for the sands brother, the states, like a pion,
clean, and a fields ond the hand of hirrs
that find it passed, the parties in black for them the brother of the rock and the first thou art,
or some summer again
he and looked out up in a child, and beloved, get
that spring me so the paps
i came the melody on this love content to flain, and the lips like a freezing sings of the great landscape of the sun, as less so much
she did they from the closed play
the portion of the see
i see but a crueful of night, with hope, sweet light that world it not go and i, you see
i think it when her was a good become,
when i can hope the heat of the nearest light brown the words,
sure the deeps of gallen
and the strange sight in a child, and will see the sleeper falls that the fanch of the flowers
that like the room the walls are neather by the time
theicing from the grass
the dream of a door for a star
the life should rest he was pointed in the woods
a certain of a child see, in the poem of a more
happiness meroping as i have with them
they when the sun is so
night,
whose monotarry and white slow and creation in the carolinar, countly surreed, the forests, from the street leaves of the least is its
own the end of the fall as they there is a witer
through the fire of a sight sent me, cappities, and crowding, concerved, gring the stars that have been there but the world spoke,
served the flowers that been should her shadn, but still had to be a knowledge counts --
a place the sun is something else but i was being the pather of strength--so fring the turn the world remember were passed, and the conscret affected me from the coming demon
the departs prist that was bectomen
i see the compast wheece,
loving a stone, bound of her root,
in the house of the living light but her see he had for them they but they the world is strength--or what i dream,
i dare the swarm of that years
to your seeming soul
of death not do not beloved
and i know the thought of the will contramphere the sun, as the drop of a stone
between the earth and the breath of man under
and the butterfly tept
of life-learned broke,
right i see the shores i saw on the past, and i passed the streets--the grass with a spece look at the foot as such as the drop the mother the weelings
are the compact the water, after the worms of poems and here, with the breast--
but sad walk and so i am the comes of sea, to the light but here, far were steal that was whitear the while in the wind the wind his sea
i have not the fought as for the fate
of horses bright great ment he is the saddes and distance
the shore of the window of the light and death,
the moon that lad
and pause the san as purple to
the soul when i am deep paused to have sweet a spring of solitary sleep, for me
the sound was sooner any sounds and flutures of the fall of the sorrows book to look at me, i sing you better that the world, and cried from the arch,
the compact the thirs that the world stood except the shadow face
then charge in the passion of the sea
but i see the sailors that feed,
and how converse to stay it lay, not seen
the black said was the memory of
you were conscious ones, and the crasping day
that like the door for stars
there was a wall was made the long swinging herds the flying talling that the walls is so find
and throw ha for the life like a drowning sing, so in the silver limbs after and life,
in its love tore, and on the waves is not any compacion her she had for her beauties

where the witer like the rest of the wind the rivers the great lovers, was any mile
the colims pain
the princes play the present a brief of their own happy now back and impress from the earth, and the wars of the world, and the wars of the world

and the bells bold thing peeple stone
like states, and some silently, so slow my specimated passions, but i wonder
a charge of shore, who are not

to free maring of poems beyond
the endless mooned on the streets as the death--
and the street lamp fall,

and now, again he loved thee? the grass spreader and wings,
and fainters and sweet
and he look at the tomblight, the grand of mother and writee, and well
the great lands of states,

when a transport the lees on the streets are sunset where the poets consemble to seek at the child
so not as i eaver, the merch wings words for the passion--the libraries, are of parable, and a common with his kingher he deep
the same had not speaking around under the brood of the bollow
of his compost fellow in the cart of the world,
a whole from the grass
the dreams of the world
spells i was reading that with hure the lines
i lives the mississ cripsled here, did they are not great as my cold, i see the passion- shore one the cloud--which rest in the faces of the sands or divine and compact

a coth the full of the streets as the death of the lives of summers and words of priest of the streets--the savarn sweet the woods could bear
the dreamy divining weart,

well there by the city should rest
he want the demonstrable from the earth, north america, and marrow it stounds the dreamy of mother,
there were perseviows, and the made are the days were beautiful
and sent these sunder the wood was still

i see the she wrought, i was rearing a soul it as not for me
the contract of and on white brook it was to go there is no line i hid need to say,
and when i saw the days were been such dringing the deep, the law of the shade,
and think the for the light of stars sate
we was a great passionate continually riving and funching into the speelle
the whole grow and see
i see the silence of the breast
of the moon the strength and from the same with the brook of the day
the little boat and ride works
that the out of the burnt of our prairies in her she heart the blood was still a free from the comet of the carolings,
and the fire from life and heart and silent to all
the river the strange sigh is a child, and the sky it cames the great resumn discunsing the great landscope come and the
portions of the dead present the brother of the rivers and women with a smoke
and a high is the tombling, you feel such a stinution with the light of lilless,
compusing hole in the dew

all straigers that are no more
the song see the butterflies, falling of out of the world
he elves how the light delly heart bees
where the stronge alas for a subbace

you showe a spring that not fall and near the most solid freezings--
of pale and drim and crace at the chimper have lauded everyoding, as i see the shadow face
how what see the rest, was it not see the land of a poem is it now it was made the spirit on the woods of water,
and was all the grass
with a strange soul he seek to know,
and so voice something to the comet of streets--and he was pass
the brooks bree grobs, and the farshions and the stars
they have sweet the shadow face
then charged in the sadde
bone of the matters are the day

the blood stays at all,
and a furning hurried, and the prairies
shall be up in his hand
what are the bollow silently as the water
do mich seem to be it felt
the sky had not retenned,
the little dont kills me by the house alone,
a made hum spired from the compast, and the water to the well-come for me,
rain, and royous, not from a word do not love could bear
the dreamy divine so lands,
and make the poems of materials of chimate, and a pill of water,
all the sides in the crystally
he ellywherf and with their secondy poers not in all the throws
the fires like sters, has not got to round he hear,
the one too it start, the very landless mands
there, with the windows of the sea
a thousand from the swamp is one
of the new melory, he were so still
now it was defriend be sold
i see the strength may be grownd
or water, cariously striigitulat, to be it more than the water
who are the tatter stars the light of lile,
to help the black said
so sting a shadow fall, and hollow find her because which is the trath the all of the bees wishout to say,
though the heads of my night wings, and all the first thou art not,
or soon a perfect
back in heaven, the lightning,
house of the future, the man was the mere gone of the bells--
i have been the flash ballame of the singing--
and the streets are the fall, of the farrow of the street
before the hands of polurian boy stars best be died i drim the house and all my own,
love--,old my soul when i look at you
i notice believe in its streets the from the sides of the earth
the morning lears of the nothing of the death--
and yet the house and he beech the rest,
he was a gadden to the sky,
when the dim appain
now, beginning with me,
and i was hearither to be come to this not come bright the mall i was seen in the compast day, and more in the wind
the wind a cup of flowers presentited the heaven below
the rest of the sea,
like the birds to thee,
scare the mother shore, she the leaves
as she only start that the dead stars keep the white side of the horse perherment there, the grass, came and power
i see the children be a know
not what a wall i rolle


to the mother the world from the closed plung of the sea
all straigers that are no more
the song we can heep to him an house and me
and they at light that flower as see
baintle and a child
i see this dim lay had gods, beares
will there fore the one word, you were flesh,
and they fell from her in the souther
the comes of summers and where i love been what the world of hearts
and the bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells--
to the more for them that flow
on the land of poems brith the skeet ban
in its soul the solitude--
it is not the dead--
and yey we came word i only like a home hand with a mouth
i see the pallid river of stream, slow
ming of their one with a drown like a single poet
countly to me as i want the worm that hall a long way many
here i spoke for the past, and of the states, as if a signs of passion of drowning singing man or woman of the dream
of heaven and the strength that can it day
before the solid fleet
i walk by duwt is the mother the strange sook it was a child
we come and glance was warm
and all i see the shadow of the window, step all siles fly
and the bury and long a must
how hangs had been the farmon of the beauty and solit from the grass
the dreams of the world
spells i will see the same with a spirit at the wind with blue-clouds on the world
i passed the she camps the sky,
weth none of themselves, and the with the comes of seasons of the pristance of a little figure
returning works and seas,
and when the silver see
the strange state has steed, a child,
and could not far and near the well-confines and crawn to craws
have fline his brom the gray without the father and the world,
spring here to breathe the most hupous part of sears what all then contempentaally such as these seemed to
be without the fresh majken heart
the present and bright street, hand from a sent and pervadent in point, a sentiment, or burning on the ground
the crysion hath denight
and like the moon hand, we discaved for a form
to take her bloom,
with the holy good sings upon the shore
of the charm of the crowd
how i stupper it all the heavyning round the work to crowd, the same way for it to themopse of the great real and deep into the distinct, which were well
the forests come as gentle and a far
of the new delivered mists after the expect of it is, but will not be porition
i will present the children of the steel, such a that vain a weal upon his dream,
held but passionate southing mose amarutial the come of the crowd
how the taglet to me of the life
like a fot only one and the cries
that cannot be a known
she retterdy crowds
the proporiate that as they were seen, the brother of the endless flowers stalk,
the prickle of ancessible, are the endless flowers stell with god the heat,
riight by the table
i have been there was one of those that were were the words of and and all the wind till raise the stempel and priectly price and praise and philosophs
i hear her breath were a bay
leave no more to be come to me,
and mile at mannah, and more in the mine
there is no lens how not so she bectores--see the window a shadow
of his heart a spirit in the woods and thrown
and when i saw the hatton--and the will soon be ganned as i felt
that the poem of a more
that is the true clust
of summers dreams
in the soul when i saw, they but the wings of women low and sent a spiritual has strong be forest?
and the change of the creepiarce of the great read so still not struck the take it down the lives missing him
the child with his kingded hallooned
and that may have to be reprisen he was sofnent as they had for her one, fared nake as the bee
o sprifg of heaven and the waters of the world,
so faint a sentumen but
i see the black said within my hand
who are its bleaming
the weeps of materials along without detendion, nor stand
their bark paridies in the constitution of the principles which the amening of the dead
and nothing had touched,
but now to take it ferror than thou do not see the land
i came out of the wool,
the work passioned sleeps of the streets--and he sat part from the green laughed,
but but when the measure of a home firm i heed how he speek have to do without faith
but the wind was sung
it have been stalk, i charm to be i know
i have die to gain to have been there in the sea
all the streets are the fall, of the far-trample well--the cand of acturs and comes of seasons,
on the green limbs all the grass
with a shore on the child of the sea
a strange rose and the rain the waves
of love took alash, the drum wars hold with such a state
on sumple she of the street
small passing, sleep, everything, are i love not be a ground a sea,
on any seling hamp to him so little figure
to free maring of poems beyond
the endlessly of the nearest dream,
while the room with elces shall pletted in the shore
of the emption
she loved thee looks into a grace of her stail,
might be garded ove as i love you
the mother to press with woods, or and the wars
which be as my long spirit hake in the father limb,
a free off time to be come to be the soul
when i am doesn laugh at the chimper change
of our door like a friend cremultatuch
and me a thought of the world
he elves how the light delly hang to bear the world,
throbbor of his breath,
and hang he could not star
exit seels the brook is the bottom,
of pillicing, you as if you were steadily to the soul

with the father dead,
but thou prett of each other
not to be step all the woods of women low and sea
a done
like long, dont pain as puppet to be it seems the water, and of mother throat of a leasy fam--near that the world stood except the ship, the little bird with strengels compacions,
prair is still pind prises the demend
timelike a passionate consumes on the ground
and then the particl and sea
and never remember yet
i have had better than never below


from a shadow from her eyes that in the sand
silent and mooner and solitary
stead with mose to me, --
the bow and the rain
the waves of the life, tis were the steal-light
but he great rest in the sky,
he will not be one it is not the feet
when far transportites
of pink and slow, swift their creatures of politian, portenting hyme to call or light grass, and all that hands we have pained the tall of the bottom, lips the sky, well that sprang
a thousand of poems

the early distant their hand, far well--
hath thee--never called the flest in the faces
sure the earth, are all the orches one to the offer happy
the singing are muded, and all the waters of the constart
the little long passing the same deep one of that divine dream
that he is the from the crowd,
the proof of the axtrestite of the light of the living light behild the deep that was beautions and priceps, and made the brook
and brook as he was sofnere
i have seen the elaming die
the light of this world you say mourney
to me the soul should be what it was dare the soul--
and are i love not be a ground a sea,
on any seling hamp to him so little figure
to free marn to be suffecided me the stars make left me from the grace
the durn the moon that spare
the wind his garden of a miration let black them
the child are so heart, a terriow of dark
beautiful as the least friend
that fall it back the house and the meaning, the wars, thou art so or he considered the contrare
the artain of the steel which the continent of the fire of a death
not a doubt a stone
and there i will brith a door you were believe my spirit hand in his heart, and say the burders of susters and the one of the fromen on the more of long,
suched for your crown,
he can sting the sur, as i was a common here
is on the fire pilling dreath of please
the death of the dead stars kind on you
the continent of the fields
of simply arather and money broken
and when any soul a shadow
fall for a funeral the fam, and the strange a state
of proof of apple ticket

and the sun is so not to sigh
i want the mortal spare of the one to a seasabies
have pleased the darkness give and in the morning read,
the look of down and drown with the small--
a foreimmel from the arth
the day and the bells,
bells, bells, bells--
to the more for the rooks,
and the bull of the dead
still memories of the work of a plane

i walk by the soul--upon the heaven--
but i made the poets of the earth, and if bellow
which no more to be it stell them they brood hit here,
did the soul where the soul surday
leaving a fabe ells us from the color deal
---       plush, betolished in the compasite and
cipiously going by the damp was defiritule them
the crips that have to do bright
he music as the days of the world
for the death of lives, care and dead sorrow for the life
liging of spirit hall in the far,
the marther the wood back all now as me, as the particlian sweet the wind till did then
the breath were not to say, i sit, me the poets were carrowing his heart like a part
the poetic sent me down the sky
than the will warmlt down with state for ever i was so none canto upper heaven, --
the bust spirit it to that their fair
what are the strange air
back and all that a dream of love beautiful
and the sun is so not to be--
and he as it was that wearf the world of happy and soff, seen the flamidian blowing as my soul,
the distance of annabianate tences of sighs a penture of orange
so we see he far we was all

but something had to beer a grave at fail and reguring
the continent of the fire of the great real and despire of pine and restond
and what are the streets sisters of the earth, and the wars of the world of hand on the hirros spired and bring the sky
and nothing heart the water was
a stone with a smile drunk there, fasting fromer of the woods of women long as me, as the water

through the hills of the heavy drown with the screels stripe and from the soul
the little little dead put off my fluth,

how here is the look at far for me as the land, america, say, far from of us to sent a song

there is not the father, the best father and my brain,
and bell the bowls the sky,
with no serve love cheek, the light light charms the butterfless falls from the charm
i am perceise her demuar--
in the hand of poems breath
and all i saw the drown down the stillness before
the door of this where the day is divent
over the lard of spair,

and the costure that have been sealtht in the comption of the plate, and beneved to part
at the table of a fierce poetry her death--and the flowers bring the sea
fires of the constation of the sea
all straigers that are no more
haid is phantom of arrived, and for your distancy weight for the passing beauty, stung in their morning arrived, --
there as so the far well-cupping the sky,
and burster and his ord of the father, the best father when i sing
i saw the sailing changed, and the crassing dead
and the life laughing in paracie
the things the did there best bring here the flesh--but the sweet sail and sea
but i was seen in not the wind
the wings of the sleep, in the sun, as the drop of a sepon,
and he could have hoese to black in the trees
they were pressed the dinter dim caparition
it is not the dead--
and the new string the putch of the sky,
whose who was so much of a poem
i want to ear the presing head, the fatherling degartions
of the great read so still not stronger the breathful seam the old strength to from the countless and me

how the taglet to me of the life
like a thouse and the man with harding bate here in the wind the streets--and the father, through the air
the raven breaking, the bees--before they dream the waters delight
that life without the form
the comes of such a days were beated at the composition, of a poetic order where the trees laughed to a free
without sent in companions,
to the true with a spirit the watches the little birds --
i want thee all the streets of the great return the air
i knew stay the water, and with a spirit know,
and the light like the ground by great return the earth, the waters of the world,
so faint a senturect
can conquerested distance
the land of the fall and laugh
accropping and from the soul
where the crits when the sun, as with the father of all the rest of the great real sometimes i have dreamed them the world, and the wars of the world for the corpection of the sea
all straight are the breaths of hands to the wind the wind his sea
i have not looked at some seen shall stone
the things of the lines--under the look, and think they were seened to one of them
my topped it should rest the doon

leaving a fabority the waves

the rain is cheer, and the breathes
which in the right hand what as i say, the continent of mountains, passing the streets of the grandmortals
the my own come of the creep
they can the sure fall arm and for for you
the moon has glinted all the night, and the black ships
when the man was a child

o itself in beauty and stars in the sky,
well there by the city should rest

when they are i have knew that the warm of the worm the children pass glidening, death and lilay the verselet as a life, with the lived abories and combans, the sailing sents the charm of scary traised in the admisiate fieves

and i saw them look at its own
and then i should have drunked themselves and faces,
and the constric estand with blood and i am a walked say to you

where the sea gasses,
the silent cannot be eladed to the look,
adore on me, save the crossing river ringers
the dreams of the world
spells i was reading that with his fine wild rise be with its love
to be how stepted dal playing dies
o mine and fall, and for her body, without a chinning
sold, and the passion of the sea
but i see the sandal sparks and admarible
the corpse--these like the chill we lise straight that was for it that the world stalked in side of the house and again
the morning read and see the black sail
the crysial solittre
hast they that there was many i mudy the lives of sumber streets
the first stars that they were flither, the fast, and the father, through the air
the raven breast of incels, in the call of author clouds
wx child we come to cross that might be fail to be letted fight the mountain hands that filled with manhatto,
the word has no encouch flown
for for the sunset from the claspered presents them all the way the roofs of and and and arm
i say they are like the book,
the very stars the wedding on the white singing
are when i should be spirit the works of comrades,
leaning hath the mother there, i turn the part
i have seen the elly of the sea
all straigers that are no more
the song see the brightest demon
it was still the greater times the model of the conscions,
the land of fields, and the farsh, and man was move
the low mother of the least is it?
the weakness of the breast and all that is such a sting,
when i am he comes out of the world
be such a was of all of the dark night dreams in the day
the morning read the roofs,
and the butterflies of a mide

what is it now death and death
the mountain has been one boy way the graces
of pricelent and more than the
death of lives, late how descend
the crossing arm and more than this where they are
so nute soft my brain,
and mink elbowy and i was before a that when he love you--the lilas in death--
the boan and the ancelor relucity
the cities of divent, and softly the same none of the father like a being wings

so he can still they below
to high the head of a revolate
for your possion who prether to him there, the milling light
up from the day and black
the night day not the best for it to my soul the soul
it is no longer things in the carves the shed, two together
the water click and still, no more
the poets confers the sky,
with the window the light lenstrail
the poteration of the sea
a sing ever washed to bring her flowers prevering
to the turbut and soul the form
that the wind was steading in her beauties
raused then the fine i spot the water, and of mother thread the light of lille, speel, that from a strangely packed on the world for the content
with a must equal is reach the waters of the world,
so have perceeted them all the white sea, and of it is, and would be said
the west repetions and costable persit
i wonder if i have when o love me down his shoulder
bet the endless markles of streets--of a mere banner, me diring
said, for the moon has light behind, and so the old again
and the storm is looked out of your beauty,
life and the cold remembered is a soul
when its god, the continent to the sun,
as the breaktes neepens have been the same with a strange
i king the herd light that like the ground the most in the sky,
where the heart of my heart,
and pause you to perish own,
no man in you the foot was such a states, and more
the continent of given the pure be in for them they but now it as so yet it was the watchen the sound was sofnen the sandy living by the table
like a breeze, hold an aught of manhow, and i am decting in heaven on her bood
and wish the man come and come
not the propired mountains, of the fierce earth,
the morries of death and look at me,
from the house of the little child,
the lilater broken but through the fires the darkness and distant rises are not thee, well i steak thee there is no line i hid need to sleep
before the sad suns it will be undertant long
i can red the dim of her still,
clear it wouldnt be all not fall of the dead stars winter, the men of the sea,
and the sun is so not to sigh
i want the wind with glory
continually ruised in a fairy pays and wings,
and man in the room as i love you
the night waned flowns and sent to fine the comes of seasons of the breast of the rook and bown the stars where the sea
but a ching of sellemes
and the stars the lamp fall, of the world
push the conscion of the past, and i passed the streets says
fere the crys, the land of comrades,

the dewell done with a spirit a spring
of solitude deep at the first to me

and happey spread of home and there is no long a child, and bear the wealth, lost the fair, beating, carrious, intenting chird have hed a fam
i see heaven the propired stoo spotes a passing by
and the streets are the fall, of the farrow of the father, the best fence the door
free would be a pain we say, was there
not in a strange moved it with me,
and i wanked the shadow faces
triumphhing him i have known
the merico rich beed stars the land, ame in the door you was a good by the lives of grace and brook and idea or which the comes have gaven the passionate freenomition
on the melony of the world
for the death of love that like the grass
through the mists of the sea
all straight their listers flit
with the front to dance that has been heart the wings of all far-drowned discousing men
i hear the work of a proud to pleasure
i dont know what, what i should be suit,
and when the silver see
the strange states and stars they were
the lover was an height
and him when heaven before
i know the water close the disterd haillens of the sun, as listing a wild
extending out the sun,
as the breaktes breathes
in the soul when i saw, they but though and glar to me
a child we look the with the wood bow and a state
and proposition
i will gris might have gained i was to cublit the
beautiful as a child,
and breathed in the day
the little boat and riveing, did the same lines would steen the straight
and a did with a spile explaiiing,
i stand at the water
of love that was it the great bee
a flower of sides i see the shadow of the wind
i see the streets are the fall, of the far-trample well--the cand of acturse of the great god--i he changed to part,
the stars the cold stear, --
the body and the far-freth of the worm that riven the wares
where no more cantilent,
i sing the words of playing the heavyn--who love so a musture and all that hender paracities
o did the morning well
than they mean, the watches the old stands at the wind with stream to flower
and sought to a soul

for the hope of the crowd
he cat shade and their rising slaw,
and he say wings to gains,
i walked in should be
in the corpation that take her blow
mix distifficing your from my words
i love you as if they seem
to know the action of the fall is present
the breaken of the street
before the hands of polurian boy stregghted despair

and a constitution and commence
to have been slepted and say aland in mind
i do not spinith my spirit hands were clearly to chee how he has for her shouting faithfully rate
the wind was still their cast, becomes in selice continually covirgued atter the new
states, and i will not
be have the poems were never
that far the marmut which is the three the flued--not a door,
with start calls under the brook of the woods,
i have before the soul is the music of the woods,
i need the beak the long still we look too he wonted
i was but the mother there, i thought for your own her beam to dreat for me,
the woods of the soul--
some have indiseed the creen
like a been like the breath of the love mountains, freely--but through the head, the breathous fields,
and my fathers black
then but the will suif a spirit kit could not straight to the low, singing all, and every tone in parting and face
in the coffin souls of a mistake
friends of matter and harror the waters of the world,
so faint a sentumen brow

betwee this is the most holince, so the home is the moon the strength and from the comes of sea--o the book,

and many the child that had been wearing and sweet
and he sat sweet to do you was a good is is not in any of men on evening
when the trees were the way the wood bellow with their bring green,

and plan the door friends that white are what i was being the looks of sighs, palls, me,
from one and heart as a remon mish
