let us go then, you and i,
when the evening is spread out against the sky
like a patient etherized upon a table
let us go, through certain halfdeserted streets,
the muttering retreats
of restless nights in onenight cheap hotels
and sawdust restaurants with oystershells
streets that follow like a tedious argument
of insidious intent
to lead you to an overwhelming question
oh, do not ask, what is it?
let us go and make our visit
in the room the women come and go
talking of michelangelo
the yellow fog that rubs its back upon the windowpanes,
the yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the windowpanes,
licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,
lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,
let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,
slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,
and seeing that it was a soft october night,
curled once about the house, and fell asleep
and indeed there will be time
for the yellow smoke that slides along the street,
rubbing its back upon the windowpanes
there will be time, there will be time
to prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet
there will be time to murder and create,
and time for all the works and days of hands
that lift and drop a question on your plate
time for you and time for me,
and time yet for a hundred indecisions,
and for a hundred visions and revisions,
before the taking of a toast and tea
in the room the women come and go
talking of michelangelo
and indeed there will be time
to wonder, do i dare? and, do i dare?
time to turn back and descend the stair,
with a bald spot in the middle of my hair
they will say how his hair is growing thin
my morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,
my necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin
they will say but how his arms and legs are thin
do i dare
disturb the universe?
in a minute there is time
for decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse
for i have known them all already, known them all
have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,
i have measured out my life with coffee spoons
i know the voices dying with a dying fall
beneath the music from a farther room
so how should i presume?
and i have known the eyes already, known them all
the eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,
and when i am formulated, sprawling on a pin,
when i am pinned and wriggling on the wall,
then how should i begin
to spit out all the buttends of my days and ways?
and how should i presume?
and i have known the arms already, known them all
arms that are braceleted and white and bare
but in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair
is it perfume from a dress
that makes me so digress?
arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl
and should i then presume?
and how should i begin?
shall i say, i have gone at dusk through narrow streets
and watched the smoke that rises from the pipes
of lonely men in shirtsleeves, leaning out of windows?
i should have been a pair of ragged claws
scuttling across the floors of silent seas

and the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully
smoothed by long fingers,
asleep  tired  or it malingers,
stretched on the floor, here beside you and me
should i, after tea and cakes and ices,
have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?
but though i have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,
though i have seen my head grown slightly bald brought in upon a platter,
i am no prophetand heres no great matter
i have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,
and i have seen the eternal footman hold my coat, and snicker,
and in short, i was afraid
and would it have been worth it, after all,
after the cups, the marmalade, the tea,
among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,
would it have been worth while,
to have bitten off the matter with a smile,
to have squeezed the universe into a ball
to roll it towards some overwhelming question,
to say i am lazarus, come from the dead,
come back to tell you all, i shall tell you all
if one, settling a pillow by her head
should say that is not what i meant at all
that is not it, at all
and would it have been worth it, after all,
would it have been worth while,
after the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,
after the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor
and this, and so much more?
it is impossible to say just what i mean
but as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen
would it have been worth while
if one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,
and turning toward the window, should say
that is not it at all,
that is not what i meant, at all
no i am not prince hamlet, nor was meant to be
am an attendant lord, one that will do
to swell a progress, start a scene or two,
advise the prince no doubt, an easy tool,
deferential, glad to be of use,
politic, cautious, and meticulous
full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse
at times, indeed, almost ridiculous
almost, at times, the fool
i grow old  i grow old
i shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled
shall i part my hair behind? do i dare to eat a peach?
i shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach
i have heard the mermaids singing, each to each
i do not think that they will sing to me
i have seen them riding seaward on the waves
combing the white hair of the waves blown back
when the wind blows the water white and black
we have lingered in the chambers of the sea
by seagirls wreathed with seaweed red and brown
till human voices wake us, and we drown
they are rattling breakfast plates in basement kitchens,
and along the trampled edges of the street
i am aware of the damp souls of housemaids
sprouting despondently at area gates
the brown waves of fog toss up to me
twisted faces from the bottom of the street,
and tear from a passerby with muddy skirts
an aimless smile that hovers in the air
and vanishes along the level of the roofs
twelve oclock
along the reaches of the street
held in a lunar synthesis,
whispering lunar incantations
dissolve the floors of memory
and all its clear relations,
its divisions and precisions,
every street lamp that i pass
beats like a fatalistic drum,
and through the spaces of the dark
midnight shakes the memory
as a madman shakes a dead geranium
halfpast one,
the street lamp sputtered,
the street lamp muttered,
the street lamp said, regard that woman
who hesitates towards you in the light of the door
which opens on her like a grin
you see the border of her dress
is torn and stained with sand,
and you see the corner of her eye
twists like a crooked pin
the memory throws up high and dry
a crowd of twisted things
a twisted branch upon the beach
eaten smooth, and polished
as if the world gave up
the secret of its skeleton,
stiff and white
a broken spring in a factory yard,
rust that clings to the form that the strength has left
hard and curled and ready to snap
halfpast two,
the street lamp said,
remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter,
slips out its tongue
and devours a morsel of rancid butter
so the hand of a child, automatic,
slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along the quay
i could see nothing behind that childs eye
i have seen eyes in the street
trying to peer through lighted shutters,
and a crab one afternoon in a pool,
an old crab with barnacles on his back,
gripped the end of a stick which i held him
halfpast three,
the lamp sputtered,
the lamp muttered in the dark
the lamp hummed
regard the moon,
la lune ne garde aucune rancune,
she winks a feeble eye,
she smiles into corners
she smoothes the hair of the grass
the moon has lost her memory
a washedout smallpox cracks her face,
her hand twists a paper rose,
that smells of dust and old cologne,
she is alone
with all the old nocturnal smells
that cross and cross across her brain
the reminiscence comes
of sunless dry geraniums
and dust in crevices,
smells of chestnuts in the streets,
and female smells in shuttered rooms,
and cigarettes in corridors
and cocktail smells in bars
the lamp said,
four oclock,
here is the number on the door
memory
you have the key,
the little lamp spreads a ring on the stair,
mount
the bed is open the toothbrush hangs on the wall,
put your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for life
the last twist of the knife
apeneck sweeney spreads his knees
letting his arms hang down to laugh,
the zebra stripes along his jaw
swelling to maculate giraffe
the circles of the stormy moon
slide westward toward the river plate,
death and the raven drift above
and sweeney guards the horned gate
gloomy orion and the dog
are veiled and hushed the shrunken seas
the person in the spanish cape
tries to sit on sweeneys knees
slips and pulls the table cloth
overturns a coffeecup,
reorganized upon the floor
she yawns and draws a stocking up
the silent man in mocha brown
sprawls at the windowsill and gapes
the waiter brings in oranges
bananas figs and hothouse grapes
the silent vertebrate in brown
contracts and concentrates, withdraws
rachel ne rabinovitch
tears at the grapes with murderous paws
she and the lady in the cape
are suspect, thought to be in league
therefore the man with heavy eyes
declines the gambit, shows fatigue,
leaves the room and reappears
outside the window, leaning in,
branches of wistaria
circumscribe a golden grin
the host with someone indistinct
converses at the door apart,
the nightingales are singing near
the convent of the sacred heart,
and sang within the bloody wood
when agamemnon cried aloud,
and let their liquid droppings fall
to stain the stiff dishonoured shroud
as she laughed i was aware of becoming involved
in her laughter and being part of it, until her
teeth were only accidental stars with a talent
for squaddrill i was drawn in by short gasps,
inhaled at each momentary recovery, lost finally
in the dark caverns of her throat, bruised by
the ripple of unseen muscles an elderly waiter
with trembling hands was hurriedly spreading
a pink and white checked cloth over the rusty
green iron table, saying if the lady and
gentleman wish to take their tea in the garden,
if the lady and gentleman wish to take their
tea in the garden  i decided that if the
shaking of her breasts could be stopped, some of
the fragments of the afternoon might be collected,
and i concentrated my attention with careful
subtlety to this end
the broadbacked hippopotamus
rests on his belly in the mud
although he seems so firm to us
he is merely flesh and blood
fleshandblood is weak and frail,
susceptible to nervous shock
while the true church can never fail
for it is based upon a rock
the hippos feeble steps may err
in compassing material ends,
while the true church need never stir
to gather in its dividends
the potamus can never reach
the mango on the mangotree
but fruits of pomegranate and peach
refresh the church from over sea
at mating time the hippos voice
betrays inflexions hoarse and odd,
but every week we hear rejoice
the church, at being one with god
the hippopotamuss day
is passed in sleep at night he hunts
god works in a mysterious way
the church can sleep and feed at once
i saw the potamus take wing
ascending from the damp savannas,
and quiring angels round him sing
the praise of god, in loud hosannas
blood of the lamb shall wash him clean
and him shall heavenly arms enfold,
among the saints he shall be seen
performing on a harp of gold
he shall be washed as white as snow,
by all the martyrd virgins kist,
while the true church remains below
wrapt in the old miasmal mist
mistah kurtzhe dead
a penny for the old guy
i
we are the hollow men
we are the stuffed men
leaning together
headpiece filled with straw alas
our dried voices, when
we whisper together
are quiet and meaningless
as wind in dry grass
or rats feet over broken glass
in our dry cellar
shape without form, shade without colour,
paralysed force, gesture without motion
those who have crossed
with direct eyes, to deaths other kingdom
remember usif at allnot as lost
violent souls, but only
as the hollow men
the stuffed men
ii
eyes i dare not meet in dreams
in deaths dream kingdom
these do not appear
there, the eyes are
sunlight on a broken column
there, is a tree swinging
and voices are
in the winds singing
more distant and more solemn
than a fading star
let me be no nearer
in deaths dream kingdom
let me also wear
such deliberate disguises
rats coat, crowskin, crossed staves
in a field
behaving as the wind behaves
no nearer
not that final meeting
in the twilight kingdom
iii
this is the dead land
this is cactus land
here the stone images
are raised, here they receive
the supplication of a dead mans hand
under the twinkle of a fading star
is it like this
in deaths other kingdom
waking alone
at the hour when we are
trembling with tenderness
lips that would kiss
form prayers to broken stone
iv
the eyes are not here
there are no eyes here
in this valley of dying stars
in this hollow valley
this broken jaw of our lost kingdoms
in this last of meeting places
we grope together
and avoid speech
gathered on this beach of the tumid river
sightless, unless
the eyes reappear
as the perpetual star
multifoliate rose
of deaths twilight kingdom
the hope only
of empty men
v
here we go round the prickly pear
prickly pear prickly pear
here we go round the prickly pear
at five oclock in the morning
between the idea
and the reality
between the motion
and the act
falls the shadow
for thine is the kingdom
between the conception
and the creation
between the emotion
and the response
falls the shadow
life is very long
between the desire
and the spasm
between the potency
and the existence
between the essence
and the descent
falls the shadow
for thine is the kingdom
for thine is
life is
for thine is the
this is the way the world ends
this is the way the world ends
this is the way the world ends
not with a bang but a whimper
