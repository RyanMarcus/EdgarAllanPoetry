success is counted sweetest
by those who neer succeed
to comprehend a nectar
requires sorest need
not one of all the purple host
who took the flag to-day
can tell the definition,
so clear, of victory,
as he, defeated, dying,
on whose forbidden ear
the distant strains of triumph
break, agonized and clear
ii
our share of night to bear,
our share of morning,
our blank in bliss to fill,
our blank in scorning
here a star, and there a star,
some lose their way
here a mist, and there a mist,
afterwards -- day
iii
rouge et noir
soul, wilt thou toss again?
by just such a hazard
hundreds have lost, indeed,
but tens have won an all
angels breathless ballot
lingers to record thee
imps in eager caucus
raffle for my soul
iv
rouge gagne
t is so much joy t is so much joy
if i should fail, what poverty
and yet, as poor as i
have ventured all upon a throw
have gained yes hesitated so
this side the victory
life is but life, and death but death
bliss is but bliss, and breath but breath
and if, indeed, i fail,
at least to know the worst is sweet
defeat means nothing but defeat,
no drearier can prevail
and if i gain, -- oh, gun at sea,
oh, bells that in the steeples be,
at first repeat it slow
for heaven is a different thing
conjectured, and waked sudden in,
and might oerwhelm me so
v
glee the great storm is over
four have recovered the land
forty gone down together
into the boiling sand
ring, for the scant salvation
toll, for the bonnie souls, --
neighbor and friend and bridegroom,
spinning upon the shoals
how they will tell the shipwreck
when winter shakes the door,
till the children ask, but the forty?
did they come back no more?
then a silence suffuses the story,
and a softness the tellers eye
and the children no further question,
and only the waves reply
vi
if i can stop one heart from breaking,
i shall not live in vain
if i can ease one life the aching,
or cool one pain,
or help one fainting robin
unto his nest again,
i shall not live in vain
vii
almost
within my reach
i could have touched
i might have chanced that way
soft sauntered through the village,
sauntered as soft away
so unsuspected violets
within the fields lie low,
too late for striving fingers
that passed, an hour ago
viii
a wounded deer leaps highest,
ive heard the hunter tell
t is but the ecstasy of death,
and then the brake is still
the smitten rock that gushes,
the trampled steel that springs
a cheek is always redder
just where the hectic stings
mirth is the mail of anguish,
in which it cautions arm,
lest anybody spy the blood
and youre hurt exclaim
ix
the heart asks pleasure first,
and then, excuse from pain
and then, those little anodynes
that deaden suffering
and then, to go to sleep
and then, if it should be
the will of its inquisitor,
the liberty to die
x
in a library
a precious, mouldering pleasure t is
to meet an antique book,
in just the dress his century wore
a privilege, i think,
his venerable hand to take,
and warming in our own,
a passage back, or two, to make
to times when he was young
his quaint opinions to inspect,
his knowledge to unfold
on what concerns our mutual mind,
the literature of old
what interested scholars most,
what competitions ran
when plato was a certainty
and sophocles a man
when sappho was a living girl,
and beatrice wore
the gown that dante deified
facts, centuries before,
he traverses familiar,
as one should come to town
and tell you all your dreams were true
he lived where dreams were sown
his presence is enchantment,
you beg him not to go
old volumes shake their vellum heads
and tantalize, just so
xi
much madness is divinest sense
to a discerning eye
much sense the starkest madness
t is the majority
in this, as all, prevails
assent, and you are sane
demur, -- youre straightway dangerous,
and handled with a chain
xii
i asked no other thing,
no other was denied
i offered being for it
the mighty merchant smiled
brazil? he twirled a button,
without a glance my way
but, madam, is there nothing else
that we can show to-day?
xiii
exclusion
the soul selects her own society,
then shuts the door
on her divine majority
obtrude no more
unmoved, she notes the chariots pausing
at her low gate
unmoved, an emperor is kneeling
upon her mat
ive known her from an ample nation
choose one
then close the valves of her attention
like stone
xiv
the secret
some things that fly there be, --
birds, hours, the bumble-bee
of these no elegy
some things that stay there be, --
grief, hills, eternity
nor this behooveth me
there are, that resting, rise
can i expound the skies?
how still the riddle lies
xv
the lonely house
i know some lonely houses off the road
a robber d like the look of, --
wooden barred,
and windows hanging low,
inviting to
a portico,
where two could creep
one hand the tools,
the other peep
to make sure alls asleep
old-fashioned eyes,
not easy to surprise
how orderly the kitchen d look by night,
with just a clock, --
but they could gag the tick,
and mice wont bark
and so the walls dont tell,
none will
a pair of spectacles ajar just stir --
an almanacs aware
was it the mat winked,
or a nervous star?
the moon slides down the stair
to see whos there
theres plunder, -- where?
tankard, or spoon,
earring, or stone,
a watch, some ancient brooch
to match the grandmamma,
staid sleeping there
day rattles, too,
stealths slow
the sun has got as far
as the third sycamore
screams chanticleer,
whos there?
and echoes, trains away,
sneer -- where?
while the old couple, just astir,
fancy the sunrise left the door ajar
xvi
to fight aloud is very brave,
but gallanter, i know,
who charge within the bosom,
the cavalry of woe
who win, and nations do not see,
who fall, and none observe,
whose dying eyes no country
regards with patriot love
we trust, in plumed procession,
for such the angels go,
rank after rank, with even feet
and uniforms of snow
xvii
dawn
when night is almost done,
and sunrise grows so near
that we can touch the spaces,
it s time to smooth the hair
and get the dimples ready,
and wonder we could care
for that old faded midnight
that frightened but an hour
xviii
the book of martyrs
read, sweet, how others strove,
till we are stouter
what they renounced,
till we are less afraid
how many times they bore
the faithful witness,
till we are helped,
as if a kingdom cared
read then of faith
that shone above the fagot
clear strains of hymn
the river could not drown
brave names of men
and celestial women,
passed out of record
into renown
xix
the mystery of pain
pain has an element of blank
it cannot recollect
when it began, or if there were
a day when it was not
it has no future but itself,
its infinite realms contain
its past, enlightened to perceive
new periods of pain
xx
i taste a liquor never brewed,
from tankards scooped in pearl
not all the vats upon the rhine
yield such an alcohol
inebriate of air am i,
and debauchee of dew,
reeling, through endless summer days,
from inns of molten blue
when landlords turn the drunken bee
out of the foxgloves door,
when butterflies renounce their drams,
i shall but drink the more
till seraphs swing their snowy hats,
and saints to windows run,
to see the little tippler
leaning against the sun
xxi
a book
he ate and drank the precious words,
his spirit grew robust
he knew no more that he was poor,
nor that his frame was dust
he danced along the dingy days,
and this bequest of wings
was but a book what liberty
a loosened spirit brings
xxii
i had no time to hate, because
the grave would hinder me,
and life was not so ample i
could finish enmity
nor had i time to love but since
some industry must be,
the little toil of love, i thought,
was large enough for me
xxiii
unreturning
t was such a little, little boat
that toddled down the bay
t was such a gallant, gallant sea
that beckoned it away
t was such a greedy, greedy wave
that licked it from the coast
nor ever guessed the stately sails
my little craft was lost
xxiv
whether my bark went down at sea,
whether she met with gales,
whether to isles enchanted
she bent her docile sails
by what mystic mooring
she is held to-day, --
this is the errand of the eye
out upon the bay
xxv
belshazzar had a letter, --
he never had but one
belshazzars correspondent
concluded and begun
in that immortal copy
the conscience of us all
can read without its glasses
on revelations wall
xxvi
the brain within its groove
runs evenly and true
but let a splinter swerve,
t were easier for you
to put the water back
when floods have slit the hills,
and scooped a turnpike for themselves,
and blotted out the mills
ii love
i
mine
mine by the right of the white election
mine by the royal seal
mine by the sign in the scarlet prison
bars cannot conceal
mine, here in vision and in veto
mine, by the graves repeal
titled, confirmed, -- delirious charter
mine, while the ages steal
ii
bequest
you left me, sweet, two legacies, --
a legacy of love
a heavenly father would content,
had he the offer of
you left me boundaries of pain
capacious as the sea,
between eternity and time,
your consciousness and me
iii
alter? when the hills do
falter? when the sun
question if his glory
be the perfect one
surfeit? when the daffodil
doth of the dew
even as herself, o friend
i will of you
iv
suspense
elysium is as far as to
the very nearest room,
if in that room a friend await
felicity or doom
what fortitude the soul contains,
that it can so endure
the accent of a coming foot,
the opening of a door
v
surrender
doubt me, my dim companion
why, god would be content
with but a fraction of the love
poured thee without a stint
the whole of me, forever,
what more the woman can, --
say quick, that i may dower thee
with last delight i own
it cannot be my spirit,
for that was thine before
i ceded all of dust i knew, --
what opulence the more
had i, a humble maiden,
whose farthest of degree
was that she might,
some distant heaven,
dwell timidly with thee
vi
if you were coming in the fall,
id brush the summer by
with half a smile and half a spurn,
as housewives do a fly
if i could see you in a year,
id wind the months in balls,
and put them each in separate drawers,
until their time befalls
if only centuries delayed,
id count them on my hand,
subtracting till my fingers dropped
into van diemens land
if certain, when this life was out,
that yours and mine should be,
id toss it yonder like a rind,
and taste eternity
but now, all ignorant of the length
of times uncertain wing,
it goads me, like the goblin bee,
that will not state its sting
vii
with a flower
i hide myself within my flower,
that wearing on your breast,
you, unsuspecting, wear me too --
and angels know the rest
i hide myself within my flower,
that, fading from your vase,
you, unsuspecting, feel for me
almost a loneliness
viii
proof
that i did always love,
i bring thee proof
that till i loved
i did not love enough
that i shall love alway,
i offer thee
that love is life,
and life hath immortality
this, dost thou doubt, sweet?
then have i
nothing to show
but calvary
ix
have you got a brook in your little heart,
where bashful flowers blow,
and blushing birds go down to drink,
and shadows tremble so?
and nobody knows, so still it flows,
that any brook is there
and yet your little draught of life
is daily drunken there
then look out for the little brook in march,
when the rivers overflow,
and the snows come hurrying from the hills,
and the bridges often go
and later, in august it may be,
when the meadows parching lie,
beware, lest this little brook of life
some burning noon go dry
x
transplanted
as if some little arctic flower,
upon the polar hem,
went wandering down the latitudes,
until it puzzled came
to continents of summer,
to firmaments of sun,
to strange, bright crowds of flowers,
and birds of foreign tongue
i say, as if this little flower
to eden wandered in --
what then? why, nothing, only,
your inference therefrom
xi
the outlet
my river runs to thee
blue sea, wilt welcome me?
my river waits reply
oh sea, look graciously
ill fetch thee brooks
from spotted nooks, --
say, sea,
take me
xii
in vain
i cannot live with you,
it would be life,
and life is over there
behind the shelf
the sexton keeps the key to,
putting up
our life, his porcelain,
like a cup
discarded of the housewife,
quaint or broken
a newer sevres pleases,
old ones crack
i could not die with you,
for one must wait
to shut the others gaze down, --
you could not
and i, could i stand by
and see you freeze,
without my right of frost,
deaths privilege?
nor could i rise with you,
because your face
would put out jesus,
that new grace
glow plain and foreign
on my homesick eye,
except that you, than he
shone closer by
theyd judge us -- how?
for you served heaven, you know,
or sought to
i could not,
because you saturated sight,
and i had no more eyes
for sordid excellence
as paradise
and were you lost, i would be,
though my name
rang loudest
on the heavenly fame
and were you saved,
and i condemned to be
where you were not,
that self were hell to me
so we must keep apart,
you there, i here,
with just the door ajar
that oceans are,
and prayer,
and that pale sustenance,
despair
xiii
renunciation
there came a day at summers full
entirely for me
i thought that such were for the saints,
where revelations be
the sun, as common, went abroad,
the flowers, accustomed, blew,
as if no soul the solstice passed
that maketh all things new
the time was scarce profaned by speech
the symbol of a word
was needless, as at sacrament
the wardrobe of our lord
each was to each the sealed church,
permitted to commune this time,
lest we too awkward show
at supper of the lamb
the hours slid fast, as hours will,
clutched tight by greedy hands
so faces on two decks look back,
bound to opposing lands
and so, when all the time had failed,
without external sound,
each bound the others crucifix,
we gave no other bond
sufficient troth that we shall rise --
deposed, at length, the grave --
to that new marriage, justified
through calvaries of love
xiv
loves baptism
im ceded, ive stopped being theirs
the name they dropped upon my face
with water, in the country church,
is finished using now,
and they can put it with my dolls,
my childhood, and the string of spools
ive finished threading too
baptized before without the choice,
but this time consciously, of grace
unto supremest name,
called to my full, the crescent dropped,
existences whole arc filled up
with one small diadem
my second rank, too small the first,
crowned, crowing on my fathers breast,
a half unconscious queen
but this time, adequate, erect,
with will to choose or to reject
and i choose -- just a throne
xv
resurrection
t was a long parting, but the time
for interview had come
before the judgment-seat of god,
the last and second time
these fleshless lovers met,
a heaven in a gaze,
a heaven of heavens, the privilege
of one anothers eyes
no lifetime set on them,
apparelled as the new
unborn, except they had beheld,
born everlasting now
was bridal eer like this?
a paradise, the host,
and cherubim and seraphim
the most familiar guest
xvi
apocalypse
im wife ive finished that,
that other state
im czar, im woman now
its safer so
how odd the girls life looks
behind this soft eclipse
i think that earth seems so
to those in heaven now
this being comfort, then
that other kind was pain
but why compare?
im wife stop there
xvii
the wife
she rose to his requirement, dropped
the playthings of her life
to take the honorable work
of woman and of wife
if aught she missed in her new day
of amplitude, or awe,
or first prospective, or the gold
in using wore away,
it lay unmentioned, as the sea
develops pearl and weed,
but only to himself is known
the fathoms they abide
xviii
apotheosis
come slowly, eden
lips unused to thee,
bashful, sip thy jasmines,
as the fainting bee,
reaching late his flower,
round her chamber hums,
counts his nectars -- enters,
and is lost in balms
iii nature
i
new feet within my garden go,
new fingers stir the sod
a troubadour upon the elm
betrays the solitude
new children play upon the green,
new weary sleep below
and still the pensive spring returns,
and still the punctual snow
ii
may-flower
pink, small, and punctual,
aromatic, low,
covert in april,
candid in may,
dear to the moss,
known by the knoll,
next to the robin
in every human soul
bold little beauty,
bedecked with thee,
nature forswears
antiquity
iii
why?
the murmur of a bee
a witchcraft yieldeth me
if any ask me why,
t were easier to die
than tell
the red upon the hill
taketh away my will
if anybody sneer,
take care, for god is here,
thats all
the breaking of the day
addeth to my degree
if any ask me how,
artist, who drew me so,
must tell
iv
perhaps youd like to buy a flower?
but i could never sell
if you would like to borrow
until the daffodil
unties her yellow bonnet
beneath the village door,
until the bees, from clover rows
their hock and sherry draw,
why, i will lend until just then,
but not an hour more
v
the pedigree of honey
does not concern the bee
a clover, any time, to him
is aristocracy
vi
a service of song
some keep the sabbath going to church
i keep it staying at home,
with a bobolink for a chorister,
and an orchard for a dome
some keep the sabbath in surplice
i just wear my wings,
and instead of tolling the bell for church,
our little sexton sings
god preaches, -- a noted clergyman, --
and the sermon is never long
so instead of getting to heaven at last,
im going all along
vii
the bee is not afraid of me,
i know the butterfly
the pretty people in the woods
receive me cordially
the brooks laugh louder when i come,
the breezes madder play
wherefore, mine eyes, thy silver mists?
wherefore, o summers day?
viii
summers armies
some rainbow coming from the fair
some vision of the world cashmere
i confidently see
or else a peacocks purple train,
feather by feather, on the plain
fritters itself away
the dreamy butterflies bestir,
lethargic pools resume the whir
of last years sundered tune
from some old fortress on the sun
baronial bees march, one by one,
in murmuring platoon
the robins stand as thick to-day
as flakes of snow stood yesterday,
on fence and roof and twig
the orchis binds her feather on
for her old lover, don the sun,
revisiting the bog
without commander, countless, still,
the regiment of wood and hill
in bright detachment stand
behold whose multitudes are these?
the children of whose turbaned seas,
or what circassian land?
ix
the grass
the grass so little has to do, --
a sphere of simple green,
with only butterflies to brood,
and bees to entertain,
and stir all day to pretty tunes
the breezes fetch along,
and hold the sunshine in its lap
and bow to everything
and thread the dews all night, like pearls,
and make itself so fine, --
a duchess were too common
for such a noticing
and even when it dies, to pass
in odors so divine,
as lowly spices gone to sleep,
or amulets of pine
and then to dwell in sovereign barns,
and dream the days away, --
the grass so little has to do,
i wish i were the hay
x
a little road not made of man,
enabled of the eye,
accessible to thill of bee,
or cart of butterfly
if town it have, beyond itself,
t is that i cannot say
i only sigh, -- no vehicle
bears me along that way
xi
summer shower
a drop fell on the apple tree,
another on the roof
a half a dozen kissed the eaves,
and made the gables laugh
a few went out to help the brook,
that went to help the sea
myself conjectured, were they pearls,
what necklaces could be
the dust replaced in hoisted roads,
the birds jocoser sung
the sunshine threw his hat away,
the orchards spangles hung
the breezes brought dejected lutes,
and bathed them in the glee
the east put out a single flag,
and signed the fete away
xii
psalm of the day
a something in a summers day,
as slow her flambeaux burn away,
which solemnizes me
a something in a summers noon, --
an azure depth, a wordless tune,
transcending ecstasy
and still within a summers night
a something so transporting bright,
i clap my hands to see
then veil my too inspecting face,
lest such a subtle, shimmering grace
flutter too far for me
the wizard-fingers never rest,
the purple brook within the breast
still chafes its narrow bed
still rears the east her amber flag,
guides still the sun along the crag
his caravan of red,
like flowers that heard the tale of dews,
but never deemed the dripping prize
awaited their low brows
or bees, that thought the summers name
some rumor of delirium
no summer could for them
or arctic creature, dimly stirred
by tropic hint, -- some travelled bird
imported to the wood
or winds bright signal to the ear,
making that homely and severe,
contented, known, before
the heaven unexpected came,
to lives that thought their worshipping
a too presumptuous psalm
xiii
the sea of sunset
this is the land the sunset washes,
these are the banks of the yellow sea
where it rose, or whither it rushes,
these are the western mystery
night after night her purple traffic
strews the landing with opal bales
merchantmen poise upon horizons,
dip, and vanish with fairy sails
xiv
purple clover
there is a flower that bees prefer,
and butterflies desire
to gain the purple democrat
the humming-birds aspire
and whatsoever insect pass,
a honey bears away
proportioned to his several dearth
and her capacity
her face is rounder than the moon,
and ruddier than the gown
of orchis in the pasture,
or rhododendron worn
she doth not wait for june
before the world is green
her sturdy little countenance
against the wind is seen,
contending with the grass,
near kinsman to herself,
for privilege of sod and sun,
sweet litigants for life
and when the hills are full,
and newer fashions blow,
doth not retract a single spice
for pang of jealousy
her public is the noon,
her providence the sun,
her progress by the bee proclaimed
in sovereign, swerveless tune
the bravest of the host,
surrendering the last,
nor even of defeat aware
when cancelled by the frost
xv
the bee
like trains of cars on tracks of plush
i hear the level bee
a jar across the flowers goes,
their velvet masonry
withstands until the sweet assault
their chivalry consumes,
while he, victorious, tilts away
to vanquish other blooms
his feet are shod with gauze,
his helmet is of gold
his breast, a single onyx
with chrysoprase, inlaid
his labor is a chant,
his idleness a tune
oh, for a bees experience
of clovers and of noon
xvi
presentiment is that long shadow on the lawn
indicative that suns go down
the notice to the startled grass
that darkness is about to pass
xvii
as children bid the guest good-night,
and then reluctant turn,
my flowers raise their pretty lips,
then put their nightgowns on
as children caper when they wake,
merry that it is morn,
my flowers from a hundred cribs
will peep, and prance again
xviii
angels in the early morning
may be seen the dews among,
stooping, plucking, smiling, flying
do the buds to them belong?
angels when the sun is hottest
may be seen the sands among,
stooping, plucking, sighing, flying
parched the flowers they bear along
xix
so bashful when i spied her,
so pretty, so ashamed
so hidden in her leaflets,
lest anybody find
so breathless till i passed her,
so helpless when i turned
and bore her, struggling, blushing,
her simple haunts beyond
for whom i robbed the dingle,
for whom betrayed the dell,
many will doubtless ask me,
but i shall never tell
xx
two worlds
it makes no difference abroad,
the seasons fit the same,
the mornings blossom into noons,
and split their pods of flame
wild-flowers kindle in the woods,
the brooks brag all the day
no blackbird bates his jargoning
for passing calvary
auto-da-fe and judgment
are nothing to the bee
his separation from his rose
to him seems misery
xxi
the mountain
the mountain sat upon the plain
in his eternal chair,
his observation omnifold,
his inquest everywhere
the seasons prayed around his knees,
like children round a sire
grandfather of the days is he,
of dawn the ancestor
xxii
a day
ill tell you how the sun rose, --
a ribbon at a time
the steeples swam in amethyst,
the news like squirrels ran
the hills untied their bonnets,
the bobolinks begun
then i said softly to myself,
that must have been the sun

but how he set, i know not
there seemed a purple stile
which little yellow boys and girls
were climbing all the while
till when they reached the other side,
a dominie in gray
put gently up the evening bars,
and led the flock away
xxiii
the butterflys assumption-gown,
in chrysoprase apartments hung,
this afternoon put on
how condescending to descend,
and be of buttercups the friend
in a new england town
xxiv
the wind
of all the sounds despatched abroad,
theres not a charge to me
like that old measure in the boughs,
that phraseless melody
the wind does, working like a hand
whose fingers brush the sky,
then quiver down, with tufts of tune
permitted gods and me
when winds go round and round in bands,
and thrum upon the door,
and birds take places overhead,
to bear them orchestra,
i crave him grace, of summer boughs,
if such an outcast be,
he never heard that fleshless chant
rise solemn in the tree,
as if some caravan of sound
on deserts, in the sky,
had broken rank,
then knit, and passed
in seamless company
xxv
death and life
apparently with no surprise
to any happy flower,
the frost beheads it at its play
in accidental power
the blond assassin passes on,
the sun proceeds unmoved
to measure off another day
for an approving god
xxvi
t was later when the summer went
than when the cricket came,
and yet we knew that gentle clock
meant nought but going home
t was sooner when the cricket went
than when the winter came,
yet that pathetic pendulum
keeps esoteric time
xxvii
indian summer
these are the days when birds come back,
a very few, a bird or two,
to take a backward look
these are the days when skies put on
the old, old sophistries of june, --
a blue and gold mistake
oh, fraud that cannot cheat the bee,
almost thy plausibility
induces my belief,
till ranks of seeds their witness bear,
and softly through the altered air
hurries a timid leaf
oh, sacrament of summer days,
oh, last communion in the haze,
permit a child to join,
thy sacred emblems to partake,
thy consecrated bread to break,
taste thine immortal wine
xxviii
autumn
the morns are meeker than they were,
the nuts are getting brown
the berrys cheek is plumper,
the rose is out of town
the maple wears a gayer scarf,
the field a scarlet gown
lest i should be old-fashioned,
ill put a trinket on
xxix
beclouded
the sky is low, the clouds are mean,
a travelling flake of snow
across a barn or through a rut
debates if it will go
a narrow wind complains all day
how some one treated him
nature, like us, is sometimes caught
without her diadem
xxx
the hemlock
i think the hemlock likes to stand
upon a marge of snow
it suits his own austerity,
and satisfies an awe
that men must slake in wilderness,
or in the desert cloy, --
an instinct for the hoar, the bald,
laplands necessity
the hemlocks nature thrives on cold
the gnash of northern winds
is sweetest nutriment to him,
his best norwegian wines
to satin races he is nought
but children on the don
beneath his tabernacles play,
and dnieper wrestlers run
xxxi
theres a certain slant of light,
on winter afternoons,
that oppresses, like the weight
of cathedral tunes
heavenly hurt it gives us
we can find no scar,
but internal difference
where the meanings are
none may teach it anything,
t is the seal, despair, --
an imperial affliction
sent us of the air
when it comes, the landscape listens,
shadows hold their breath
when it goes, t is like the distance
on the look of death
iv time and eternity
i
one dignity delays for all,
one mitred afternoon
none can avoid this purple,
none evade this crown
coach it insures, and footmen,
chamber and state and throng
bells, also, in the village,
as we ride grand along
what dignified attendants,
what service when we pause
how loyally at parting
their hundred hats they raise
how pomp surpassing ermine,
when simple you and i
present our meek escutcheon,
and claim the rank to die
ii
too late
delayed till she had ceased to know,
delayed till in its vest of snow
her loving bosom lay
an hour behind the fleeting breath,
later by just an hour than death, --
oh, lagging yesterday
could she have guessed that it would be
could but a crier of the glee
have climbed the distant hill
had not the bliss so slow a pace, --
who knows but this surrendered face
were undefeated still?
oh, if there may departing be
any forgot by victory
in her imperial round,
show them this meek apparelled thing,
that could not stop to be a king,
doubtful if it be crowned
iii
astra castra
departed to the judgment,
a mighty afternoon
great clouds like ushers leaning,
creation looking on
the flesh surrendered, cancelled,
the bodiless begun
two worlds, like audiences, disperse
and leave the soul alone
iv
safe in their alabaster chambers,
untouched by morning and untouched by noon,
sleep the meek members of the resurrection,
rafter of satin, and roof of stone
light laughs the breeze in her castle of sunshine
babbles the bee in a stolid ear
pipe the sweet birds in ignorant cadence, --
ah, what sagacity perished here
grand go the years in the crescent above them
worlds scoop their arcs, and firmaments row,
diadems drop and doges surrender,
soundless as dots on a disk of snow
v
on this long storm the rainbow rose,
on this late morn the sun
the clouds, like listless elephants,
horizons straggled down
the birds rose smiling in their nests,
the gales indeed were done
alas how heedless were the eyes
on whom the summer shone
the quiet nonchalance of death
no daybreak can bestir
the slow archangels syllables
must awaken her
vi
from the chrysalis
my cocoon tightens, colors tease,
im feeling for the air
a dim capacity for wings
degrades the dress i wear
a power of butterfly must be
the aptitude to fly,
meadows of majesty concedes
and easy sweeps of sky
so i must baffle at the hint
and cipher at the sign,
and make much blunder, if at last
i take the clew divine
vii
setting sail
exultation is the going
of an inland soul to sea, --
past the houses, past the headlands,
into deep eternity
bred as we, among the mountains,
can the sailor understand
the divine intoxication
of the first league out from land?
viii
look back on time with kindly eyes,
he doubtless did his best
how softly sinks his trembling sun
in human natures west
ix
a train went through a burial gate,
a bird broke forth and sang,
and trilled, and quivered, and shook his throat
till all the churchyard rang
and then adjusted his little notes,
and bowed and sang again
doubtless, he thought it meet of him
to say good-by to men
x
i died for beauty, but was scarce
adjusted in the tomb,
when one who died for truth was lain
in an adjoining room
he questioned softly why i failed?
for beauty, i replied
and i for truth, -- the two are one
we brethren are, he said
and so, as kinsmen met a night,
we talked between the rooms,
until the moss had reached our lips,
and covered up our names
xi
troubled about many things
how many times these low feet staggered,
only the soldered mouth can tell
try can you stir the awful rivet?
try can you lift the hasps of steel?
stroke the cool forehead, hot so often,
lift, if you can, the listless hair
handle the adamantine fingers
never a thimble more shall wear
buzz the dull flies on the chamber window
brave shines the sun through the freckled pane
fearless the cobweb swings from the ceiling --
indolent housewife, in daisies lain
xii
real
i like a look of agony,
because i know it s true
men do not sham convulsion,
nor simulate a throe
the eyes glaze once, and that is death
impossible to feign
the beads upon the forehead
by homely anguish strung
xiii
the funeral
that short, potential stir
that each can make but once,
that bustle so illustrious
t is almost consequence,
is the eclat of death
oh, thou unknown renown
that not a beggar would accept,
had he the power to spurn
xiv
i went to thank her,
but she slept
her bed a funnelled stone,
with nosegays at the head and foot,
that travellers had thrown,
who went to thank her
but she slept
t was short to cross the sea
to look upon her like, alive,
but turning back t was slow
xv
ive seen a dying eye
run round and round a room
in search of something, as it seemed,
then cloudier become
and then, obscure with fog,
and then be soldered down,
without disclosing what it be,
t were blessed to have seen
xvi
refuge
the clouds their backs together laid,
the north begun to push,
the forests galloped till they fell,
the lightning skipped like mice
the thunder crumbled like a stuff --
how good to be safe in tombs,
where natures temper cannot reach,
nor vengeance ever comes
xvii
i never saw a moor,
i never saw the sea
yet know i how the heather looks,
and what a wave must be
i never spoke with god,
nor visited in heaven
yet certain am i of the spot
as if the chart were given
xviii
playmates
god permits industrious angels
afternoons to play
i met one, -- forgot my school-mates,
all, for him, straightway
god calls home the angels promptly
at the setting sun
i missed mine how dreary marbles,
after playing crown
xix
to know just how he suffered would be dear
to know if any human eyes were near
to whom he could intrust his wavering gaze,
until it settled firm on paradise
to know if he was patient, part content,
was dying as he thought, or different
was it a pleasant day to die,
and did the sunshine face his way?
what was his furthest mind, of home, or god,
or what the distant say
at news that he ceased human nature
on such a day?
and wishes, had he any?
just his sigh, accented,
had been legible to me
and was he confident until
ill fluttered out in everlasting well?
and if he spoke, what name was best,
what first,
what one broke off with
at the drowsiest?
was he afraid, or tranquil?
might he know
how conscious consciousness could grow,
till love that was, and love too blest to be,
meet -- and the junction be eternity?
xx
the last night that she lived,
it was a common night,
except the dying this to us
made nature different
we noticed smallest things, --
things overlooked before,
by this great light upon our minds
italicized, as t were
that others could exist
while she must finish quite,
a jealousy for her arose
so nearly infinite
we waited while she passed
it was a narrow time,
too jostled were our souls to speak,
at length the notice came
she mentioned, and forgot
then lightly as a reed
bent to the water, shivered scarce,
consented, and was dead
and we, we placed the hair,
and drew the head erect
and then an awful leisure was,
our faith to regulate
xxi
the first lesson
not in this world to see his face
sounds long, until i read the place
where this is said to be
but just the primer to a life
unopened, rare, upon the shelf,
clasped yet to him and me
and yet, my primer suits me so
i would not choose a book to know
than that, be sweeter wise
might some one else so learned be,
and leave me just my a b c,
himself could have the skies
xxii
the bustle in a house
the morning after death
is solemnest of industries
enacted upon earth, --
the sweeping up the heart,
and putting love away
we shall not want to use again
until eternity
xxiii
i reason, earth is short,
and anguish absolute,
and many hurt
but what of that?
i reason, we could die
the best vitality
cannot excel decay
but what of that?
i reason that in heaven
somehow, it will be even,
some new equation given
but what of that?
xxiv
afraid? of whom am i afraid?
not death for who is he?
the porter of my fathers lodge
as much abasheth me
of life? t were odd i fear a thing
that comprehendeth me
in one or more existences
at deitys decree
of resurrection? is the east
afraid to trust the morn
with her fastidious forehead?
as soon impeach my crown
xxv
dying
the sun kept setting, setting still
no hue of afternoon
upon the village i perceived, --
from house to house t was noon
the dusk kept dropping, dropping still
no dew upon the grass,
but only on my forehead stopped,
and wandered in my face
my feet kept drowsing, drowsing still,
my fingers were awake
yet why so little sound myself
unto my seeming make?
how well i knew the light before
i could not see it now
t is dying, i am doing but
im not afraid to know
xxvi
two swimmers wrestled on the spar
until the morning sun,
when one turned smiling to the land
o god, the other one
the stray ships passing spied a face
upon the waters borne,
with eyes in death still begging raised,
and hands beseeching thrown
xxvii
the chariot
because i could not stop for death,
he kindly stopped for me
the carriage held but just ourselves
and immortality
we slowly drove, he knew no haste,
and i had put away
my labor, and my leisure too,
for his civility
we passed the school where children played,
their lessons scarcely done
we passed the fields of gazing grain,
we passed the setting sun
we paused before a house that seemed
a swelling of the ground
the roof was scarcely visible,
the cornice but a mound
since then t is centuries but each
feels shorter than the day
i first surmised the horses heads
were toward eternity
xxviii
she went as quiet as the dew
from a familiar flower
not like the dew did she return
at the accustomed hour
she dropt as softly as a star
from out my summers eve
less skilful than leverrier
its sorer to believe
xxix
resurgam
at last to be identified
at last, the lamps upon thy side,
the rest of life to see
past midnight, past the morning star
past sunrise ah what leagues there are
between our feet and day
xxx
except to heaven, she is nought
except for angels, lone
except to some wide-wandering bee,
a flower superfluous blown
except for winds, provincial
except by butterflies,
unnoticed as a single dew
that on the acre lies
the smallest housewife in the grass,
yet take her from the lawn,
and somebody has lost the face
that made existence home
xxxi
death is a dialogue between
the spirit and the dust
dissolve, says death the spirit, sir,
i have another trust
death doubts it, argues from the ground
the spirit turns away,
just laying off, for evidence,
an overcoat of clay
xxxii
it was too late for man,
but early yet for god
creation impotent to help,
but prayer remained our side
how excellent the heaven,
when earth cannot be had
how hospitable, then, the face
of our old neighbor, god
xxxiii
along the potomac
when i was small, a woman died
to-day her only boy
went up from the potomac,
his face all victory,
to look at her how slowly
the seasons must have turned
till bullets clipt an angle,
and he passed quickly round
if pride shall be in paradise
i never can decide
of their imperial conduct,
no person testified
but proud in apparition,
that woman and her boy
pass back and forth before my brain,
as ever in the sky
xxxiv
the daisy follows soft the sun,
and when his golden walk is done,
sits shyly at his feet
he, waking, finds the flower near
wherefore, marauder, art thou here?
because, sir, love is sweet
we are the flower, thou the sun
forgive us, if as days decline,
we nearer steal to thee, --
enamoured of the parting west,
the peace, the flight, the amethyst,
nights possibility
xxxv
emancipation
no rack can torture me,
my souls at liberty
behind this mortal bone
there knits a bolder one
you cannot prick with saw,
nor rend with scymitar
two bodies therefore be
bind one, and one will flee
the eagle of his nest
no easier divest
and gain the sky,
than mayest thou,
except thyself may be
thine enemy
captivity is consciousness,
sos liberty
xxxvi
lost
i lost a world the other day
has anybody found?
youll know it by the row of stars
around its forehead bound
a rich man might not notice it
yet to my frugal eye
of more esteem than ducats
oh, find it, sir, for me
xxxvii
if i shouldnt be alive
when the robins come,
give the one in red cravat
a memorial crumb
if i couldnt thank you,
being just asleep,
you will know im trying
with my granite lip
xxxviii
sleep is supposed to be,
by souls of sanity,
the shutting of the eye
sleep is the station grand
down which on either hand
the hosts of witness stand
morn is supposed to be,
by people of degree,
the breaking of the day
morning has not occurred
that shall aurora be
east of eternity
one with the banner gay,
one in the red array, --
that is the break of day
xxxix
i shall know why, when time is over,
and i have ceased to wonder why
christ will explain each separate anguish
in the fair schoolroom of the sky
he will tell me what peter promised,
and i, for wonder at his woe,
i shall forget the drop of anguish
that scalds me now, that scalds me now
xl
i never lost as much but twice,
and that was in the sod
twice have i stood a beggar
before the door of god
angels, twice descending,
reimbursed my store
burglar, banker, father,
i am poor once more
my nosegays are for captives
dim, long-expectant eyes,
fingers denied the plucking,
patient till paradise,
to such, if they should whisper
of morning and the moor,
they bear no other errand,
and i, no other prayer
i life
i
im nobody  who are you?
are you nobody, too?
then there s a pair of us -- dont tell
they d banish us, you know
how dreary to be somebody
how public, like a frog
to tell your name the livelong day
to an admiring bog
ii
i bring an unaccustomed wine
to lips long parching, next to mine,
and summon them to drink
crackling with fever, they essay
i turn my brimming eyes away,
and come next hour to look
the hands still hug the tardy glass
the lips i would have cooled, alas
are so superfluous cold,
i would as soon attempt to warm
the bosoms where the frost has lain
ages beneath the mould
some other thirsty there may be
to whom this would have pointed me
had it remained to speak
and so i always bear the cup
if, haply, mine may be the drop
some pilgrim thirst to slake, --
if, haply, any say to me,
unto the little, unto me,
when i at last awake
iii
the nearest dream recedes, unrealized
the heaven we chase
like the june bee
before the school-boy
invites the race
stoops to an easy clover --
dips -- evades -- teases -- deploys
then to the royal clouds
lifts his light pinnace
heedless of the boy
staring, bewildered, at the mocking sky
homesick for steadfast honey,
ah the bee flies not
that brews that rare variety
iv
we play at paste,
till qualified for pearl,
then drop the paste,
and deem ourself a fool
the shapes, though, were similar,
and our new hands
learned gem-tactics
practising sands
v
i found the phrase to every thought
i ever had, but one
and that defies me, -- as a hand
did try to chalk the sun
to races nurtured in the dark --
how would your own begin?
can blaze be done in cochineal,
or noon in mazarin?
vi
hope
hope is the thing with feathers
that perches in the soul,
and sings the tune without the words,
and never stops at all,
and sweetest in the gale is heard
and sore must be the storm
that could abash the little bird
that kept so many warm
i ve heard it in the chillest land,
and on the strangest sea
yet, never, in extremity,
it asked a crumb of me
vii
the white heat
dare you see a soul at the white heat?
then crouch within the door
red is the fires common tint
but when the vivid ore
has sated flames conditions,
its quivering substance plays
without a color but the light
of unanointed blaze
least village boasts its blacksmith,
whose anvils even din
stands symbol for the finer forge
that soundless tugs within,
refining these impatient ores
with hammer and with blaze,
until the designated light
repudiate the forge
viii
triumphant
who never lost, are unprepared
a coronet to find
who never thirsted, flagons
and cooling tamarind
who never climbed the weary league --
can such a foot explore
the purple territories
on pizarros shore?
how many legions overcome?
the emperor will say
how many colors taken
on revolution day?
how many bullets bearest?
the royal scar hast thou?
angels, write promoted
on this soldiers brow
ix
the test
i can wade grief,
whole pools of it, --
i m used to that
but the least push of joy
breaks up my feet,
and i tip -- drunken
let no pebble smile,
t was the new liquor, --
that was all
power is only pain,
stranded, through discipline,
till weights will hang
give balm to giants,
and they ll wilt, like men
give himmaleh, --
they ll carry him
x
escape
i never hear the word escape
without a quicker blood,
a sudden expectation,
a flying attitude
i never hear of prisons broad
by soldiers battered down,
but i tug childish at my bars, --
only to fail again
xi
compensation
for each ecstatic instant
we must an anguish pay
in keen and quivering ratio
to the ecstasy
for each beloved hour
sharp pittances of years,
bitter contested farthings
and coffers heaped with tears
xii
the martyrs
through the straight pass of suffering
the martyrs even trod,
their feet upon temptation,
their faces upon god
a stately, shriven company
convulsion playing round,
harmless as streaks of meteor
upon a planets bound
their faith the everlasting troth
their expectation fair
the needle to the north degree
wades so, through polar air
xiii
a prayer
i meant to have but modest needs,
such as content, and heaven
within my income these could lie,
and life and i keep even
but since the last included both,
it would suffice my prayer
but just for one to stipulate,
and grace would grant the pair
and so, upon this wise i prayed, --
great spirit, give to me
a heaven not so large as yours,
but large enough for me
a smile suffused jehovahs face
the cherubim withdrew
grave saints stole out to look at me,
and showed their dimples, too
i left the place with all my might, --
my prayer away i threw
the quiet ages picked it up,
and judgment twinkled, too,
that one so honest be extant
as take the tale for true
that whatsoever you shall ask,
itself be given you
but i, grown shrewder, scan the skies
with a suspicious air, --
as children, swindled for the first,
all swindlers be, infer
xiv
the thought beneath so slight a film
is more distinctly seen, --
as laces just reveal the surge,
or mists the apennine
xv
the soul unto itself
is an imperial friend, --
or the most agonizing spy
an enemy could send
secure against its own,
no treason it can fear
itself its sovereign, of itself
the soul should stand in awe
xvi
surgeons must be very careful
when they take the knife
underneath their fine incisions
stirs the culprit, -- life
xvii
the railway train
i like to see it lap the miles,
and lick the valleys up,
and stop to feed itself at tanks
and then, prodigious, step
around a pile of mountains,
and, supercilious, peer
in shanties by the sides of roads
and then a quarry pare
to fit its sides, and crawl between,
complaining all the while
in horrid, hooting stanza
then chase itself down hill
and neigh like boanerges
then, punctual as a star,
stop -- docile and omnipotent --
at its own stable door
xviii
the show
the show is not the show,
but they that go
menagerie to me
my neighbor be
fair play --
both went to see
xix
delight becomes pictorial
when viewed through pain, --
more fair, because impossible
that any gain
the mountain at a given distance
in amber lies
approached, the amber flits a little, --
and that s the skies
xx
a thought went up my mind to-day
that i have had before,
but did not finish, -- some way back,
i could not fix the year,
nor where it went, nor why it came
the second time to me,
nor definitely what it was,
have i the art to say
but somewhere in my soul, i know
i ve met the thing before
it just reminded me -- t was all --
and came my way no more
xxi
is heaven a physician?
they say that he can heal
but medicine posthumous
is unavailable
is heaven an exchequer?
they speak of what we owe
but that negotiation
i m not a party to
xxii
the return
though i get home how late, how late
so i get home, t will compensate
better will be the ecstasy
that they have done expecting me,
when, night descending, dumb and dark,
they hear my unexpected knock
transporting must the moment be,
brewed from decades of agony
to think just how the fire will burn,
just how long-cheated eyes will turn
to wonder what myself will say,
and what itself will say to me,
beguiles the centuries of way
xxiii
a poor torn heart, a tattered heart,
that sat it down to rest,
nor noticed that the ebbing day
flowed silver to the west,
nor noticed night did soft descend
nor constellation burn,
intent upon the vision
of latitudes unknown
the angels, happening that way,
this dusty heart espied
tenderly took it up from toil
and carried it to god
there, -- sandals for the barefoot
there, -- gathered from the gales,
do the blue havens by the hand
lead the wandering sails
xxiv
too much
i should have been too glad, i see,
too lifted for the scant degree
of lifes penurious round
my little circuit would have shamed
this new circumference, have blamed
the homelier time behind
i should have been too saved, i see,
too rescued fear too dim to me
that i could spell the prayer
i knew so perfect yesterday, --
that scalding one, sabachthani,
recited fluent here
earth would have been too much, i see,
and heaven not enough for me
i should have had the joy
without the fear to justify, --
the palm without the calvary
so, saviour, crucify
defeat whets victory, they say
the reefs in old gethsemane
endear the shore beyond
t is beggars banquets best define
t is thirsting vitalizes wine, --
faith faints to understand
xxv
shipwreck
it tossed and tossed, --
a little brig i knew, --
oertook by blast,
it spun and spun,
and groped delirious, for morn
it slipped and slipped,
as one that drunken stepped
its white foot tripped,
then dropped from sight
ah, brig, good-night
to crew and you
the oceans heart too smooth, too blue,
to break for you
xxvi
victory comes late,
and is held low to freezing lips
too rapt with frost
to take it
how sweet it would have tasted,
just a drop
was god so economical?
his table s spread too high for us
unless we dine on tip-toe
crumbs fit such little mouths,
cherries suit robins
the eagles golden breakfast
strangles them
god keeps his oath to sparrows,
who of little love
know how to starve
xxvii
enough
god gave a loaf to every bird,
but just a crumb to me
i dare not eat it, though i starve, --
my poignant luxury
to own it, touch it, prove the feat
that made the pellet mine, --
too happy in my sparrow chance
for ampler coveting
it might be famine all around,
i could not miss an ear,
such plenty smiles upon my board,
my garner shows so fair
i wonder how the rich may feel, --
an indiaman -- an earl?
i deem that i with but a crumb
am sovereign of them all
xxviii
experiment to me
is every one i meet
if it contain a kernel?
the figure of a nut
presents upon a tree,
equally plausibly
but meat within is requisite,
to squirrels and to me
xxix
my countrys wardrobe
my country need not change her gown,
her triple suit as sweet
as when t was cut at lexington,
and first pronounced a fit
great britain disapproves the stars
disparagement discreet, --
there s something in their attitude
that taunts her bayonet
xxx
faith is a fine invention
for gentlemen who see
but microscopes are prudent
in an emergency
xxxi
except the heaven had come so near,
so seemed to choose my door,
the distance would not haunt me so
i had not hoped before
but just to hear the grace depart
i never thought to see,
afflicts me with a double loss
t is lost, and lost to me
xxxii
portraits are to daily faces
as an evening west
to a fine, pedantic sunshine
in a satin vest
xxxiii
the duel
i took my power in my hand
and went against the world
t was not so much as david had,
but i was twice as bold
i aimed my pebble, but myself
was all the one that fell
was it goliath was too large,
or only i too small?
xxxiv
a shady friend for torrid days
is easier to find
than one of higher temperature
for frigid hour of mind
the vane a little to the east
scares muslin souls away
if broadcloth breasts are firmer
than those of organdy,
who is to blame? the weaver?
ah the bewildering thread
the tapestries of paradise
so notelessly are made
xxxv
the goal
each life converges to some centre
expressed or still
exists in every human nature
a goal,
admitted scarcely to itself, it may be,
too fair
for credibilitys temerity
to dare
adored with caution, as a brittle heaven,
to reach
were hopeless as the rainbows raiment
to touch,
yet persevered toward, surer for the distance
how high
unto the saints slow diligence
the sky
ungained, it may be, by a lifes low venture,
but then,
eternity enables the endeavoring
again
xxxvi
sight
before i got my eye put out,
i liked as well to see
as other creatures that have eyes,
and know no other way
but were it told to me, to-day,
that i might have the sky
for mine, i tell you that my heart
would split, for size of me
the meadows mine, the mountains mine, --
all forests, stintless stars,
as much of noon as i could take
between my finite eyes
the motions of the dipping birds,
the lightnings jointed road,
for mine to look at when i liked, --
the news would strike me dead
so safer, guess, with just my soul
upon the window-pane
where other creatures put their eyes,
incautious of the sun
xxxvii
talk with prudence to a beggar
of potosi and the mines
reverently to the hungry
of your viands and your wines
cautious, hint to any captive
you have passed enfranchised feet
anecdotes of air in dungeons
have sometimes proved deadly sweet
xxxviii
the preacher
he preached upon breadth till it argued him narrow, --
the broad are too broad to define
and of truth until it proclaimed him a liar, --
the truth never flaunted a sign
simplicity fled from his counterfeit presence
as gold the pyrites would shun
what confusion would cover the innocent jesus
to meet so enabled a man
xxxix
good night which put the candle out?
a jealous zephyr, not a doubt
ah friend, you little knew
how long at that celestial wick
the angels labored diligent
extinguished, now, for you
it might have been the lighthouse spark
some sailor, rowing in the dark,
had importuned to see
it might have been the waning lamp
that lit the drummer from the camp
to purer reveille
xl
when i hoped i feared,
since i hoped i dared
everywhere alone
as a church remain
spectre cannot harm,
serpent cannot charm
he deposes doom,
who hath suffered him
xli
deed
a deed knocks first at thought,
and then it knocks at will
that is the manufacturing spot,
and will at home and well
it then goes out an act,
or is entombed so still
that only to the ear of god
its doom is audible
xlii
times lesson
mine enemy is growing old, --
i have at last revenge
the palate of the hate departs
if any would avenge, --
let him be quick, the viand flits,
it is a faded meat
anger as soon as fed is dead
t is starving makes it fat
xliii
remorse
remorse is memory awake,
her companies astir, --
a presence of departed acts
at window and at door
its past set down before the soul,
and lighted with a match,
perusal to facilitate
of its condensed despatch
remorse is cureless, -- the disease
not even god can heal
for t is his institution, --
the complement of hell
xliv
the shelter
the body grows outside, --
the more convenient way, --
that if the spirit like to hide,
its temple stands alway
ajar, secure, inviting
it never did betray
the soul that asked its shelter
in timid honesty
xlv
undue significance a starving man attaches
to food
far off he sighs, and therefore hopeless,
and therefore good
partaken, it relieves indeed, but proves us
that spices fly
in the receipt it was the distance
was savory
xlvi
heart not so heavy as mine,
wending late home,
as it passed my window
whistled itself a tune, --
a careless snatch, a ballad,
a ditty of the street
yet to my irritated ear
an anodyne so sweet,
it was as if a bobolink,
sauntering this way,
carolled and mused and carolled,
then bubbled slow away
it was as if a chirping brook
upon a toilsome way
set bleeding feet to minuets
without the knowing why
to-morrow, night will come again,
weary, perhaps, and sore
ah, bugle, by my window,
i pray you stroll once more
xlvii
i many times thought peace had come,
when peace was far away
as wrecked men deem they sight the land
at centre of the sea,
and struggle slacker, but to prove,
as hopelessly as i,
how many the fictitious shores
before the harbor lie
xlviii
unto my books so good to turn
far ends of tired days
it half endears the abstinence,
and pain is missed in praise
as flavors cheer retarded guests
with banquetings to be,
so spices stimulate the time
till my small library
it may be wilderness without,
far feet of failing men,
but holiday excludes the night,
and it is bells within
i thank these kinsmen of the shelf
their countenances bland
enamour in prospective,
and satisfy, obtained
xlix
this merit hath the worst, --
it cannot be again
when fate hath taunted last
and thrown her furthest stone,
the maimed may pause and breathe,
and glance securely round
the deer invites no longer
than it eludes the hound
l
hunger
i had been hungry all the years
my noon had come, to dine
i, trembling, drew the table near,
and touched the curious wine
t was this on tables i had seen,
when turning, hungry, lone,
i looked in windows, for the wealth
i could not hope to own
i did not know the ample bread,
t was so unlike the crumb
the birds and i had often shared
in natures dining-room
the plenty hurt me, t was so new, --
myself felt ill and odd,
as berry of a mountain bush
transplanted to the road
nor was i hungry so i found
that hunger was a way
of persons outside windows,
the entering takes away
li
i gained it so,
by climbing slow,
by catching at the twigs that grow
between the bliss and me
it hung so high,
as well the sky
attempt by strategy
i said i gained it, --
this was all
look, how i clutch it,
lest it fall,
and i a pauper go
unfitted by an instants grace
for the contented beggars face
i wore an hour ago
lii
to learn the transport by the pain,
as blind men learn the sun
to die of thirst, suspecting
that brooks in meadows run
to stay the homesick, homesick feet
upon a foreign shore
haunted by native lands, the while,
and blue, beloved air --
this is the sovereign anguish,
this, the signal woe
these are the patient laureates
whose voices, trained below,
ascend in ceaseless carol,
inaudible, indeed,
to us, the duller scholars
of the mysterious bard
liii
returning
i years had been from home,
and now, before the door,
i dared not open, lest a face
i never saw before
stare vacant into mine
and ask my business there
my business, -- just a life i left,
was such still dwelling there?
i fumbled at my nerve,
i scanned the windows near
the silence like an ocean rolled,
and broke against my ear
i laughed a wooden laugh
that i could fear a door,
who danger and the dead had faced,
but never quaked before
i fitted to the latch
my hand, with trembling care,
lest back the awful door should spring,
and leave me standing there
i moved my fingers off
as cautiously as glass,
and held my ears, and like a thief
fled gasping from the house
liv
prayer
prayer is the little implement
through which men reach
where presence is denied them
they fling their speech
by means of it in gods ear
if then he hear,
this sums the apparatus
comprised in prayer
lv
i know that he exists
somewhere, in silence
he has hid his rare life
from our gross eyes
t is an instants play,
t is a fond ambush,
just to make bliss
earn her own surprise
but should the play
prove piercing earnest,
should the glee glaze
in deaths stiff stare,
would not the fun
look too expensive?
would not the jest
have crawled too far?
lvi
melodies unheard
musicians wrestle everywhere
all day, among the crowded air,
i hear the silver strife
and -- waking long before the dawn --
such transport breaks upon the town
i think it that new life
it is not bird, it has no nest
nor band, in brass and scarlet dressed,
nor tambourine, nor man
it is not hymn from pulpit read, --
the morning stars the treble led
on times first afternoon
some say it is the spheres at play
some say that bright majority
of vanished dames and men
some think it service in the place
where we, with late, celestial face,
please god, shall ascertain
lvii
called back
just lost when i was saved
just felt the world go by
just girt me for the onset with eternity,
when breath blew back,
and on the other side
i heard recede the disappointed tide
therefore, as one returned, i feel,
odd secrets of the line to tell
some sailor, skirting foreign shores,
some pale reporter from the awful doors
before the seal
next time, to stay
next time, the things to see
by ear unheard,
unscrutinized by eye
next time, to tarry,
while the ages steal, --
slow tramp the centuries,
and the cycles wheel
ii love
i
choice
of all the souls that stand create
i have elected one
when sense from spirit files away,
and subterfuge is done
when that which is and that which was
apart, intrinsic, stand,
and this brief tragedy of flesh
is shifted like a sand
when figures show their royal front
and mists are carved away, --
behold the atom i preferred
to all the lists of clay
ii
i have no life but this,
to lead it here
nor any death, but lest
dispelled from there
nor tie to earths to come,
nor action new,
except through this extent,
the realm of you
iii
your riches taught me poverty
myself a millionnaire
in little wealths, -- as girls could boast, --
till broad as buenos ayre,
you drifted your dominions
a different peru
and i esteemed all poverty,
for lifes estate with you
of mines i little know, myself,
but just the names of gems, --
the colors of the commonest
and scarce of diadems
so much that, did i meet the queen,
her glory i should know
but this must be a different wealth,
to miss it beggars so
i m sure t is india all day
to those who look on you
without a stint, without a blame, --
might i but be the jew
i m sure it is golconda,
beyond my power to deem, --
to have a smile for mine each day,
how better than a gem
at least, it solaces to know
that there exists a gold,
although i prove it just in time
its distance to behold
it s far, far treasure to surmise,
and estimate the pearl
that slipped my simple fingers through
while just a girl at school
iv
the contract
i gave myself to him,
and took himself for pay
the solemn contract of a life
was ratified this way
the wealth might disappoint,
myself a poorer prove
than this great purchaser suspect,
the daily own of love
depreciate the vision
but, till the merchant buy,
still fable, in the isles of spice,
the subtle cargoes lie
at least, t is mutual risk, --
some found it mutual gain
sweet debt of life, -- each night to owe,
insolvent, every noon
v
the letter
going to him happy letter tell him --
tell him the page i didnt write
tell him i only said the syntax,
and left the verb and the pronoun out
tell him just how the fingers hurried,
then how they waded, slow, slow, slow
and then you wished you had eyes in your pages,
so you could see what moved them so
tell him it wasnt a practised writer,
you guessed, from the way the sentence toiled
you could hear the bodice tug, behind you,
as if it held but the might of a child
you almost pitied it, you, it worked so
tell him -- no, you may quibble there,
for it would split his heart to know it,
and then you and i were silenter
tell him night finished before we finished,
and the old clock kept neighing day
and you got sleepy and begged to be ended --
what could it hinder so, to say?
tell him just how she sealed you, cautious,
but if he ask where you are hid
until to-morrow, -- happy letter
gesture, coquette, and shake your head
vi
the way i read a letter s this
t is first i lock the door,
and push it with my fingers next,
for transport it be sure
and then i go the furthest off
to counteract a knock
then draw my little letter forth
and softly pick its lock
then, glancing narrow at the wall,
and narrow at the floor,
for firm conviction of a mouse
not exorcised before,
peruse how infinite i am
to -- no one that you know
and sigh for lack of heaven, -- but not
the heaven the creeds bestow
vii
wild nights wild nights
were i with thee,
wild nights should be
our luxury
futile the winds
to a heart in port, --
done with the compass,
done with the chart
rowing in eden
ah the sea
might i but moor
to-night in thee
viii
at home
the night was wide, and furnished scant
with but a single star,
that often as a cloud it met
blew out itself for fear
the wind pursued the little bush,
and drove away the leaves
november left then clambered up
and fretted in the eaves
no squirrel went abroad
a dogs belated feet
like intermittent plush were heard
adown the empty street
to feel if blinds be fast,
and closer to the fire
her little rocking-chair to draw,
and shiver for the poor,
the housewifes gentle task
how pleasanter, said she
unto the sofa opposite,
the sleet than may -- no thee
ix
possession
did the harebell loose her girdle
to the lover bee,
would the bee the harebell hallow
much as formerly?
did the paradise, persuaded,
yield her moat of pearl,
would the eden be an eden,
or the earl an earl?
x
a charm invests a face
imperfectly beheld, --
the lady dare not lift her veil
for fear it be dispelled
but peers beyond her mesh,
and wishes, and denies, --
lest interview annul a want
that image satisfies
xi
the lovers
the rose did caper on her cheek,
her bodice rose and fell,
her pretty speech, like drunken men,
did stagger pitiful
her fingers fumbled at her work, --
her needle would not go
what ailed so smart a little maid
it puzzled me to know,
till opposite i spied a cheek
that bore another rose
just opposite, another speech
that like the drunkard goes
a vest that, like the bodice, danced
to the immortal tune, --
till those two troubled little clocks
ticked softly into one
xii
in lands i never saw, they say,
immortal alps look down,
whose bonnets touch the firmament,
whose sandals touch the town, --
meek at whose everlasting feet
a myriad daisies play
which, sir, are you, and which am i,
upon an august day?
xiii
the moon is distant from the sea,
and yet with amber hands
she leads him, docile as a boy,
along appointed sands
he never misses a degree
obedient to her eye,
he comes just so far toward the town,
just so far goes away
oh, signor, thine the amber hand,
and mine the distant sea, --
obedient to the least command
thine eyes impose on me
xiv
he put the belt around my life, --
i heard the buckle snap,
and turned away, imperial,
my lifetime folding up
deliberate, as a duke would do
a kingdoms title-deed, --
henceforth a dedicated sort,
a member of the cloud
yet not too far to come at call,
and do the little toils
that make the circuit of the rest,
and deal occasional smiles
to lives that stoop to notice mine
and kindly ask it in, --
whose invitation, knew you not
for whom i must decline?
xv
the lost jewel
i held a jewel in my fingers
and went to sleep
the day was warm, and winds were prosy
i said t will keep
i woke and chid my honest fingers, --
the gem was gone
and now an amethyst remembrance
is all i own
xvi
what if i say i shall not wait?
what if i burst the fleshly gate
and pass, escaped, to thee?
what if i file this mortal off,
see where it hurt me, -- that s enough, --
and wade in liberty?
they cannot take us any more, --
dungeons may call, and guns implore
unmeaning now, to me,
as laughter was an hour ago,
or laces, or a travelling show,
or who died yesterday
iii nature
i
mother nature
nature, the gentlest mother,
impatient of no child,
the feeblest or the waywardest, --
her admonition mild
in forest and the hill
by traveller is heard,
restraining rampant squirrel
or too impetuous bird
how fair her conversation,
a summer afternoon, --
her household, her assembly
and when the sun goes down
her voice among the aisles
incites the timid prayer
of the minutest cricket,
the most unworthy flower
when all the children sleep
she turns as long away
as will suffice to light her lamps
then, bending from the sky
with infinite affection
and infiniter care,
her golden finger on her lip,
wills silence everywhere
ii
out of the morning
will there really be a morning?
is there such a thing as day?
could i see it from the mountains
if i were as tall as they?
has it feet like water-lilies?
has it feathers like a bird?
is it brought from famous countries
of which i have never heard?
oh, some scholar oh, some sailor
oh, some wise man from the skies
please to tell a little pilgrim
where the place called morning lies
iii
at half-past three a single bird
unto a silent sky
propounded but a single term
of cautious melody
at half-past four, experiment
had subjugated test,
and lo her silver principle
supplanted all the rest
at half-past seven, element
nor implement was seen,
and place was where the presence was,
circumference between
iv
days parlor
the day came slow, till five oclock,
then sprang before the hills
like hindered rubies, or the light
a sudden musket spills
the purple could not keep the east,
the sunrise shook from fold,
like breadths of topaz, packed a night,
the lady just unrolled
the happy winds their timbrels took
the birds, in docile rows,
arranged themselves around their prince
the wind is prince of those
the orchard sparkled like a jew, --
how mighty t was, to stay
a guest in this stupendous place,
the parlor of the day
v
the suns wooing
the sun just touched the morning
the morning, happy thing,
supposed that he had come to dwell,
and life would be all spring
she felt herself supremer, --
a raised, ethereal thing
henceforth for her what holiday
meanwhile, her wheeling king
trailed slow along the orchards
his haughty, spangled hems,
leaving a new necessity, --
the want of diadems
the morning fluttered, staggered,
felt feebly for her crown, --
her unanointed forehead
henceforth her only one
vi
the robin
the robin is the one
that interrupts the morn
with hurried, few, express reports
when march is scarcely on
the robin is the one
that overflows the noon
with her cherubic quantity,
an april but begun
the robin is the one
that speechless from her nest
submits that home and certainty
and sanctity are best
vii
the butterflys day
from cocoon forth a butterfly
as lady from her door
emerged -- a summer afternoon --
repairing everywhere,
without design, that i could trace,
except to stray abroad
on miscellaneous enterprise
the clovers understood
her pretty parasol was seen
contracting in a field
where men made hay, then struggling hard
with an opposing cloud,
where parties, phantom as herself,
to nowhere seemed to go
in purposeless circumference,
as t were a tropic show
and notwithstanding bee that worked,
and flower that zealous blew,
this audience of idleness
disdained them, from the sky,
till sundown crept, a steady tide,
and men that made the hay,
and afternoon, and butterfly,
extinguished in its sea
viii
the bluebird
before you thought of spring,
except as a surmise,
you see, god bless his suddenness,
a fellow in the skies
of independent hues,
a little weather-worn,
inspiriting habiliments
of indigo and brown
with specimens of song,
as if for you to choose,
discretion in the interval,
with gay delays he goes
to some superior tree
without a single leaf,
and shouts for joy to nobody
but his seraphic self
ix
april
an altered look about the hills
a tyrian light the village fills
a wider sunrise in the dawn
a deeper twilight on the lawn
a print of a vermilion foot
a purple finger on the slope
a flippant fly upon the pane
a spider at his trade again
an added strut in chanticleer
a flower expected everywhere
an axe shrill singing in the woods
fern-odors on untravelled roads, --
all this, and more i cannot tell,
a furtive look you know as well,
and nicodemus mystery
receives its annual reply
x
the sleeping flowers
whose are the little beds, i asked,
which in the valleys lie?
some shook their heads, and others smiled,
and no one made reply
perhaps they did not hear, i said
i will inquire again
whose are the beds, the tiny beds
so thick upon the plain?
t is daisy in the shortest
a little farther on,
nearest the door to wake the first,
little leontodon
t is iris, sir, and aster,
anemone and bell,
batschia in the blanket red,
and chubby daffodil
meanwhile at many cradles
her busy foot she plied,
humming the quaintest lullaby
that ever rocked a child
hush epigea wakens --
the crocus stirs her lids,
rhodoras cheek is crimson, --
shes dreaming of the woods
then, turning from them, reverent,
their bed-time t is, she said
the bumble-bees will wake them
when april woods are red
xi
my rose
pigmy seraphs gone astray,
velvet people from vevay,
belles from some lost summer day,
bees exclusive coterie
paris could not lay the fold
belted down with emerald
venice could not show a cheek
of a tint so lustrous meek
never such an ambuscade
as of brier and leaf displayed
for my little damask maid
i had rather wear her grace
than an earls distinguished face
i had rather dwell like her
than be duke of exeter
royalty enough for me
to subdue the bumble-bee
xii
the orioles secret
to hear an oriole sing
may be a common thing,
or only a divine
it is not of the bird
who sings the same, unheard,
as unto crowd
the fashion of the ear
attireth that it hear
in dun or fair
so whether it be rune,
or whether it be none,
is of within
the tune is in the tree,
the sceptic showeth me
no, sir in thee
xiii
the oriole
one of the ones that midas touched,
who failed to touch us all,
was that confiding prodigal,
the blissful oriole
so drunk, he disavows it
with badinage divine
so dazzling, we mistake him
for an alighting mine
a pleader, a dissembler,
an epicure, a thief, --
betimes an oratorio,
an ecstasy in chief
the jesuit of orchards,
he cheats as he enchants
of an entire attar
for his decamping wants
the splendor of a burmah,
the meteor of birds,
departing like a pageant
of ballads and of bards
i never thought that jason sought
for any golden fleece
but then i am a rural man,
with thoughts that make for peace
but if there were a jason,
tradition suffer me
behold his lost emolument
upon the apple-tree
xiv
in shadow
i dreaded that first robin so,
but he is mastered now,
and i m accustomed to him grown, --
he hurts a little, though
i thought if i could only live
till that first shout got by,
not all pianos in the woods
had power to mangle me
i dared not meet the daffodils,
for fear their yellow gown
would pierce me with a fashion
so foreign to my own
i wished the grass would hurry,
so when t was time to see,
he d be too tall, the tallest one
could stretch to look at me
i could not bear the bees should come,
i wished they d stay away
in those dim countries where they go
what word had they for me?
they re here, though not a creature failed,
no blossom stayed away
in gentle deference to me,
the queen of calvary
each one salutes me as he goes,
and i my childish plumes
lift, in bereaved acknowledgment
of their unthinking drums
xv
the humming-bird
a route of evanescence
with a revolving wheel
a resonance of emerald,
a rush of cochineal
and every blossom on the bush
adjusts its tumbled head, --
the mail from tunis, probably,
an easy mornings ride
xvi
secrets
the skies cant keep their secret
they tell it to the hills --
the hills just tell the orchards --
and they the daffodils
a bird, by chance, that goes that way
soft overheard the whole
if i should bribe the little bird,
who knows but she would tell?
i think i wont, however,
its finer not to know
if summer were an axiom,
what sorcery had snow?
so keep your secret, father
i would not, if i could,
know what the sapphire fellows do,
in your new-fashioned world
xvii
who robbed the woods,
the trusting woods?
the unsuspecting trees
brought out their burrs and mosses
his fantasy to please
he scanned their trinkets, curious,
he grasped, he bore away
what will the solemn hemlock,
what will the fir-tree say?
xviii
two voyagers
two butterflies went out at noon
and waltzed above a stream,
then stepped straight through the firmament
and rested on a beam
and then together bore away
upon a shining sea, --
though never yet, in any port,
their coming mentioned be
if spoken by the distant bird,
if met in ether sea
by frigate or by merchantman,
report was not to me
xix
by the sea
i started early, took my dog,
and visited the sea
the mermaids in the basement
came out to look at me,
and frigates in the upper floor
extended hempen hands,
presuming me to be a mouse
aground, upon the sands
but no man moved me till the tide
went past my simple shoe,
and past my apron and my belt,
and past my bodice too,
and made as he would eat me up
as wholly as a dew
upon a dandelions sleeve --
and then i started too
and he -- he followed close behind
i felt his silver heel
upon my ankle, -- then my shoes
would overflow with pearl
until we met the solid town,
no man he seemed to know
and bowing with a mighty look
at me, the sea withdrew
xx
old-fashioned
arcturus is his other name, --
id rather call him star
its so unkind of science
to go and interfere
i pull a flower from the woods, --
a monster with a glass
computes the stamens in a breath,
and has her in a class
whereas i took the butterfly
aforetime in my hat,
he sits erect in cabinets,
the clover-bells forgot
what once was heaven, is zenith now
where i proposed to go
when times brief masquerade was done,
is mapped, and charted too
what if the poles should frisk about
and stand upon their heads
i hope i m ready for the worst,
whatever prank betides
perhaps the kingdom of heaven s changed
i hope the children there
wont be new-fashioned when i come,
and laugh at me, and stare
i hope the father in the skies
will lift his little girl, --
old-fashioned, naughty, everything, --
over the stile of pearl
xxi
a tempest
an awful tempest mashed the air,
the clouds were gaunt and few
a black, as of a spectres cloak,
hid heaven and earth from view
the creatures chuckled on the roofs
and whistled in the air,
and shook their fists and gnashed their teeth
and swung their frenzied hair
the morning lit, the birds arose
the monsters faded eyes
turned slowly to his native coast,
and peace was paradise
xxii
the sea
an everywhere of silver,
with ropes of sand
to keep it from effacing
the track called land
xxiii
in the garden
a bird came down the walk
he did not know i saw
he bit an angle-worm in halves
and ate the fellow, raw
and then he drank a dew
from a convenient grass,
and then hopped sidewise to the wall
to let a beetle pass
he glanced with rapid eyes
that hurried all abroad, --
they looked like frightened beads, i thought
he stirred his velvet head
like one in danger cautious,
i offered him a crumb,
and he unrolled his feathers
and rowed him softer home
than oars divide the ocean,
too silver for a seam,
or butterflies, off banks of noon,
leap, plashless, as they swim
xxiv
the snake
a narrow fellow in the grass
occasionally rides
you may have met him, -- did you not,
his notice sudden is
the grass divides as with a comb,
a spotted shaft is seen
and then it closes at your feet
and opens further on
he likes a boggy acre,
a floor too cool for corn
yet when a child, and barefoot,
i more than once, at morn,
have passed, i thought, a whip-lash
unbraiding in the sun, --
when, stooping to secure it,
it wrinkled, and was gone
several of natures people
i know, and they know me
i feel for them a transport
of cordiality
but never met this fellow,
attended or alone,
without a tighter breathing,
and zero at the bone
xxv
the mushroom
the mushroom is the elf of plants,
at evening it is not
at morning in a truffled hut
it stops upon a spot
as if it tarried always
and yet its whole career
is shorter than a snakes delay,
and fleeter than a tare
t is vegetations juggler,
the germ of alibi
doth like a bubble antedate,
and like a bubble hie
i feel as if the grass were pleased
to have it intermit
the surreptitious scion
of summers circumspect
had nature any outcast face,
could she a son contemn,
had nature an iscariot,
that mushroom, -- it is him
xxvi
the storm
there came a wind like a bugle
it quivered through the grass,
and a green chill upon the heat
so ominous did pass
we barred the windows and the doors
as from an emerald ghost
the dooms electric moccason
that very instant passed
on a strange mob of panting trees,
and fences fled away,
and rivers where the houses ran
the living looked that day
the bell within the steeple wild
the flying tidings whirled
how much can come
and much can go,
and yet abide the world
xxvii
the spider
a spider sewed at night
without a light
upon an arc of white
if ruff it was of dame
or shroud of gnome,
himself, himself inform
of immortality
his strategy
was physiognomy
xxviii
i know a place where summer strives
with such a practised frost,
she each year leads her daisies back,
recording briefly, lost
but when the south wind stirs the pools
and struggles in the lanes,
her heart misgives her for her vow,
and she pours soft refrains
into the lap of adamant,
and spices, and the dew,
that stiffens quietly to quartz,
upon her amber shoe
xxix
the one that could repeat the summer day
were greater than itself, though he
minutest of mankind might be
and who could reproduce the sun,
at period of going down --
the lingering and the stain, i mean --
when orient has been outgrown,
and occident becomes unknown,
his name remain
xxx
the wlnds visit
the wind tapped like a tired man,
and like a host, come in,
i boldly answered entered then
my residence within
a rapid, footless guest,
to offer whom a chair
were as impossible as hand
a sofa to the air
no bone had he to bind him,
his speech was like the push
of numerous humming-birds at once
from a superior bush
his countenance a billow,
his fingers, if he pass,
let go a music, as of tunes
blown tremulous in glass
he visited, still flitting
then, like a timid man,
again he tapped -- t was flurriedly --
and i became alone
xxxi
nature rarer uses yellow
than another hue
saves she all of that for sunsets, --
prodigal of blue,
spending scarlet like a woman,
yellow she affords
only scantly and selectly,
like a lovers words
xxxii
gossip
the leaves, like women, interchange
sagacious confidence
somewhat of nods, and somewhat of
portentous inference,
the parties in both cases
enjoining secrecy, --
inviolable compact
to notoriety
xxxiii
simplicity
how happy is the little stone
that rambles in the road alone,
and doesnt care about careers,
and exigencies never fears
whose coat of elemental brown
a passing universe put on
and independent as the sun,
associates or glows alone,
fulfilling absolute decree
in casual simplicity
xxxiv
storm
it sounded as if the streets were running,
and then the streets stood still
eclipse was all we could see at the window,
and awe was all we could feel
by and by the boldest stole out of his covert,
to see if time was there
nature was in her beryl apron,
mixing fresher air
xxxv
the rat
the rat is the concisest tenant
he pays no rent, --
repudiates the obligation,
on schemes intent
balking our wit
to sound or circumvent,
hate cannot harm
a foe so reticent
neither decree
prohibits him,
lawful as
equilibrium
xxxvi
frequently the woods are pink,
frequently are brown
frequently the hills undress
behind my native town
oft a head is crested
i was wont to see,
and as oft a cranny
where it used to be
and the earth, they tell me,
on its axis turned, --
wonderful rotation
by but twelve performed
xxxvii
a thunder-storm
the wind begun to rock the grass
with threatening tunes and low, --
he flung a menace at the earth,
a menace at the sky
the leaves unhooked themselves from trees
and started all abroad
the dust did scoop itself like hands
and throw away the road
the wagons quickened on the streets,
the thunder hurried slow
the lightning showed a yellow beak,
and then a livid claw
the birds put up the bars to nests,
the cattle fled to barns
there came one drop of giant rain,
and then, as if the hands
that held the dams had parted hold,
the waters wrecked the sky,
but overlooked my fathers house,
just quartering a tree
xxxviii
with flowers
south winds jostle them,
bumblebees come,
hover, hesitate,
drink, and are gone
butterflies pause
on their passage cashmere
i, softly plucking,
present them here
xxxix
sunset
where ships of purple gently toss
on seas of daffodil,
fantastic sailors mingle,
and then -- the wharf is still
xl
she sweeps with many-colored brooms,
and leaves the shreds behind
oh, housewife in the evening west,
come back, and dust the pond
you dropped a purple ravelling in,
you dropped an amber thread
and now you ve littered all the east
with duds of emerald
and still she plies her spotted brooms,
and still the aprons fly,
till brooms fade softly into stars --
and then i come away
xli
like mighty footlights burned the red
at bases of the trees, --
the far theatricals of day
exhibiting to these
t was universe that did applaud
while, chiefest of the crowd,
enabled by his royal dress,
myself distinguished god
xlii
problems
bring me the sunset in a cup,
reckon the mornings flagons up,
and say how many dew
tell me how far the morning leaps,
tell me what time the weaver sleeps
who spun the breadths of blue
write me how many notes there be
in the new robins ecstasy
among astonished boughs
how many trips the tortoise makes,
how many cups the bee partakes, --
the debauchee of dews
also, who laid the rainbows piers,
also, who leads the docile spheres
by withes of supple blue?
whose fingers string the stalactite,
who counts the wampum of the night,
to see that none is due?
who built this little alban house
and shut the windows down so close
my spirit cannot see?
who ll let me out some gala day,
with implements to fly away,
passing pomposity?
xliii
the juggler of day
blazing in gold and quenching in purple,
leaping like leopards to the sky,
then at the feet of the old horizon
laying her spotted face, to die
stooping as low as the otters window,
touching the roof and tinting the barn,
kissing her bonnet to the meadow, --
and the juggler of day is gone
xliv
my cricket
farther in summer than the birds,
pathetic from the grass,
a minor nation celebrates
its unobtrusive mass
no ordinance is seen,
so gradual the grace,
a pensive custom it becomes,
enlarging loneliness
antiquest felt at noon
when august, burning low,
calls forth this spectral canticle,
repose to typify
remit as yet no grace,
no furrow on the glow,
yet a druidic difference
enhances nature now
xlv
as imperceptibly as grief
the summer lapsed away, --
too imperceptible, at last,
to seem like perfidy
a quietness distilled,
as twilight long begun,
or nature, spending with herself
sequestered afternoon
the dusk drew earlier in,
the morning foreign shone, --
a courteous, yet harrowing grace,
as guest who would be gone
and thus, without a wing,
or service of a keel,
our summer made her light escape
into the beautiful
xlvi
it cant be summer, -- that got through
it s early yet for spring
there s that long town of white to cross
before the blackbirds sing
it cant be dying, -- its too rouge, --
the dead shall go in white
so sunset shuts my question down
with clasps of chrysolite
xlvii
summers obsequies
the gentian weaves her fringes,
the maples loom is red
my departing blossoms
obviate parade
a brief, but patient illness,
an hour to prepare
and one, below this morning,
is where the angels are
it was a short procession, --
the bobolink was there,
an aged bee addressed us,
and then we knelt in prayer
we trust that she was willing, --
we ask that we may be
summer, sister, seraph,
let us go with thee
in the name of the bee
and of the butterfly
and of the breeze, amen
xlviii
fringed gentian
god made a little gentian
it tried to be a rose
and failed, and all the summer laughed
but just before the snows
there came a purple creature
that ravished all the hill
and summer hid her forehead,
and mockery was still
the frosts were her condition
the tyrian would not come
until the north evoked it
creator shall i bloom?
xlix
november
besides the autumn poets sing,
a few prosaic days
a little this side of the snow
and that side of the haze
a few incisive mornings,
a few ascetic eyes, --
gone mr bryants golden-rod,
and mr thomsons sheaves
still is the bustle in the brook,
sealed are the spicy valves
mesmeric fingers softly touch
the eyes of many elves
perhaps a squirrel may remain,
my sentiments to share
grant me, o lord, a sunny mind,
thy windy will to bear
l
the snow
it sifts from leaden sieves,
it powders all the wood,
it fills with alabaster wool
the wrinkles of the road
it makes an even face
of mountain and of plain, --
unbroken forehead from the east
unto the east again
it reaches to the fence,
it wraps it, rail by rail,
till it is lost in fleeces
it flings a crystal veil
on stump and stack and stem, --
the summers empty room,
acres of seams where harvests were,
recordless, but for them
it ruffles wrists of posts,
as ankles of a queen, --
then stills its artisans like ghosts,
denying they have been
li
the blue jay
no brigadier throughout the year
so civic as the jay
a neighbor and a warrior too,
with shrill felicity
pursuing winds that censure us
a february day,
the brother of the universe
was never blown away
the snow and he are intimate
i ve often seen them play
when heaven looked upon us all
with such severity,
i felt apology were due
to an insulted sky,
whose pompous frown was nutriment
to their temerity
the pillow of this daring head
is pungent evergreens
his larder -- terse and militant --
unknown, refreshing things
his character a tonic,
his future a dispute
unfair an immortality
that leaves this neighbor out
iv time and eternity
i
let down the bars, o death
the tired flocks come in
whose bleating ceases to repeat,
whose wandering is done
thine is the stillest night,
thine the securest fold
too near thou art for seeking thee,
too tender to be told
ii
going to heaven
i dont know when,
pray do not ask me how, --
indeed, i m too astonished
to think of answering you
going to heaven --
how dim it sounds
and yet it will be done
as sure as flocks go home at night
unto the shepherds arm
perhaps you re going too
who knows?
if you should get there first,
save just a little place for me
close to the two i lost
the smallest robe will fit me,
and just a bit of crown
for you know we do not mind our dress
when we are going home
i m glad i dont believe it,
for it would stop my breath,
and i d like to look a little more
at such a curious earth
i am glad they did believe it
whom i have never found
since the mighty autumn afternoon
i left them in the ground
iii
at least to pray is left, is left
o jesus in the air
i know not which thy chamber is, --
i m knocking everywhere
thou stirrest earthquake in the south,
and maelstrom in the sea
say, jesus christ of nazareth,
hast thou no arm for me?
iv
epitaph
step lightly on this narrow spot
the broadest land that grows
is not so ample as the breast
these emerald seams enclose
step lofty for this name is told
as far as cannon dwell,
or flag subsist, or fame export
her deathless syllable
v
morns like these we parted
noons like these she rose,
fluttering first, then firmer,
to her fair repose
never did she lisp it,
and t was not for me
she was mute from transport,
i, from agony
till the evening, nearing,
one the shutters drew --
quick a sharper rustling
and this linnet flew
vi
a death-blow is a life-blow to some
who, till they died, did not alive become
who, had they lived, had died, but when
they died, vitality begun
vii
i read my sentence steadily,
reviewed it with my eyes,
to see that i made no mistake
in its extremest clause, --
the date, and manner of the shame
and then the pious form
that god have mercy on the soul
the jury voted him
i made my soul familiar
with her extremity,
that at the last it should not be
a novel agony,
but she and death, acquainted,
meet tranquilly as friends,
salute and pass without a hint --
and there the matter ends
viii
i have not told my garden yet,
lest that should conquer me
i have not quite the strength now
to break it to the bee
i will not name it in the street,
for shops would stare, that i,
so shy, so very ignorant,
should have the face to die
the hillsides must not know it,
where i have rambled so,
nor tell the loving forests
the day that i shall go,
nor lisp it at the table,
nor heedless by the way
hint that within the riddle
one will walk to-day
ix
the battle-field
they dropped like flakes, they dropped like stars,
like petals from a rose,
when suddenly across the june
a wind with fingers goes
they perished in the seamless grass, --
no eye could find the place
but god on his repealless list
can summon every face
x
the only ghost i ever saw
was dressed in mechlin, -- so
he wore no sandal on his foot,
and stepped like flakes of snow
his gait was soundless, like the bird,
but rapid, like the roe
his fashions quaint, mosaic,
or, haply, mistletoe
his conversation seldom,
his laughter like the breeze
that dies away in dimples
among the pensive trees
our interview was transient,--
of me, himself was shy
and god forbid i look behind
since that appalling day
xi
some, too fragile for winter winds,
the thoughtful grave encloses, --
tenderly tucking them in from frost
before their feet are cold
never the treasures in her nest
the cautious grave exposes,
building where schoolboy dare not look
and sportsman is not bold
this covert have all the children
early aged, and often cold, --
sparrows unnoticed by the father
lambs for whom time had not a fold
xii
as by the dead we love to sit,
become so wondrous dear,
as for the lost we grapple,
though all the rest are here, --
in broken mathematics
we estimate our prize,
vast, in its fading ratio,
to our penurious eyes
xiii
memorials
death sets a thing significant
the eye had hurried by,
except a perished creature
entreat us tenderly
to ponder little workmanships
in crayon or in wool,
with this was last her fingers did,
industrious until
the thimble weighed too heavy,
the stitches stopped themselves,
and then t was put among the dust
upon the closet shelves
a book i have, a friend gave,
whose pencil, here and there,
had notched the place that pleased him, --
at rest his fingers are
now, when i read, i read not,
for interrupting tears
obliterate the etchings
too costly for repairs
xiv
i went to heaven, --
t was a small town,
lit with a ruby,
lathed with down
stiller than the fields
at the full dew,
beautiful as pictures
no man drew
people like the moth,
of mechlin, frames,
duties of gossamer,
and eider names
almost contented
i could be
mong such unique
society
xv
their height in heaven comforts not,
their glory nought to me
t was best imperfect, as it was
i m finite, i cant see
the house of supposition,
the glimmering frontier
that skirts the acres of perhaps,
to me shows insecure
the wealth i had contented me
if t was a meaner size,
then i had counted it until
it pleased my narrow eyes
better than larger values,
however true their show
this timid life of evidence
keeps pleading, i dont know
xvi
there is a shame of nobleness
confronting sudden pelf, --
a finer shame of ecstasy
convicted of itself
a best disgrace a brave man feels,
acknowledged of the brave, --
one more ye blessed to be told
but this involves the grave
xvii
triumph
triumph may be of several kinds
there s triumph in the room
when that old imperator, death,
by faith is overcome
there s triumph of the finer mind
when truth, affronted long,
advances calm to her supreme,
her god her only throng
a triumph when temptations bribe
is slowly handed back,
one eye upon the heaven renounced
and one upon the rack
severer triumph, by himself
experienced, who can pass
acquitted from that naked bar,
jehovahs countenance
xviii
pompless no life can pass away
the lowliest career
to the same pageant wends its way
as that exalted here
how cordial is the mystery
the hospitable pall
a this way beckons spaciously, --
a miracle for all
xix
i noticed people disappeared,
when but a little child, --
supposed they visited remote,
or settled regions wild
now know i they both visited
and settled regions wild,
but did because they died, -- a fact
withheld the little child
xx
following
i had no cause to be awake,
my best was gone to sleep,
and morn a new politeness took,
and failed to wake them up,
but called the others clear,
and passed their curtains by
sweet morning, when i over-sleep,
knock, recollect, for me
i looked at sunrise once,
and then i looked at them,
and wishfulness in me arose
for circumstance the same
t was such an ample peace,
it could not hold a sigh, --
t was sabbath with the bells divorced,
t was sunset all the day
so choosing but a gown
and taking but a prayer,
the only raiment i should need,
i struggled, and was there
xxi
if anybodys friend be dead,
it s sharpest of the theme
the thinking how they walked alive,
at such and such a time
their costume, of a sunday,
some manner of the hair, --
a prank nobody knew but them,
lost, in the sepulchre
how warm they were on such a day
you almost feel the date,
so short way off it seems and now,
they re centuries from that
how pleased they were at what you said
you try to touch the smile,
and dip your fingers in the frost
when was it, can you tell,
you asked the company to tea,
acquaintance, just a few,
and chatted close with this grand thing
that dont remember you?
past bows and invitations,
past interview, and vow,
past what ourselves can estimate, --
that makes the quick of woe
xxii
the journey
our journey had advanced
our feet were almost come
to that odd fork in beings road,
eternity by term
our pace took sudden awe,
our feet reluctant led
before were cities, but between,
the forest of the dead
retreat was out of hope, --
behind, a sealed route,
eternitys white flag before,
and god at every gate
xxiii
a country burial
ample make this bed
make this bed with awe
in it wait till judgment break
excellent and fair
be its mattress straight,
be its pillow round
let no sunrise yellow noise
interrupt this ground
xxiv
going
on such a night, or such a night,
would anybody care
if such a little figure
slipped quiet from its chair,
so quiet, oh, how quiet
that nobody might know
but that the little figure
rocked softer, to and fro?
on such a dawn, or such a dawn,
would anybody sigh
that such a little figure
too sound asleep did lie
for chanticleer to wake it, --
or stirring house below,
or giddy bird in orchard,
or early task to do?
there was a little figure plump
for every little knoll,
busy needles, and spools of thread,
and trudging feet from school
playmates, and holidays, and nuts,
and visions vast and small
strange that the feet so precious charged
should reach so small a goal
xxv
essential oils are wrung
the attar from the rose
is not expressed by suns alone,
it is the gift of screws
the general rose decays
but this, in ladys drawer,
makes summer when the lady lies
in ceaseless rosemary
xxvi
i lived on dread to those who know
the stimulus there is
in danger, other impetus
is numb and vital-less
as t were a spur upon the soul,
a fear will urge it where
to go without the spectres aid
were challenging despair
xxvii
if i should die,
and you should live,
and time should gurgle on,
and morn should beam,
and noon should burn,
as it has usual done
if birds should build as early,
and bees as bustling go, --
one might depart at option
from enterprise below
t is sweet to know that stocks will stand
when we with daisies lie,
that commerce will continue,
and trades as briskly fly
it makes the parting tranquil
and keeps the soul serene,
that gentlemen so sprightly
conduct the pleasing scene
xxviii
at length
her final summer was it,
and yet we guessed it not
if tenderer industriousness
pervaded her, we thought
a further force of life
developed from within, --
when death lit all the shortness up,
and made the hurry plain
we wondered at our blindness, --
when nothing was to see
but her carrara guide-post, --
at our stupidity,
when, duller than our dulness,
the busy darling lay,
so busy was she, finishing,
so leisurely were we
xxix
ghosts
one need not be a chamber to be haunted,
one need not be a house
the brain has corridors surpassing
material place
far safer, of a midnight meeting
external ghost,
than an interior confronting
that whiter host
far safer through an abbey gallop,
the stones achase,
than, moonless, ones own self encounter
in lonesome place
ourself, behind ourself concealed,
should startle most
assassin, hid in our apartment,
be horrors least
the prudent carries a revolver,
he bolts the door,
oerlooking a superior spectre
more near
xxx
vanished
she died, -- this was the way she died
and when her breath was done,
took up her simple wardrobe
and started for the sun
her little figure at the gate
the angels must have spied,
since i could never find her
upon the mortal side
xxxi
precedence
wait till the majesty of death
invests so mean a brow
almost a powdered footman
might dare to touch it now
wait till in everlasting robes
this democrat is dressed,
then prate about preferment
and station and the rest
around this quiet courtier
obsequious angels wait
full royal is his retinue,
full purple is his state
a lord might dare to lift the hat
to such a modest clay,
since that my lord, the lord of lords
receives unblushingly
xxxii
gone
went up a year this evening
i recollect it well
amid no bells nor bravos
the bystanders will tell
cheerful, as to the village,
tranquil, as to repose,
chastened, as to the chapel,
this humble tourist rose
did not talk of returning,
alluded to no time
when, were the gales propitious,
we might look for him
was grateful for the roses
in lifes diverse bouquet,
talked softly of new species
to pick another day
beguiling thus the wonder,
the wondrous nearer drew
hands bustled at the moorings --
the crowd respectful grew
ascended from our vision
to countenances new
a difference, a daisy,
is all the rest i knew
xxxiii
requiem
taken from men this morning,
carried by men to-day,
met by the gods with banners
who marshalled her away
one little maid from playmates,
one little mind from school, --
there must be guests in eden
all the rooms are full
far as the east from even,
dim as the border star, --
courtiers quaint, in kingdoms,
our departed are
xxxiv
what inn is this
where for the night
peculiar traveller comes?
who is the landlord?
where the maids?
behold, what curious rooms
no ruddy fires on the hearth,
no brimming tankards flow
necromancer, landlord,
who are these below?
xxxv
it was not death, for i stood up,
and all the dead lie down
it was not night, for all the bells
put out their tongues, for noon
it was not frost, for on my flesh
i felt siroccos crawl, --
nor fire, for just my marble feet
could keep a chancel cool
and yet it tasted like them all
the figures i have seen
set orderly, for burial,
reminded me of mine,
as if my life were shaven
and fitted to a frame,
and could not breathe without a key
and t was like midnight, some,
when everything that ticked has stopped,
and space stares, all around,
or grisly frosts, first autumn morns,
repeal the beating ground
but most like chaos, -- stopless, cool, --
without a chance or spar,
or even a report of land
to justify despair
xxxvi
till the end
i should not dare to leave my friend,
because -- because if he should die
while i was gone, and i -- too late --
should reach the heart that wanted me
if i should disappoint the eyes
that hunted, hunted so, to see,
and could not bear to shut until
they noticed me -- they noticed me
if i should stab the patient faith
so sure i d come -- so sure i d come,
it listening, listening, went to sleep
telling my tardy name, --
my heart would wish it broke before,
since breaking then, since breaking then,
were useless as next mornings sun,
where midnight frosts had lain
xxxvii
void
great streets of silence led away
to neighborhoods of pause
here was no notice, no dissent,
no universe, no laws
by clocks t was morning, and for night
the bells at distance called
but epoch had no basis here,
for period exhaled
xxxviii
a throe upon the features
a hurry in the breath,
an ecstasy of parting
denominated death, --
an anguish at the mention,
which, when to patience grown,
i ve known permission given
to rejoin its own
xxxix
saved
of tribulation these are they
denoted by the white
the spangled gowns, a lesser rank
of victors designate
all these did conquer but the ones
who overcame most times
wear nothing commoner than snow,
no ornament but palms
surrender is a sort unknown
on this superior soil
defeat, an outgrown anguish,
remembered as the mile
our panting ankle barely gained
when night devoured the road
but we stood whispering in the house,
and all we said was saved
xl
i think just how my shape will rise
when i shall be forgiven,
till hair and eyes and timid head
are out of sight, in heaven
i think just how my lips will weigh
with shapeless, quivering prayer
that you, so late, consider me,
the sparrow of your care
i mind me that of anguish sent,
some drifts were moved away
before my simple bosom broke, --
and why not this, if they?
and so, until delirious borne
i con that thing, -- forgiven, --
till with long fright and longer trust
i drop my heart, unshriven
xli
the forgotten grave
after a hundred years
nobody knows the place, --
agony, that enacted there,
motionless as peace
weeds triumphant ranged,
strangers strolled and spelled
at the lone orthography
of the elder dead
winds of summer fields
recollect the way, --
instinct picking up the key
dropped by memory
xlii
lay this laurel on the one
too intrinsic for renown
laurel veil your deathless tree, --
him you chasten, that is he
poems
by emily dickinson
third series
edited by
mabel loomis todd
its all i have to bring to-day,
this, and my heart beside,
this, and my heart, and all the fields,
and all the meadows wide
be sure you count, should i forget, --
some one the sum could tell, --
this, and my heart, and all the bees
which in the clover dwell
preface
the intellectual activity of emily dickinson was so great that
a large and characteristic choice is still possible among her
literary material, and this third volume of her verses is put
forth in response to the repeated wish of the admirers of her
peculiar genius much of emily dickinsons prose was rhythmic,
--even rhymed, though frequently not set apart in lines
also many verses, written as such, were sent to friends in
letters these were published in , in the volumes of her
letters it has not been necessary, however, to include them in
this series, and all have been omitted, except three or four
exceptionally strong ones, as a book, and with flowers
there is internal evidence that many of the poems were simply
spontaneous flashes of insight, apparently unrelated to outward
circumstance others, however, had an obvious personal origin
for example, the verses i had a guinea golden, which seem to
have been sent to some friend travelling in europe, as a dainty
reminder of letter-writing delinquencies the surroundings in
which any of emily dickinsons verses are known to have been
written usually serve to explain them clearly but in general the
present volume is full of thoughts needing no interpretation to
those who apprehend this scintillating spirit
m l t
amherst, october,
i life
i
real riches
t is little i could care for pearls
who own the ample sea
or brooches, when the emperor
with rubies pelteth me
or gold, who am the prince of mines
or diamonds, when i see
a diadem to fit a dome
continual crowning me
ii
superiority to fate
superiority to fate
is difficult to learn
t is not conferred by any,
but possible to earn
a pittance at a time,
until, to her surprise,
the soul with strict economy
subsists till paradise
iii
hope
hope is a subtle glutton
he feeds upon the fair
and yet, inspected closely,
what abstinence is there
his is the halcyon table
that never seats but one,
and whatsoever is consumed
the same amounts remain
iv
forbidden fruit
i
forbidden fruit a flavor has
that lawful orchards mocks
how luscious lies the pea within
the pod that duty locks
v
forbidden fruit
ii
heaven is what i cannot reach
the apple on the tree,
provided it do hopeless hang,
that heaven is, to me
the color on the cruising cloud,
the interdicted ground
behind the hill, the house behind, --
there paradise is found
vi
a word
a word is dead
when it is said,
some say
i say it just
begins to live
that day
vii
to venerate the simple days
which lead the seasons by,
needs but to remember
that from you or me
they may take the trifle
termed mortality
to invest existence with a stately air,
needs but to remember
that the acorn there
is the egg of forests
for the upper air
viii
lifes trades
its such a little thing to weep,
so short a thing to sigh
and yet by trades the size of these
we men and women die
ix
drowning is not so pitiful
as the attempt to rise
three times, t is said, a sinking man
comes up to face the skies,
and then declines forever
to that abhorred abode
where hope and he part company, --
for he is grasped of god
the makers cordial visage,
however good to see,
is shunned, we must admit it,
like an adversity
x
how still the bells in steeples stand,
till, swollen with the sky,
they leap upon their silver feet
in frantic melody
xi
if the foolish call them flowers,
need the wiser tell?
if the savans classify them,
it is just as well
those who read the revelations
must not criticise
those who read the same edition
with beclouded eyes
could we stand with that old moses
canaan denied, --
scan, like him, the stately landscape
on the other side, --
doubtless we should deem superfluous
many sciences
not pursued by learned angels
in scholastic skies
low amid that glad belles lettres
grant that we may stand,
stars, amid profound galaxies,
at that grand right hand
xii
a syllable
could mortal lip divine
the undeveloped freight
of a delivered syllable,
t would crumble with the weight
xiii
parting
my life closed twice before its close
it yet remains to see
if immortality unveil
a third event to me,
so huge, so hopeless to conceive,
as these that twice befell
parting is all we know of heaven,
and all we need of hell
xiv
aspiration
we never know how high we are
till we are called to rise
and then, if we are true to plan,
our statures touch the skies
the heroism we recite
would be a daily thing,
did not ourselves the cubits warp
for fear to be a king
xv
the inevitable
while i was fearing it, it came,
but came with less of fear,
because that fearing it so long
had almost made it dear
there is a fitting a dismay,
a fitting a despair
tis harder knowing it is due,
than knowing it is here
the trying on the utmost,
the morning it is new,
is terribler than wearing it
a whole existence through
xvi
a book
there is no frigate like a book
to take us lands away,
nor any coursers like a page
of prancing poetry
this traverse may the poorest take
without oppress of toll
how frugal is the chariot
that bears a human soul
xvii
who has not found the heaven below
will fail of it above
gods residence is next to mine,
his furniture is love
xviii
a portrait
a face devoid of love or grace,
a hateful, hard, successful face,
a face with which a stone
would feel as thoroughly at ease
as were they old acquaintances, --
first time together thrown
xix
i had a guinea golden
i had a guinea golden
i lost it in the sand,
and though the sum was simple,
and pounds were in the land,
still had it such a value
unto my frugal eye,
that when i could not find it
i sat me down to sigh
i had a crimson robin
who sang full many a day,
but when the woods were painted
he, too, did fly away
time brought me other robins, --
their ballads were the same, --
still for my missing troubadour
i kept the house at hame
i had a star in heaven
one pleiad was its name,
and when i was not heeding
it wandered from the same
and though the skies are crowded,
and all the night ashine,
i do not care about it,
since none of them are mine
my story has a moral
i have a missing friend, --
pleiad its name, and robin,
and guinea in the sand, --
and when this mournful ditty,
accompanied with tear,
shall meet the eye of traitor
in country far from here,
grant that repentance solemn
may seize upon his mind,
and he no consolation
beneath the sun may find
xx
saturday afternoon
from all the jails the boys and girls
ecstatically leap, --
beloved, only afternoon
that prison doesnt keep
they storm the earth and stun the air,
a mob of solid bliss
alas that frowns could lie in wait
for such a foe as this
xxi
few get enough, -- enough is one
to that ethereal throng
have not each one of us the right
to stealthily belong?
xxii
upon the gallows hung a wretch,
too sullied for the hell
to which the law entitled him
as natures curtain fell
the one who bore him tottered in,
for this was womans son
t was all i had, she stricken gasped
oh, what a livid boon
xxiii
the lost thought
i felt a clearing in my mind
as if my brain had split
i tried to match it, seam by seam,
but could not make them fit
the thought behind i strove to join
unto the thought before,
but sequence ravelled out of reach
like balls upon a floor
xxiv
reticence
the reticent volcano keeps
his never slumbering plan
confided are his projects pink
to no precarious man
if nature will not tell the tale
jehovah told to her,
can human nature not survive
without a listener?
admonished by her buckled lips
let every babbler be
the only secret people keep
is immortality
xxv
with flowers
if recollecting were forgetting,
then i remember not
and if forgetting, recollecting,
how near i had forgot
and if to miss were merry,
and if to mourn were gay,
how very blithe the fingers
that gathered these to-day
xxvi
the farthest thunder that i heard
was nearer than the sky,
and rumbles still, though torrid noons
have lain their missiles by
the lightning that preceded it
struck no one but myself,
but i would not exchange the bolt
for all the rest of life
indebtedness to oxygen
the chemist may repay,
but not the obligation
to electricity
it founds the homes and decks the days,
and every clamor bright
is but the gleam concomitant
of that waylaying light
the thought is quiet as a flake, --
a crash without a sound
how lifes reverberation
its explanation found
xxvii
on the bleakness of my lot
bloom i strove to raise
late, my acre of a rock
yielded grape and maize
soil of flint if steadfast tilled
will reward the hand
seed of palm by lybian sun
fructified in sand
xxviii
contrast
a door just opened on a street --
i, lost, was passing by --
an instants width of warmth disclosed,
and wealth, and company
the door as sudden shut, and i,
i, lost, was passing by, --
lost doubly, but by contrast most,
enlightening misery
xxix
friends
are friends delight or pain?
could bounty but remain
riches were good
but if they only stay
bolder to fly away,
riches are sad
xxx
fire
ashes denote that fire was
respect the grayest pile
for the departed creatures sake
that hovered there awhile
fire exists the first in light,
and then consolidates, --
only the chemist can disclose
into what carbonates
xxxi
a man
fate slew him, but he did not drop
she felled -- he did not fall --
impaled him on her fiercest stakes --
he neutralized them all
she stung him, sapped his firm advance,
but, when her worst was done,
and he, unmoved, regarded her,
acknowledged him a man
xxxii
ventures
finite to fail, but infinite to venture
for the one ship that struts the shore
manys the gallant, overwhelmed creature
nodding in navies nevermore
xxxiii
griefs
i measure every grief i meet
with analytic eyes
i wonder if it weighs like mine,
or has an easier size
i wonder if they bore it long,
or did it just begin?
i could not tell the date of mine,
it feels so old a pain
i wonder if it hurts to live,
and if they have to try,
and whether, could they choose between,
they would not rather die
i wonder if when years have piled --
some thousands -- on the cause
of early hurt, if such a lapse
could give them any pause
or would they go on aching still
through centuries above,
enlightened to a larger pain
by contrast with the love
the grieved are many, i am told
the reason deeper lies, --
death is but one and comes but once,
and only nails the eyes
theres grief of want, and grief of cold, --
a sort they call despair
theres banishment from native eyes,
in sight of native air
and though i may not guess the kind
correctly, yet to me
a piercing comfort it affords
in passing calvary,
to note the fashions of the cross,
of those that stand alone,
still fascinated to presume
that some are like my own
xxxiv
i have a king who does not speak
so, wondering, thro the hours meek
i trudge the day away,--
half glad when it is night and sleep,
if, haply, thro a dream to peep
in parlors shut by day
and if i do, when morning comes,
it is as if a hundred drums
did round my pillow roll,
and shouts fill all my childish sky,
and bells keep saying victory
from steeples in my soul
and if i dont, the little bird
within the orchard is not heard,
and i omit to pray,
father, thy will be done to-day,
for my will goes the other way,
and it were perjury
xxxv
disenchantment
it dropped so low in my regard
i heard it hit the ground,
and go to pieces on the stones
at bottom of my mind
yet blamed the fate that fractured, less
than i reviled myself
for entertaining plated wares
upon my silver shelf
xxxvi
lost faith
to lose ones faith surpasses
the loss of an estate,
because estates can be
replenished, -- faith cannot
inherited with life,
belief but once can be
annihilate a single clause,
and beings beggary
xxxvii
lost joy
i had a daily bliss
i half indifferent viewed,
till sudden i perceived it stir, --
it grew as i pursued,
till when, around a crag,
it wasted from my sight,
enlarged beyond my utmost scope,
i learned its sweetness right
xxxviii
i worked for chaff, and earning wheat
was haughty and betrayed
what right had fields to arbitrate
in matters ratified?
i tasted wheat, -- and hated chaff,
and thanked the ample friend
wisdom is more becoming viewed
at distance than at hand
xxxix
life, and death, and giants
such as these, are still
minor apparatus, hopper of the mill,
beetle at the candle,
or a fifes small fame,
maintain by accident
that they proclaim
xl
alpine glow
our lives are swiss, --
so still, so cool,
till, some odd afternoon,
the alps neglect their curtains,
and we look farther on
italy stands the other side,
while, like a guard between,
the solemn alps,
the siren alps,
forever intervene
xli
remembrance
remembrance has a rear and front, --
t is something like a house
it has a garret also
for refuse and the mouse,
besides, the deepest cellar
that ever mason hewed
look to it, by its fathoms
ourselves be not pursued
xlii
to hang our head ostensibly,
and subsequent to find
that such was not the posture
of our immortal mind,
affords the sly presumption
that, in so dense a fuzz,
you, too, take cobweb attitudes
upon a plane of gauze
xliii
the brain
the brain is wider than the sky,
for, put them side by side,
the one the other will include
with ease, and you beside
the brain is deeper than the sea,
for, hold them, blue to blue,
the one the other will absorb,
as sponges, buckets do
the brain is just the weight of god,
for, lift them, pound for pound,
and they will differ, if they do,
as syllable from sound
xliv
the bone that has no marrow
what ultimate for that?
it is not fit for table,
for beggar, or for cat
a bone has obligations,
a being has the same
a marrowless assembly
is culpabler than shame
but how shall finished creatures
a function fresh obtain? --
old nicodemus phantom
confronting us again
xlv
the past
the past is such a curious creature,
to look her in the face
a transport may reward us,
or a disgrace
unarmed if any meet her,
i charge him, fly
her rusty ammunition
might yet reply
xlvi
to help our bleaker parts
salubrious hours are given,
which if they do not fit for earth
drill silently for heaven
xlvii
what soft, cherubic creatures
these gentlewomen are
one would as soon assault a plush
or violate a star
such dimity convictions,
a horror so refined
of freckled human nature,
of deity ashamed, --
its such a common glory,
a fishermans degree
redemption, brittle lady,
be so, ashamed of thee
xlviii
desire
who never wanted, -- maddest joy
remains to him unknown
the banquet of abstemiousness
surpasses that of wine
within its hope, though yet ungrasped
desires perfect goal,
no nearer, lest reality
should disenthrall thy soul
xlix
philosophy
it might be easier
to fail with land in sight,
than gain my blue peninsula
to perish of delight
l
power
you cannot put a fire out
a thing that can ignite
can go, itself, without a fan
upon the slowest night
you cannot fold a flood
and put it in a drawer, --
because the winds would find it out,
and tell your cedar floor
li
a modest lot, a fame petite,
a brief campaign of sting and sweet
is plenty is enough
a sailors business is the shore,
a soldiers -- balls who asketh more
must seek the neighboring life
lii
is bliss, then, such abyss
i must not put my foot amiss
for fear i spoil my shoe?
id rather suit my foot
than save my boot,
for yet to buy another pair
is possible
at any fair
but bliss is sold just once
the patent lost
none buy it any more
liii
experience
i stepped from plank to plank
so slow and cautiously
the stars about my head i felt,
about my feet the sea
i knew not but the next
would be my final inch, --
this gave me that precarious gait
some call experience
liv
thanksgiving day
one day is there of the series
termed thanksgiving day,
celebrated part at table,
part in memory
neither patriarch nor pussy,
i dissect the play
seems it, to my hooded thinking,
reflex holiday
had there been no sharp subtraction
from the early sum,
not an acre or a caption
where was once a room,
not a mention, whose small pebble
wrinkled any bay, --
unto such, were such assembly,
t were thanksgiving day
lv
childish griefs
softened by times consummate plush,
how sleek the woe appears
that threatened childhoods citadel
and undermined the years
bisected now by bleaker griefs,
we envy the despair
that devastated childhoods realm,
so easy to repair
ii love
i
consecration
proud of my broken heart since thou didst break it,
proud of the pain i did not feel till thee,
proud of my night since thou with moons dost slake it,
not to partake thy passion, my humility
ii
loves humility
my worthiness is all my doubt,
his merit all my fear,
contrasting which, my qualities
do lowlier appear
lest i should insufficient prove
for his beloved need,
the chiefest apprehension
within my loving creed
so i, the undivine abode
of his elect content,
conform my soul as t were a church
unto her sacrament
iii
love
love is anterior to life,
posterior to death,
initial of creation, and
the exponent of breath
iv
satisfied
one blessing had i, than the rest
so larger to my eyes
that i stopped gauging, satisfied,
for this enchanted size
it was the limit of my dream,
the focus of my prayer, --
a perfect, paralyzing bliss
contented as despair
i knew no more of want or cold,
phantasms both become,
for this new value in the soul,
supremest earthly sum
the heaven below the heaven above
obscured with ruddier hue
lifes latitude leant over-full
the judgment perished, too
why joys so scantily disburse,
why paradise defer,
why floods are served to us in bowls, --
i speculate no more
v
with a flower
when roses cease to bloom, dear,
and violets are done,
when bumble-bees in solemn flight
have passed beyond the sun,
the hand that paused to gather
upon this summers day
will idle lie, in auburn, --
then take my flower, pray
vi
song
summer for thee grant i may be
when summer days are flown
thy music still when whippoorwill
and oriole are done
for thee to bloom, ill skip the tomb
and sow my blossoms oer
pray gather me, anemone,
thy flower forevermore
vii
loyalty
split the lark and youll find the music,
bulb after bulb, in silver rolled,
scantily dealt to the summer morning,
saved for your ear when lutes be old
loose the flood, you shall find it patent,
gush after gush, reserved for you
scarlet experiment sceptic thomas,
now, do you doubt that your bird was true?
viii
to lose thee, sweeter than to gain
all other hearts i knew
t is true the drought is destitute,
but then i had the dew
the caspian has its realms of sand,
its other realm of sea
without the sterile perquisite
no caspian could be
ix
poor little heart
did they forget thee?
then dinna care then dinna care
proud little heart
did they forsake thee?
be debonair be debonair
frail little heart
i would not break thee
couldst credit me? couldst credit me?
gay little heart
like morning glory
thoull wilted be thoull wilted be
x
forgotten
there is a word
which bears a sword
can pierce an armed man
it hurls its barbed syllables,--
at once is mute again
but where it fell
the saved will tell
on patriotic day,
some epauletted brother
gave his breath away
wherever runs the breathless sun,
wherever roams the day,
there is its noiseless onset,
there is its victory
behold the keenest marksman
the most accomplished shot
times sublimest target
is a soul forgot
xi
ive got an arrow here
loving the hand that sent it,
i the dart revere
fell, they will say, in skirmish
vanquished, my soul will know,
by but a simple arrow
sped by an archers bow
xii
the master
he fumbles at your spirit
as players at the keys
before they drop full music on
he stuns you by degrees,
prepares your brittle substance
for the ethereal blow,
by fainter hammers, further heard,
then nearer, then so slow
your breath has time to straighten,
your brain to bubble cool, --
deals one imperial thunderbolt
that scalps your naked soul
xiii
heart, we will forget him
you and i, to-night
you may forget the warmth he gave,
i will forget the light
when you have done, pray tell me,
that i my thoughts may dim
haste lest while youre lagging,
i may remember him
xiv
father, i bring thee not myself, --
that were the little load
i bring thee the imperial heart
i had not strength to hold
the heart i cherished in my own
till mine too heavy grew,
yet strangest, heavier since it went,
is it too large for you?
xv
we outgrow love like other things
and put it in the drawer,
till it an antique fashion shows
like costumes grandsires wore
xvi
not with a club the heart is broken,
nor with a stone
a whip, so small you could not see it
ive known
to lash the magic creature
till it fell,
yet that whips name too noble
then to tell
magnanimous of bird
by boy descried,
to sing unto the stone
of which it died
xvii
who?
my friend must be a bird,
because it flies
mortal my friend must be,
because it dies
barbs has it, like a bee
ah, curious friend,
thou puzzlest me
xviii
he touched me, so i live to know
that such a day, permitted so,
i groped upon his breast
it was a boundless place to me,
and silenced, as the awful sea
puts minor streams to rest
and now, im different from before,
as if i breathed superior air,
or brushed a royal gown
my feet, too, that had wandered so,
my gypsy face transfigured now
to tenderer renown
xix
dreams
let me not mar that perfect dream
by an auroral stain,
but so adjust my daily night
that it will come again
xx
numen lumen
i live with him, i see his face
i go no more away
for visitor, or sundown
deaths single privacy,
the only one forestalling mine,
and that by right that he
presents a claim invisible,
no wedlock granted me
i live with him, i hear his voice,
i stand alive to-day
to witness to the certainty
of immortality
taught me by time, -- the lower way,
conviction every day, --
that life like this is endless,
be judgment what it may
xxi
longing
i envy seas whereon he rides,
i envy spokes of wheels
of chariots that him convey,
i envy speechless hills
that gaze upon his journey
how easy all can see
what is forbidden utterly
as heaven, unto me
i envy nests of sparrows
that dot his distant eaves,
the wealthy fly upon his pane,
the happy, happy leaves
that just abroad his window
have summers leave to be,
the earrings of pizarro
could not obtain for me
i envy light that wakes him,
and bells that boldly ring
to tell him it is noon abroad, --
myself his noon could bring,
yet interdict my blossom
and abrogate my bee,
lest noon in everlasting night
drop gabriel and me
xxii
wedded
a solemn thing it was, i said,
a woman white to be,
and wear, if god should count me fit,
her hallowed mystery
a timid thing to drop a life
into the purple well,
too plummetless that it come back
eternity until
iii nature
i
natures changes
the springtimes pallid landscape
will glow like bright bouquet,
though drifted deep in parian
the village lies to-day
the lilacs, bending many a year,
with purple load will hang
the bees will not forget the tune
their old forefathers sang
the rose will redden in the bog,
the aster on the hill
her everlasting fashion set,
and covenant gentians frill,
till summer folds her miracle
as women do their gown,
or priests adjust the symbols
when sacrament is done
ii
the tulip
she slept beneath a tree
remembered but by me
i touched her cradle mute
she recognized the foot,
put on her carmine suit, --
and see
iii
a light exists in spring
not present on the year
at any other period
when march is scarcely here
a color stands abroad
on solitary hills
that science cannot overtake,
but human nature feels
it waits upon the lawn
it shows the furthest tree
upon the furthest slope we know
it almost speaks to me
then, as horizons step,
or noons report away,
without the formula of sound,
it passes, and we stay
a quality of loss
affecting our content,
as trade had suddenly encroached
upon a sacrament
iv
the waking year
a lady red upon the hill
her annual secret keeps
a lady white within the field
in placid lily sleeps
the tidy breezes with their brooms
sweep vale, and hill, and tree
prithee, my pretty housewives
who may expected be?
the neighbors do not yet suspect
the woods exchange a smile --
orchard, and buttercup, and bird --
in such a little while
and yet how still the landscape stands,
how nonchalant the wood,
as if the resurrection
were nothing very odd
v
to march
dear march, come in
how glad i am
i looked for you before
put down your hat --
you must have walked --
how out of breath you are
dear march, how are you?
and the rest?
did you leave nature well?
oh, march, come right upstairs with me,
i have so much to tell
i got your letter, and the birds
the maples never knew
that you were coming, -- i declare,
how red their faces grew
but, march, forgive me --
and all those hills
you left for me to hue
there was no purple suitable,
you took it all with you
who knocks? that april
lock the door
i will not be pursued
he stayed away a year, to call
when i am occupied
but trifles look so trivial
as soon as you have come,
that blame is just as dear as praise
and praise as mere as blame
vi
march
we like march, his shoes are purple,
he is new and high
makes he mud for dog and peddler,
makes he forest dry
knows the adders tongue his coming,
and begets her spot
stands the sun so close and mighty
that our minds are hot
news is he of all the others
bold it were to die
with the blue-birds buccaneering
on his british sky
vii
dawn
not knowing when the dawn will come
i open every door
or has it feathers like a bird,
or billows like a shore?
viii
a murmur in the trees to note,
not loud enough for wind
a star not far enough to seek,
nor near enough to find
a long, long yellow on the lawn,
a hubbub as of feet
not audible, as ours to us,
but dapperer, more sweet
a hurrying home of little men
to houses unperceived, --
all this, and more, if i should tell,
would never be believed
of robins in the trundle bed
how many i espy
whose nightgowns could not hide the wings,
although i heard them try
but then i promised neer to tell
how could i break my word?
so go your way and ill go mine, --
no fear youll miss the road
ix
morning is the place for dew,
corn is made at noon,
after dinner light for flowers,
dukes for setting sun
x
to my quick ear the leaves conferred
the bushes they were bells
i could not find a privacy
from natures sentinels
in cave if i presumed to hide,
the walls began to tell
creation seemed a mighty crack
to make me visible
xi
a rose
a sepal, petal, and a thorn
upon a common summers morn,
a flash of dew, a bee or two,
a breeze
a caper in the trees, --
and im a rose
xii
high from the earth i heard a bird
he trod upon the trees
as he esteemed them trifles,
and then he spied a breeze,
and situated softly
upon a pile of wind
which in a perturbation
nature had left behind
a joyous-going fellow
i gathered from his talk,
which both of benediction
and badinage partook,
without apparent burden,
i learned, in leafy wood
he was the faithful father
of a dependent brood
and this untoward transport
his remedy for care, --
a contrast to our respites
how different we are
xiii
cobwebs
the spider as an artist
has never been employed
though his surpassing merit
is freely certified
by every broom and bridget
throughout a christian land
neglected son of genius,
i take thee by the hand
xiv
a well
what mystery pervades a well
the water lives so far,
like neighbor from another world
residing in a jar
the grass does not appear afraid
i often wonder he
can stand so close and look so bold
at what is dread to me
related somehow they may be, --
the sedge stands next the sea,
where he is floorless, yet of fear
no evidence gives he
but nature is a stranger yet
the ones that cite her most
have never passed her haunted house,
nor simplified her ghost
to pity those that know her not
is helped by the regret
that those who know her, know her less
the nearer her they get
xv
to make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee, --
one clover, and a bee,
and revery
the revery alone will do
if bees are few
xvi
the wind
its like the light, --
a fashionless delight
its like the bee, --
a dateless melody
its like the woods,
private like breeze,
phraseless, yet it stirs
the proudest trees
its like the morning, --
best when its done, --
the everlasting clocks
chime noon
xvii
a dew sufficed itself
and satisfied a leaf,
and felt, how vast a destiny
how trivial is life
the sun went out to work,
the day went out to play,
but not again that dew was seen
by physiognomy
whether by day abducted,
or emptied by the sun
into the sea, in passing,
eternally unknown
xviii
the woodpecker
his bill an auger is,
his head, a cap and frill
he laboreth at every tree, --
a worm his utmost goal
xix
a snake
sweet is the swamp with its secrets,
until we meet a snake
t is then we sigh for houses,
and our departure take
at that enthralling gallop
that only childhood knows
a snake is summers treason,
and guile is where it goes
xx
could i but ride indefinite,
as doth the meadow-bee,
and visit only where i liked,
and no man visit me,
and flirt all day with buttercups,
and marry whom i may,
and dwell a little everywhere,
or better, run away
with no police to follow,
or chase me if i do,
till i should jump peninsulas
to get away from you, --
i said, but just to be a bee
upon a raft of air,
and row in nowhere all day long,
and anchor off the bar,--
what liberty so captives deem
who tight in dungeons are
xxi
the moon
the moon was but a chin of gold
a night or two ago,
and now she turns her perfect face
upon the world below
her forehead is of amplest blond
her cheek like beryl stone
her eye unto the summer dew
the likest i have known
her lips of amber never part
but what must be the smile
upon her friend she could bestow
were such her silver will
and what a privilege to be
but the remotest star
for certainly her way might pass
beside your twinkling door
her bonnet is the firmament,
the universe her shoe,
the stars the trinkets at her belt,
her dimities of blue
xxii
the bat
the bat is dun with wrinkled wings
like fallow article,
and not a song pervades his lips,
or none perceptible
his small umbrella, quaintly halved,
describing in the air
an arc alike inscrutable, --
elate philosopher
deputed from what firmament
of what astute abode,
empowered with what malevolence
auspiciously withheld
to his adroit creator
ascribe no less the praise
beneficent, believe me,
his eccentricities
xxiii
the balloon
youve seen balloons set, havent you?
so stately they ascend
it is as swans discarded you
for duties diamond
their liquid feet go softly out
upon a sea of blond
they spurn the air as t were too mean
for creatures so renowned
their ribbons just beyond the eye,
they struggle some for breath,
and yet the crowd applauds below
they would not encore death
the gilded creature strains and spins,
trips frantic in a tree,
tears open her imperial veins
and tumbles in the sea
the crowd retire with an oath
the dust in streets goes down,
and clerks in counting-rooms observe,
t was only a balloon
xxiv
evening
the cricket sang,
and set the sun,
and workmen finished, one by one,
their seam the day upon
the low grass loaded with the dew,
the twilight stood as strangers do
with hat in hand, polite and new,
to stay as if, or go
a vastness, as a neighbor, came, --
a wisdom without face or name,
a peace, as hemispheres at home, --
and so the night became
xxv
cocoon
drab habitation of whom?
tabernacle or tomb,
or dome of worm,
or porch of gnome,
or some elfs catacomb?
xxvi
sunset
a sloop of amber slips away
upon an ether sea,
and wrecks in peace a purple tar,
the son of ecstasy

aurora
of bronze and blaze
the north, to-night
so adequate its forms,
so preconcerted with itself,
so distant to alarms, --
an unconcern so sovereign
to universe, or me,
it paints my simple spirit
with tints of majesty,
till i take vaster attitudes,
and strut upon my stem,
disdaining men and oxygen,
for arrogance of them
my splendors are menagerie
but their competeless show
will entertain the centuries
when i am, long ago,
an island in dishonored grass,
whom none but daisies know
xxviii
the coming of night
how the old mountains drip with sunset,
and the brake of dun
how the hemlocks are tipped in tinsel
by the wizard sun
how the old steeples hand the scarlet,
till the ball is full, --
have i the lip of the flamingo
that i dare to tell?
then, how the fire ebbs like billows,
touching all the grass
with a departing, sapphire feature,
as if a duchess pass
how a small dusk crawls on the village
till the houses blot
and the odd flambeaux no men carry
glimmer on the spot
now it is night in nest and kennel,
and where was the wood,
just a dome of abyss is nodding
into solitude --
these are the visions baffled guido
titian never told
domenichino dropped the pencil,
powerless to unfold
xxix
aftermath
the murmuring of bees has ceased
but murmuring of some
posterior, prophetic,
has simultaneous come, --
the lower metres of the year,
when natures laugh is done, --
the revelations of the book
whose genesis is june
iv time and eternity
i
this world is not conclusion
a sequel stands beyond,
invisible, as music,
but positive, as sound
it beckons and it baffles
philosophies dont know,
and through a riddle, at the last,
sagacity must go
to guess it puzzles scholars
to gain it, men have shown
contempt of generations,
and crucifixion known
ii
we learn in the retreating
how vast an one
was recently among us
a perished sun
endears in the departure
how doubly more
than all the golden presence
it was before
iii
they say that time assuages, --
time never did assuage
an actual suffering strengthens,
as sinews do, with age
time is a test of trouble,
but not a remedy
if such it prove, it prove too
there was no malady
iv
we cover thee, sweet face
not that we tire of thee,
but that thyself fatigue of us
remember, as thou flee,
we follow thee until
thou notice us no more,
and then, reluctant, turn away
to con thee oer and oer,
and blame the scanty love
we were content to show,
augmented, sweet, a hundred fold
if thou wouldst take it now
v
ending
that is solemn we have ended, --
be it but a play,
or a glee among the garrets,
or a holiday,
or a leaving home or later,
parting with a world
we have understood, for better
still it be unfurled
vi
the stimulus, beyond the grave
his countenance to see,
supports me like imperial drams
afforded royally
vii
given in marriage unto thee,
oh, thou celestial host
bride of the father and the son,
bride of the holy ghost
other betrothal shall dissolve,
wedlock of will decay
only the keeper of this seal
conquers mortality
viii
that such have died enables us
the tranquiller to die
that such have lived, certificate
for immortality
ix
they wont frown always, -- some sweet day
when i forget to tease,
theyll recollect how cold i looked,
and how i just said please
then they will hasten to the door
to call the little child,
who cannot thank them, for the ice
that on her lisping piled
x
immortality
it is an honorable thought,
and makes one lift ones hat,
as one encountered gentlefolk
upon a daily street,
that weve immortal place,
though pyramids decay,
and kingdoms, like the orchard,
flit russetly away
xi
the distance that the dead have gone
does not at first appear
their coming back seems possible
for many an ardent year
and then, that we have followed them
we more than half suspect,
so intimate have we become
with their dear retrospect
xii
how dare the robins sing,
when men and women hear
who since they went to their account
have settled with the year --
paid all that life had earned
in one consummate bill,
and now, what life or death can do
is immaterial
insulting is the sun
to him whose mortal light,
beguiled of immortality,
bequeaths him to the night
in deference to him
extinct be every hum,
whose garden wrestles with the dew,
at daybreak overcome
xiii
death
death is like the insect
menacing the tree,
competent to kill it,
but decoyed may be
bait it with the balsam,
seek it with the knife,
baffle, if it cost you
everything in life
then, if it have burrowed
out of reach of skill,
ring the tree and leave it, --
t is the vermins will
xiv
unwarned
t is sunrise, little maid, hast thou
no station in the day?
t was not thy wont to hinder so, --
retrieve thine industry
t is noon, my little maid, alas
and art thou sleeping yet?
the lily waiting to be wed,
the bee, dost thou forget?
my little maid, t is night alas,
that night should be to thee
instead of morning hadst thou broached
thy little plan to me,
dissuade thee if i could not, sweet,
i might have aided thee
xv
each that we lose takes part of us
a crescent still abides,
which like the moon, some turbid night,
is summoned by the tides
xvi
not any higher stands the grave
for heroes than for men
not any nearer for the child
than numb three-score and ten
this latest leisure equal lulls
the beggar and his queen
propitiate this democrat
by summers gracious mien
xvii
asleep
as far from pity as complaint,
as cool to speech as stone,
as numb to revelation
as if my trade were bone
as far from time as history,
as near yourself to-day
as children to the rainbows scarf,
or sunsets yellow play
to eyelids in the sepulchre
how still the dancer lies,
while colors revelations break,
and blaze the butterflies
xviii
the spirit
t is whiter than an indian pipe,
t is dimmer than a lace
no stature has it, like a fog,
when you approach the place
not any voice denotes it here,
or intimates it there
a spirit, how doth it accost?
what customs hath the air?
this limitless hyperbole
each one of us shall be
t is drama, if hypothesis
it be not tragedy
xix
the monument
she laid her docile crescent down,
and this mechanic stone
still states, to dates that have forgot,
the news that she is gone
so constant to its stolid trust,
the shaft that never knew,
it shames the constancy that fled
before its emblem flew
xx
bless god, he went as soldiers,
his musket on his breast
grant, god, he charge the bravest
of all the martial blest
please god, might i behold him
in epauletted white,
i should not fear the foe then,
i should not fear the fight
xxi
immortal is an ample word
when what we need is by,
but when it leaves us for a time,
t is a necessity
of heaven above the firmest proof
we fundamental know,
except for its marauding hand,
it had been heaven below
xxii
where every bird is bold to go,
and bees abashless play,
the foreigner before he knocks
must thrust the tears away
xxiii
the grave my little cottage is,
where, keeping house for thee,
i make my parlor orderly,
and lay the marble tea,
for two divided, briefly,
a cycle, it may be,
till everlasting life unite
in strong society
xxiv
this was in the white of the year,
that was in the green,
drifts were as difficult then to think
as daisies now to be seen
looking back is best that is left,
or if it be before,
retrospection is prospects half,
sometimes almost more
xxv
sweet hours have perished here
this is a mighty room
within its precincts hopes have played, --
now shadows in the tomb
xxvi
me come my dazzled face
in such a shining place
me hear my foreign ear
the sounds of welcome near
the saints shall meet
our bashful feet
my holiday shall be
that they remember me
my paradise, the fame
that they pronounce my name
xxvii
invisible
from us she wandered now a year,
her tarrying unknown
if wilderness prevent her feet,
or that ethereal zone
no eye hath seen and lived,
we ignorant must be
we only know what time of year
we took the mystery
xxviii
i wish i knew that womans name,
so, when she comes this way,
to hold my life, and hold my ears,
for fear i hear her say
shes sorry i am dead, again,
just when the grave and i
have sobbed ourselves almost to sleep, --
our only lullaby
xxix
trying to forget
bereaved of all, i went abroad,
no less bereaved to be
upon a new peninsula, --
the grave preceded me,
obtained my lodgings ere myself,
and when i sought my bed,
the grave it was, reposed upon
the pillow for my head
i waked, to find it first awake,
i rose, -- it followed me
i tried to drop it in the crowd,
to lose it in the sea,
in cups of artificial drowse
to sleep its shape away, --
the grave was finished, but the spade
remained in memory
xxx
i felt a funeral in my brain,
and mourners, to and fro,
kept treading, treading, till it seemed
that sense was breaking through
and when they all were seated,
a service like a drum
kept beating, beating, till i thought
my mind was going numb
and then i heard them lift a box,
and creak across my soul
with those same boots of lead, again
then space began to toll
as all the heavens were a bell,
and being but an ear,
and i and silence some strange race,
wrecked, solitary, here
xxxi
i meant to find her when i came
death had the same design
but the success was his, it seems,
and the discomfit mine
i meant to tell her how i longed
for just this single time
but death had told her so the first,
and she had hearkened him
to wander now is my abode
to rest, -- to rest would be
a privilege of hurricane
to memory and me
xxxii
waiting
i sing to use the waiting,
my bonnet but to tie,
and shut the door unto my house
no more to do have i,
till, his best step approaching,
we journey to the day,
and tell each other how we sang
to keep the dark away
xxxiii
a sickness of this world it most occasions
when best men die
a wishfulness their far condition
to occupy
a chief indifference, as foreign
a world must be
themselves forsake contented,
for deity
xxxiv
superfluous were the sun
when excellence is dead
he were superfluous every day,
for every day is said
that syllable whose faith
just saves it from despair,
and whose ill meet you hesitates
if love inquire, where?
upon his dateless fame
our periods may lie,
as stars that drop anonymous
from an abundant sky
xxxv
so proud she was to die
it made us all ashamed
that what we cherished, so unknown
to her desire seemed
so satisfied to go
where none of us should be,
immediately, that anguish stooped
almost to jealousy
xxxvi
farewell
tie the strings to my life, my lord,
then i am ready to go
just a look at the horses --
rapid that will do
put me in on the firmest side,
so i shall never fall
for we must ride to the judgment,
and its partly down hill
but never i mind the bridges,
and never i mind the sea
held fast in everlasting race
by my own choice and thee
good-by to the life i used to live,
and the world i used to know
and kiss the hills for me, just once
now i am ready to go
xxxvii
the dying need but little, dear, --
a glass of waters all,
a flowers unobtrusive face
to punctuate the wall,
a fan, perhaps, a friends regret,
and certainly that one
no color in the rainbow
perceives when you are gone
xxxviii
dead
theres something quieter than sleep
within this inner room
it wears a sprig upon its breast,
and will not tell its name
some touch it and some kiss it,
some chafe its idle hand
it has a simple gravity
i do not understand
while simple-hearted neighbors
chat of the early dead,
we, prone to periphrasis,
remark that birds have fled
xxxix
the soul should always stand ajar,
that if the heaven inquire,
he will not be obliged to wait,
or shy of troubling her
depart, before the host has slid
the bolt upon the door,
to seek for the accomplished guest, --
her visitor no more
xl
three weeks passed since i had seen her, --
some disease had vexed
t was with text and village singing
i beheld her next,
and a company -- our pleasure
to discourse alone
gracious now to me as any,
gracious unto none
borne, without dissent of either,
to the parish night
of the separated people
which are out of sight?
xli
i breathed enough to learn the trick,
and now, removed from air,
i simulate the breath so well,
that one, to be quite sure
the lungs are stirless, must descend
among the cunning cells,
and touch the pantomime himself
how cool the bellows feels
xlii
i wonder if the sepulchre
is not a lonesome way,
when men and boys, and larks and june
go down the fields to hay
xliii
joy in death
if tolling bell i ask the cause
a soul has gone to god,
im answered in a lonesome tone
is heaven then so sad?
that bells should joyful ring to tell
a soul had gone to heaven,
would seem to me the proper way
a good news should be given
xliv
if i may have it when its dead
i will contented be
if just as soon as breath is out
it shall belong to me,
until they lock it in the grave,
t is bliss i cannot weigh,
for though they lock thee in the grave,
myself can hold the key
think of it, lover i and thee
permitted face to face to be
after a life, a death well say, --
for death was that, and this is thee
xlv
before the ice is in the pools,
before the skaters go,
or any cheek at nightfall
is tarnished by the snow,
before the fields have finished,
before the christmas tree,
wonder upon wonder
will arrive to me
what we touch the hems of
on a summers day
what is only walking
just a bridge away
that which sings so, speaks so,
when theres no one here, --
will the frock i wept in
answer me to wear?
xlvi
dying
i heard a fly buzz when i died
the stillness round my form
was like the stillness in the air
between the heaves of storm
the eyes beside had wrung them dry,
and breaths were gathering sure
for that last onset, when the king
be witnessed in his power
i willed my keepsakes, signed away
what portion of me i
could make assignable, -- and then
there interposed a fly,
with blue, uncertain, stumbling buzz,
between the light and me
and then the windows failed, and then
i could not see to see
xlvii
adrift a little boat adrift
and night is coming down
will no one guide a little boat
unto the nearest town?
so sailors say, on yesterday,
just as the dusk was brown,
one little boat gave up its strife,
and gurgled down and down
but angels say, on yesterday,
just as the dawn was red,
one little boat oerspent with gales
retrimmed its masts, redecked its sails
exultant, onward sped
xlviii
theres been a death in the opposite house
as lately as to-day
i know it by the numb look
such houses have alway
the neighbors rustle in and out,
the doctor drives away
a window opens like a pod,
abrupt, mechanically
somebody flings a mattress out, --
the children hurry by
they wonder if it died on that, --
i used to when a boy
the minister goes stiffly in
as if the house were his,
and he owned all the mourners now,
and little boys besides
and then the milliner, and the man
of the appalling trade,
to take the measure of the house
therell be that dark parade
of tassels and of coaches soon
its easy as a sign, --
the intuition of the news
in just a country town
xlix
we never know we go, -- when we are going
we jest and shut the door
fate following behind us bolts it,
and we accost no more
l
the souls storm
it struck me every day
the lightning was as new
as if the cloud that instant slit
and let the fire through
it burned me in the night,
it blistered in my dream
it sickened fresh upon my sight
with every mornings beam
i thought that storm was brief, --
the maddest, quickest by
but nature lost the date of this,
and left it in the sky
li
water is taught by thirst
land, by the oceans passed
transport, by throe
peace, by its battles told
love, by memorial mould
birds, by the snow
lii
thirst
we thirst at first, -- t is natures act
and later, when we die,
a little water supplicate
of fingers going by
it intimates the finer want,
whose adequate supply
is that great water in the west
termed immortality
liii
a clock stopped -- not the mantels
genevas farthest skill
cant put the puppet bowing
that just now dangled still
an awe came on the trinket
the figures hunched with pain,
then quivered out of decimals
into degreeless noon
it will not stir for doctors,
this pendulum of snow
the shopman importunes it,
while cool, concernless no
nods from the gilded pointers,
nods from the seconds slim,
decades of arrogance between
the dial life and him
liv
charlotte brontes grave
all overgrown by cunning moss,
all interspersed with weed,
the little cage of currer bell,
in quiet haworth laid
this bird, observing others,
when frosts too sharp became,
retire to other latitudes,
quietly did the same,
but differed in returning
since yorkshire hills are green,
yet not in all the nests i meet
can nightingale be seen
gathered from many wanderings,
gethsemane can tell
through what transporting anguish
she reached the asphodel
soft fall the sounds of eden
upon her puzzled ear
oh, what an afternoon for heaven,
when bronte entered there
lv
a toad can die of light
death is the common right
of toads and men, --
of earl and midge
the privilege
why swagger then?
the gnats supremacy
is large as thine
lvi
far from love the heavenly father
leads the chosen child
oftener through realm of briar
than the meadow mild,
oftener by the claw of dragon
than the hand of friend,
guides the little one predestined
to the native land
lvii
sleeping
a long, long sleep, a famous sleep
that makes no show for dawn
by stretch of limb or stir of lid, --
an independent one
was ever idleness like this?
within a hut of stone
to bask the centuries away
nor once look up for noon?
lviii
retrospect
t was just this time last year i died
i know i heard the corn,
when i was carried by the farms, --
it had the tassels on
i thought how yellow it would look
when richard went to mill
and then i wanted to get out,
but something held my will
i thought just how red apples wedged
the stubbles joints between
and carts went stooping round the fields
to take the pumpkins in
i wondered which would miss me least,
and when thanksgiving came,
if fatherd multiply the plates
to make an even sum
and if my stocking hung too high,
would it blur the christmas glee,
that not a santa claus could reach
the altitude of me?
but this sort grieved myself, and so
i thought how it would be
when just this time, some perfect year,
themselves should come to me
lix
eternity
on this wondrous sea,
sailing silently,
ho pilot, ho
knowest thou the shore
where no breakers roar,
where the storm is oer?
in the silent west
many sails at rest,
their anchors fast
thither i pilot thee, --
land, ho eternity
ashore at last
