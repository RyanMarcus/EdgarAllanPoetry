conversation among the ruins
through portico of my elegant house you stalk
with your wild furies, disturbing garlands of fruit
and the fabulous lutes and peacocks, rending the net
of all decorum which holds the whirlwind back
now, rich order of walls is fallen rooks croak
above the appalling ruin in bleak light
of your stormy eye, magic takes flight
like a daunted witch, quitting castle when real days break
fractured pillars frame prospects of rock
while you stand heroic in coat and tie, i sit
composed in grecian tunic and psycheknot,
rooted to your black look, the play turned tragic
with such blight wrought on our bankrupt estate,
what ceremony of words can patch the havoc ?
winter landscape, with rooks
water in the millrace, through a sluice of stone,
plunges headlong into that black pond
where, absurd and outofseason, a single swan
floats chaste as snow, taunting the clouded mind
which hungers to haul the white reflection down
the austere sun descends above the fen,
an orange cyclopseye, scorning to look
longer on this landscape of chagrin
feathered dark in thought, i stalk like a rook,
brooding as the winter night comes on
last summers reeds are all engraved in ice
as is your image in my eye dry frost
glazes the window of my hurt what solace
can be struck from rock to make hearts waste
grow green again ? whod walk in this bleak place ?
pursuit
dans lefond des forks votre image me suit

there is a panther stalks me down
one day ill have my death of him
his greed has set the woods aflame,
he prowls more lordly than the sun
most soft, most suavely glides that step,
advancing always at my back
from gaunt hemlock, rooks croak havoc
the hunt is on, and sprung the trap
flayed by thorns i trek the rocks,
haggard through the hot white noon
along red network of his veins
what fires run, what craving wakes ?
insatiate, he ransacks the land
condemned by our ancestral fault,
crying blood, let blood be spilt
meat must glut his mouths raw wound
keen the rending teeth and sweet
the singeing fury of his fur
his kisses parch, each paws a briar,
doom consummates that appetite
in the wake of this fierce cat,
kindled like torches for his joy,
charred and ravened women lie,
become his starving bodys bait
now hills hatch menace, spawning shade
midnight cloaks the sultry grove
the black marauder, hauled by love

on fluent haunches, keeps my speed
behind snarled thickets of my eyes
lurks the lithe one in dreams ambush
bright those claws that mar the flesh
and hungry, hungry, those taut thighs
his ardor snares me, lights the trees,
and i run flaring in my skin
what lull, what cool can lap me in
when burns and brands that yellow gaze?
i hurl my heart to halt his pace,
to quench his thirst i squander blood
he eats, and still his need seeks food,
compels a total sacrifice
his voice waylays me, spells a trance,
the gutted forest falls to ash
appalled by secret want, i rush
from such assault of radiance
entering the tower of my fears,
i shut my doors on that dark guilt,
i bolt the door, each door i bolt
blood quickens, gonging in my ears
the panthers tread is on the stairs,
coming up and up the stairs

bucolics
mayday two came to field in such wise
a daisied mead, each said to each,
so were they one so sought they couch,
across barbed stile, through flocked brown cows
no pitchforked farmer, please, she said
may cockcrow guard us safe, said he
by blackthorn thicket, flower spray
they pitched their coats, come to green bed
i
below a fen where water stood
aslant their hill of stinging nettle
then, honorbound, mute grazing cattle
above leafwraithed white air, white cloud
all afternoon these lovers lay
until the sun turned pale from warm,
until sweet wind changed tune, blew harm
cruel nettles stung her ankles raw
rueful, most vexed, that tender skin
should accept so fell a wound,
he stamped and cracked stalks to the ground
which had caused his dear girl pain
now he goes from his rightful road
and, under honor, will depart
while she stands burning, venomgirt,
in wait for sharper smart to fade

tale of a tub
the photographic chamber of the eye
records bare painted walls, while an electric light
flays the chromium nerves of plumbing raw
such poverty assaults the ego caught
naked in the merely actual room,
the stranger in the lavatory mirror
puts on a public grin, repeats our name
but scrupulously reflects the usual terror
just how guilty are we when the ceiling
reveals no cracks that can be decoded ? when washbowl
maintains it has no more holy calling
than physical ablution, and the towel
dryly disclaims that fierce troll faces lurk
in its explicit folds ? or when the window,
blind with steam, will not admit the dark
which shrouds our prospects in ambiguous shadow ?
i
twenty years ago, the familiar tub
bred an ample batch of omens but now
water faucets spawn no danger each crab
and octopusscrabbling just beyond the view,
waiting for some accidental break
in ritual, to strikeis definitely gone
the authentic sea denies them and will pluck
fantastic flesh down to the honest bone
we take the plunge under water our limbs
waver, faintly green, shuddering away
from the genuine color of skin can our dreams
ever blur the intransigent lines which draw
the shape that shuts us in ? absolute fact
intrudes even when the revolted eye
is closed the tub exists behind our back
its glittering surfaces are blank and true
yet always the ridiculous nude flanks urge
the fabrication of some cloth to cover
such starkness accuracy must not stalk at large
each day demands we create our whole world over,
disguising the constant horror in a coat
of manycolored fictions we mask our past
in the green of eden, pretend futures shining fruit
can sprout from the navel of this present waste
in this particular tub, two knees jut up
like icebergs, while minute brown hairs rise
on arms and legs in a fringe of kelp green soap
navigates the tidal slosh of seas
breaking on legendary beaches in faith
we shall board our imagined ship and wildly sail
among sacred islands of the mad till death
shatters the fabulous stars and makes us real


southern sunrise
color of lemon, mango, peach,
these storybook villas
still dream behind
shutters, their balconies
fine as hand
made lace, or a leafandflower pensketch
tilting with the winds,
on arrowy stems,
pineapplebarked,
a green crescent of palms
sends up its forked
firework of fronds
a quartzclear dawn
inch by bright inch
gilds all our avenue,
and out of the blue drench
of angels bay
rises the round red watermelon sun
channel crossing
on stormstruck deck, wind sirens caterwaul
with each tilt, shock and shudder, our blunt ship
cleaves forward into fury dark as anger,
waves wallop, assaulting the stubborn hull
flayed by spray, we take the challenge up,
grip the rail, squint ahead, and wonder how much longer
such force can last but beyond, the neutral view
shows, rank on rank, the hungry seas advancing
below, rocked havocsick, voyagers lie
retching in bright orange basins a refugee
sprawls, hunched in black, among baggage, wincing
under the strict mask of his agony
i
far from the sweet stench of that perilous air
in which our comrades are betrayed, we freeze
and marvel at the smashing nonchalance
of nature what better way to test taut fiber
than against this onslaught, these casual blasts of ice
that wrestle with us like angels the mere chance
of making harbor through this racketing flux
taunts us to valor blue sailors sang that our journey
would be full of sun, white gulls, and water drenched
with radiance, peacockcolored instead, bleak rocks
jutted early to mark our going, while sky
curded over with clouds and chalk cliffs blanched
in sullen light of the inauspicious day
now, free, by hazards quirk, from the common ill
knocking our brothers down, we strike a stance
most mockheroic, to cloak our waking awe
at this rare rumpus which no man can control
meek and proud both fall stark violence
lays all walls waste private estates are torn,
ransacked in the public eye we forsake
our lone luck now, compelled by bond, by blood,
to keep some unsaid pact perhaps concern
is helpless here, quite extra, yet we must make
the gesture, bend and hold the prone mans head
and so we sail toward cities, streets and homes
of other men, where statues celebrate
brave acts played out in peace, in war all dangers
end green shores appear we assume our names,
our luggage, as docks halt our brief epic no debt
survives arrival we walk the plank with strangers

prospect
among orangetile rooftops
and chimney pots
the fen fog slips,
gray as rats,
while on spotted branch
of the sycamore
two black rooks hunch
and darkly glare,
watching for night,
with absinthe eye
cocked on the lone, late,
passerby
the queens complaint
in ruck and quibble of courtfolk
this giant hulked, i tell you, on her scene
with hands like derricks,
looks fierce and black as rooks
why, all the windows broke when he stalked in
her dainty acres he ramped through
and used her gentle doves with manners rude
i do not know
what fury urged him slay
her antelope who meant him naught but good
she spoke most chiding in his ear
till he some pity took upon her crying
of rich attire
he made her shoulders bare
and solaced her, but quit her at cocks crowing

a hundred heralds she sent out
to summon in her slight all doughty men
whose force might fit
shape of her sleep, her thought
none of that greenhorn lot matched her bright crown
so she is come to this rare pass
whereby she treks in blood through sun and squall
and sings you thus
how sad, alas, it is
to see my people shrunk so small, so small

born green we were
to this flawed garden,
but in speckled thickets, warted as a toad,
spitefully skulks our warden,
fixing his snare
which hauls down buck, cock, trout, till all most fair
is tricked to falter in spilt blood
now our whole tasks to hack
some angelshape worth wearing
from his crabbed midden where alls wrought so awry
that no straight inquiring
could unlock
shrewd catch silting our each bright act back
to unmade mud cloaked by sour sky
sweet salts warped stem
of weeds we tackle towards ways rank ending
scorched by red sun
we heft globed flint, racked in veins barbed bindings
brave love, dream
not of staunching such strict flame, but come,
lean to my wound burn on, burn on
song for a summers day
through fen and farmland walking
with my own country love
i saw slow flocked cows move

white hulks on their days cruising
sweet grass sprang for their grazing
the air was bright for looking
most far in blue, aloft,
clouds steered a burnished drift
larks nip and tuck arising
came in for my loves praising
sheen of the noon sun striking
took my heart as if
it were a greentipped leaf
kindled by my loves pleasing
into an ardent blazing
and so, together, talking,
through sundays honeyair
we walked and still walk there
out of the suns bruising
till the night mists came rising

two sisters of persephone
two girls there are within the house
one sits the other, without
daylong a duet of shade and light
plays between these
in her dark wainscoted room
the first works problems on
a mathematical machine
dry ticks mark time
as she calculates each sum
at this barren enterprise
ratshrewd go her squint eyes,
rootpale her meager frame
ibronzed as earth, the second lies,
hearing ticks blown gold
like pollen on bright air lulled
near a bed of poppies,
she sees how their red silk flare
of petaled blood
burns open to suns blade
on that green altar
freely become suns bride, the latter
grows quick with seed
grasscouched in her labors pride,
she bears a king turned bitter
and sallow as any lemon,
the other, wry virgin to the last,
goes graveward with flesh laid waste,
wormhusbanded, yet no woman

vanity fair
through frostthick weather
this witch sidles, fingers crooked, as if
caught in a hazardous medium that might
merely by its continuing
attach her to heaven
at eyes envious corner
crowsfeet copy veining on stained leaf
cold squint steals skys color while bruit
of bells calls holy ones, her tongue
backtalks at the raven
cleaving furred air
over her skulls midden no knife
rivals her whetted look, divining what conceit
waylays simple girls, churchgoing,
and what hearts oven
i
craves most to cook batter
rich in strayings with every amorous oaf,
ready, for a trinket,
to squander owlhours on bracken bedding,
flesh unshriven
against virgin prayer
this sorceress sets mirrors enough
to distract beautys thought
lovesick at first fond song,
each vain girls driven
to believe beyond hearts flare
no fire is, nor in any book proof
sun hoists soul up after lids fall shut
so she wills all to the black king
the worst sloven
vies with best queen over
right to blaze as satans wife
housed in earth, those million brides shriek out
some burn short, some long,
staked in prides coven

strumpet song
with white frost gone
and all green dreams not worth much,
after a lean days work
time comes round for that foul slut
mere bruit of her takes our street
until every man,
red, pale or dark,
veers to her slouch
mark, i cry, that mouth
made to do violence on,
that seamed face
askew with blotch, dint, scar

struck by each dour year
walks there not some such one man
as can spare breath
to patch with brand of love this rank grimace
which out from black tarn, ditch and cup
into my most chaste own eyes
looks up

tinker jack and the tidy wives
come lady, bring that pot
gone black of polish
and whatever pan this mending master
should trim back to shape
ill correct each mar
on silver dish,
and shine that kettle of copper
at your fireside
bright as blood
come lady, bring that face
fallen from luster
times soot in bleared eye
can be made to glister
for small charge
no forms gone so awry,
crookback or bandyleg,
but tinker jack can forge
beauty from hag
whatever scath
fierce fires wrought
jack will touch up
and fit for use
what scars been knocked
into cracked heart
jack shall repair

and if there be
young wives still blithe,
still fair,
whose labors not yet smoked
their fine skin sere,
from their white heat
before he part
let jack catch fire
faun
haunched like a faun, he hooed
from grove of moonglint and fenfrost
until all owls in the twigged forest
flapped black to look and brood
on the call this man made
no sound but a drunken coot
lurching home along river bank
stars hung watersunk, so a rank
of double stareyes lit
boughs where those owls sat
an arena of yellow eyes
watched the changing shape he cut,
saw hoof harden from foot, saw sprout
goathorns marked how god rose
and galloped woodward in that guise
street song
by a mad miracle i go intact
among the common rout
thronging sidewalk, street,
and bickering shops
nobody blinks a lid, gapes,
or cries that this raw flesh

reeks of the butchers cleaver,
its heart and guts hung hooked
and bloodied as a cows split frame
parceled out by whitejacketed assassins
oh no, for i strut it clever
as a greenly escaped idiot,
buying wine, bread,
yellowcasqued chrysanthemums
arming myself with the most reasonable items
to ward off, at all cost, suspicions
roused by thorned hands, feet, head,
and that great wound
squandering red
from the flayed side
even as my each mangled nerveend
trills its hurt out
above pitch of pedestrian ear,
so, perhaps i, knelled dumb by your absence,
alone can hear
suns parched scream,
every downfall and crash
of gutted star,
and, more daft than any goose,
this cracked worlds incessant gabble and hiss

letter to a purist
that grandiose colossus who
stood astride
the envious assaults of sea
essaying, wave by wave,
tide by tide,
to undo him, perpetually,
has nothing on you,
o my loxe y
i
o my great idiot, who
with one foot
caught as it were in the mucktrap
of skin and bone,
dithers with the other way out
in preposterous provinces of the madcap
cloudcuckoo,
agawp at the impeccable moon
soliloquy of the solipsist
i?
i walk alone
the midnight street
spins itself from under my feet
when my eyes shut
these dreaming houses all snuff out
through a whim of mine
over gables the moons celestial onion
hangs high
i
make houses shrink
and trees diminish
by going far my looks leash
dangles the puppetpeople
who, unaware how they dwindle,
laugh, kiss, get drunk,
nor guess that if i choose to blink
they die
i
when in good humor,
give grass its green
blazon sky blue, and endow the sun
with gold
yet, in my wintriest moods, i hold
absolute power
to boycott color and forbid any flower
to be
i
know you appear
vivid at my side,
denying you sprang out of my head,
claiming you feel
love fiery enough to prove flesh real,
though its quite clear
all your beauty, all your wit, is a gift, my dear,

dialogue between ghost and priest
in the rectory garden on his evening walk
paced brisk father shawn a cold day, a sodden one it was
in black november after a sliding rain
dew stood in chill sweat on each stalk,
each thorn spiring from wet earth, a blue haze
hung caught in darkwebbed branches like a fabulous heron
hauled sudden from solitude,
hair prickling on his head,
father shawn perceived a ghost
shaping itself from that mist
how now, father shawn crisply addressed the ghost
wavering there, gauzeedged, smelling of woodsmoke,
what manner of business are you on ?
from your blue pallor, id say you inhabited the frozen waste
of hell, and not the fiery part yet to judge by that dazzled look,
that noble mien, perhaps youve late quitted heaven?
in voice furred with frost,
ghost said to priest
neither of those countries do i frequent
earth is my haunt

come, come, father shawn gave an impatient shrug,
i dont ask you to spin some ridiculous fable
of gilded harps or gnawing fire simply tell
after your lifes end, what just epilogue
god ordained to follow up your days is it such trouble
to satisfy the questions of a curious old fool?
in life, love gnawed my skin
to this white bone
what love did then, love does now
gnaws me through
what love, asked father shawn, but too great love
of flawed earthflesh could cause this sorry pass ?
some damned condition you are in
thinking never to have left the world, you grieve
as though alive, shriveling in torment thus
to atone as shade for sin that lured blind man
the day of doom
is not yet come
until that time
a crock of dust is my dear home
fond phantom, cried shocked father shawn,
can there be such stubbornness
a soul grown feverish, clutching its dead bodytree
like a last stormcrossed leaf? best get you gone
to judgment in a higher court of grace
repent, depart, before gods trumpcrack splits the sky
from that pale mist
ghost swore to priest
there sits no higher court
than mans red heart
i
the glutton
he, hungerstung, hard to slake,
so fitted is for my black luck
with heat such as no man could have
and yet keep kind
that all merits in being meat
seasoned how hed most approve
bloods broth,
filched by his hand,
choice wassail makes, cooked hot,
cupped quick to mouth
though prime parts cram each rich meal,
hell not spare
nor scant his want until
sacked larders gone bonebare
monologue at  am
better that every fiber crack
and fury make head,
blood drenching vivid
couch, carpet, floor
and the snakefigured almanac
vouching you are
a million green counties from here,
than to sit mute, twitching so
under prickling stars,
with stare, with curse
blackening the time
goodbyes were said, trains let go,
and i, great magnanimous fool, thus wrenched from
my one kingdom
i
miss drake proceeds to supper
no novice
in those elaborate rituals
which allay the malice
of knotted table and crooked chair,
the new woman in the ward
wears purple, steps carefully
among her secret combinations of eggshells
and breakable hummingbirds,
footing sallow as a mouse
between the cabbageroses
which are slowly opening their furred petals
to devour and drag her down
into the carpets design
with birdquick eye cocked askew
she can see in the nick of time
how perilous needles grain the floorboards
and outwit their brambled plan
now through her ambushed air,
adazzle with bright shards
of broken glass,
she edges with wary breath,
fending off jag and tooth,
until, turning sideways,
she lifts one webbed foot after the other
into the still, sultry weather
of the patients dining room
recantation
tea leaves ive given up,
and that crooked line
on the queens palm
is no more my concern
on my black pilgrimage
this moonpocked crystal ball
will break before it help
i
rather than croak out
whats to come,
my darling ravens are flown
forswear those freezing tricks of sight
and all else ive taught
against the flower in the blood
not wealth nor wisdom stands
above the simple vein,
the straight mouth
go to your greenhorn youth
before time ends
and do good
with your white hands

t h e shrike
when night comes black
such royal dreams beckon this man
as lift him apart
from his earthwifes side
to wing, sleepfeathered,
the singular air,
while she, envious bride,
cannot follow after, but lies
with her blank brown eyes starved wide,
twisting curses in the tangled sheet
with taloned fingers,
shaking in her skulls cage
the stuffed shape of her flown mate
escaped among moonplumaged strangers
so hungered, she must wait in rage
until birdracketing dawn
when her shrikeface
leans to peck open those locked lids, to eat
crowns, palace, all
that nightlong stole her male,
and with red beak
spike and suck out
last blooddrop of that truant heart


alicante lullaby
in alicante they bowl the barrels
bumblingly over the nubs of the cobbles
past the yellowpaella eateries,
below the ramshackle backalley balconies,
while the cocks and hens
in the roofgardens
scuttle repose with crowns and cackles
kumquatcolored trolleys ding as they trundle
passengers under an indigo fizzle
needling spumily down from the wires
alongside the sibilant harbor the lovers
hear loudspeakers boom
from each neonlit palm
rumbas and sambas no earflaps can muffle
o cacophony, goddess of jazz and of quarrels,
crackthroated mistress of bagpipes and cymbals,
let be your con brios, your capricciosos,
crescendos, cadenzas, prestos and prestissimos,
my head on the pillow
piano, pianissimo
lullayed by susurrous lyres and viols

dream with clamdiggers
this dream budded bright with leaves around the edges,
its clear air winnowed by angels she was come
back to her early seatown home
scathed, stained after tedious pilgrimages
barefoot, she stood, in shock of that returning,
beside a neighbors house
with shingles burnished as glass,
blinds lowered on that hot morning
ib
no change met her garden terrace, all summer
tanged by melting tar,
sloped seaward to plunge in blue fed by white fire,
the whole scene flared welcome to this roamer
high against heaven, gulls went wheeling soundless
over tidalflats where three children played
silent and shining on a green rock bedded in mud,
their fabulous heyday endless
with green rock gliding, a delicate schooner
decked forth in cockleshells,
they sailed till tide foamed round their ankles
and the fair ship sank, its crew knelled home for dinner
plucked back thus sudden to that far innocence,
she, in her shabby travel garb, began
walking eager toward water, when there, one by one,
clamdiggers rose up out of dark slime at her offense
grim as gargoyles from years spent squatting at seas border
in wait amid snarled weed and wrack of wave
to trap this wayward girl at her first move of love,
now with stake and pitchfork they advance, flint eyes fixed on murder

wreath for a bridal
what though green leaves only witness
such pact as is made once only what matter
that owl voice sole yes, while cows utter
low moos of approve let sun surpliced in brightness
stand stock still to laud these mated ones
whose stark act all coming double luck joins
couched daylong in cloisters of stinging nettle
they lie, cutgrass assaulting each separate sense
with savor coupled so, pure paragons of constance,
this pair seek single state from that dual battle
now speak some sacrament to parry scruple
for wedlock wrought within loves proper chapel

call here with flying colors all watchful birds
to people the twigged aisles lead babel tongues
of animals to choir look what thresh of wings
wields guard of honor over these starred with words
let night bless that luckrooted mead of clover
where, bedded like angels, two burn one in fever
from this holy day on, all pollen blown
shall strew broadcast so rare a seed on wind
that every breath, thus teeming, set the land
sprouting fruit, flowers, children most fair in legion
to slay spawn of dragons teeth speaking this promise,
let flesh be knit, and each step hence go famous
epitaph for fire and flower
you might as well haul up
this waves green peak on wire
to prevent fall, or anchor the fluent air
in quartz, as crack your skull to keep
these two most perishable lovers from the touch
that will kindle angels envy, scorch and drop
their fond hearts charred as any match
seek no stony cameraeye to fix
the passing dazzle of each face
in black and white, or put on ice
mouths instant flare for future looks
stars shoot their petals, and suns run to seed,
however you may sweat to hold such darling wrecks
hived like honey in your head
now in the crux of their vows hang your ear,
still as a shell hear what an age of glass
these lovers prophesy to lock embrace
secure in museum diamond for the stare
of astounded generations they wrestle
to conquer cinders kingdom in the stroke of an hour
and hoard faith safe in a fossil
but though theyd rivet sinews in rock
and have every weathercock kiss hang fire
as if to outflame a phoenix, the moments spur
drives nimble blood too quick
for a wish to tether they ride nightlong
in their heartbeats blazing wake until red cock
plucks bare that comets flowering
dawn snuffs out stars spent wick,
even as loves dear fools cry evergreen,
and a languor of wax congeals the vein
no matter how fiercely lit staunch contracts break
and recoil in the altering light the radiant limb
blows ash in each lovers eye the ardent look
blackens flesh to bone and devours them
fiesta melons
in benidorm there are melons,
whole donkeycarts full
of innumerable melons,
ovals and balls,
bright green and thumpable
laced over with stripes
of turtledark green
choose an eggshape, a worldshape,
bowl one homeward to taste
in the whitehot noon
creamsmooth honeydews,
pinkpulped whoppers,
bumprinded cantaloupes
with orange cores

each wedge wears a studding
of blanched seeds or black seeds
to strew like confetti
under the feet of
this market of meloneating
fiestagoers

the goring
arena dust rusted by four bulls blood to a dull redness,
the afternoon at a bad end under the crowds truculence,
the ritual death each time botched among dropped capes, illjudged
stabs,
the strongest will seemed a will toward ceremony obese, dark
faced in his rich yellows, tassels, pompons, braid, the picador
rode out against the fifth bull to brace his pike and slowly bear
down deep into the bent bullneck cumbrous routine, not artwork
instinct for art began with the bulls horn lofting in the mobs
hush a lumped manshape the whole act formal, fluent as a dance
blood faultlessly broached redeemed the sullied air, the earths grossness

the beggars
nightfall, cold eyeneither disheartens
these goatish tragedians who
hawk misfortune like figs and chickens
and, plaintiff against each day, decry
natures partial, haphazard thumb
under white wall and moorish window
griefs honest grimace, debased by time,
caricatures itself and thrives
on the coins of pity at random

a beggar stops among eggs and loaves,
props a legstump upon a crutch,
jiggles his tin cup at the good wives
by lack and loss these beggars encroach
on spirits tenderer than theirs,
sufferingtoughened beyond the fetch
of finest conscience
nightfall obscures
the bays sheer, extravagant blue,
white house and almond grove the beggars
outlast their evilest star, wryly
and with a perfidious verve
baffle the dark, the pitying eye
spider
anansi, black busybody of the folktales,
you scuttle out on impulse
blunt in selfinterest
as a sledge hammer, as a mans bunched fist,
yet of devils the cleverest
to get your carousals told
you spun the cosmic web you squint from center field
last summer i came upon your spanish cousin,
notable robber baron,
behind a goatherds hut
near his small stonehenge above the ants route,
onethird antsize, a leggy spot,
he tripped an ant with a rope
scarcely visible about and about the slope
of his redoubt he ran his nimble filament,
each time round winding that ant
tighter to the cocoon
already veiling the gray spool of stone
i
from which coils, caught ants waved legs in
torpid warning, or lay still
and suffered their livelier fellows to struggle
then briskly scaled his altar tiered with tethered ants,
nodding in a somnolence
appalling to witness,
to the barbarous outlook, from there chose
his next martyr to the gross cause
of concupiscence once more
with black alacrity bound round his prisoner
the antsa file of comers, a file of goers
persevered on a set course
no scruple could disrupt,
obeying orders of instinct till swept
offstage and infamously wrapped
up by a spry black deus
ex machina nor did they seem deterred by this
spinster
now this particular girl
during a ceremonious april walk
with her latest suitor
found herself, of a sudden, intolerably struck
by the birds irregular babel
and the leaves litter
by this tumult afflicted, she
observed her lovers gestures unbalance the air,
his gait stray uneven
through a rank wilderness of fern and flower
she judged petals in disarray,
the whole season, sloven
how she longed for winter then
scrupulously austere in its order
of white and black
ice and rock, each sentiment within border,
i
and hearts frosty discipline
exact as a snowflake
but herea burgeoning
unruly enough to pitch her five queenly wits
into vulgar motley
a treason not to be borne let idiots
reel giddy in bedlam spring
she withdrew neatly
and round her house she set
such a barricade of barb and check
against mutinous weather
as no mere insurgent man could hope to break
with curse, fist, threat
or love, either
rhyme
ive got a stubborn goose whose guts
honeycombed with golden eggs,
yet wont lay one
she, addled in her goosewit, struts
the barnyard like those taloned hags
who ogle men
and crimp their wrinkles in a grin,
jangling their great money bags
while i eat grits
she fattens on the finest grain
now, as i hone my knife, she begs
pardon, and thats
so humbly done, id turn this keen
steel on myself before profit
by such a rogues
act, buthow those feathers shine
exit from a smoking slit
her ruby dregs

departure
the figs on the fig tree in the yard are green
green, also, the grapes on the green vine
shading the brickred porch tiles
the moneys run out
how nature, sensing this, compounds her bitters
ungifted, ungrieved, our leavetaking
the sun shines on unripe corn
cats play in the stalks
retrospect shall not soften such penury
suns brass, the moons steely patinas,
the leaden slag of the world
but always expose
the scraggy rock spit shielding the towns blue bay
against which the brunt of outer sea
beats, is brutal endlessly
gullfouled, a stone hut
bares its low lintel to corroding weathers
across the jut of ochreous rock
goats shamble, morose, rankhaired,
to lick the seasalt
maudlin
mudmattressed under the sign of the hag
in a clench of blood, the sleeptalking virgin
gibbets with her curse the moons man,
faggotbearing jack in his crackless egg
hatched with a claret hogshead to swig
he kings it, navelknit to no groan,
but at the price of a pinstitched skin
fishtailed girls purchase each white leg

resolve
day of mist day of tarnish
with hands
unserviceable, i wait
for the milk van
the oneeared cat
laps its gray paw
and the coal fire burns
outside, the little hedge leaves are
become quite yellow
a milkfilm blurs
the empty bottles on the windowsill
no glory descends
two water drops poise
on the arched green
stem of my neighbors rose bush
o bent bow of thorns
the cat unsheathes its claws
the world turns
today
today i will not
disenchant my twelve blackgowned examiners
or bunch my fist
in the winds sneer

landowners
from my rented attic with no earth
to call my own except the airmotes,
i malign the leaden perspective
of identical gray brick houses,
orange rooftiles, orange chimney pots,
and see that first house, as if between
mirrors, engendering a spectral
corridor of inane replicas,
flimsily peopled
but landowners
own their cabbage roots, a space of stars,
indigenous peace such substance makes
my eyeful of reflections a ghosts
eyeful, which, envious, would define
death as striking root on one landtract
life, its own vaporous wayfarings
ella mason and her eleven cats
old ella mason keeps cats, eleven at last count,
in her ramshackle house off somerset terrace
people make queries
on seeing our neighbors cathaunt,
saying somethings addled in a woman who accommodates
that many cats
rum and redfaced as a watermelon, her voice
long gone to wheeze and seed, ella mason
for no good reason
plays hostess to tabby, tom and increase,
with cream and chickengut feasting the palates
of finical cats
village stories go that in olden days
ella flounced about, minxthin and haughty,
a fashionable beauty,
slaying the dandies with her emerald eyes
now, run to fat, shes a spinster whose door shuts
on all but cats
once we children sneaked over to spy miss mason
napping in her kitchen paved with saucers
on antimacassars
tabletop, cupboard shelf, cats lounged brazen,
one grufftimbred purr rolling from furred throats
such stentorian cats
with poke and giggle, ready to skedaddle,
we peered agog through the cobwebbed door
straight into yellow glare
of guardian cats crouched round their idol,
while ella drowsed whiskered with sleek face, sly wits
sphinxqueen of cats
look there she goes, catlady mason
we snickered as she shambled down somerset terrace
to market for her dearies,
more mammoth and blowsy with every season
miss ellas got loony from keeping in cahoots
with eleven cats
but now turned kinder with time, we mark miss mason
blinking greeneyed and solitary
at girls who marry
demure ones, lithe ones, needing no lesson
that vain jades sulk single down bridal nights,
accurst as wildcats

crystal gazer
gerd sits spindleshanked in her dark tent,
lean face gone tawn with seasons,
skin worn down to the knucklebones
at her tough trade without times taint
the burnished ball hangs fire in her hands, a lens
fusing times three horizons
two enter to tap her sight, a green pair
fresh leaved out in vows come tell
how we shall do together,
well or ill gerd slants a look at each most dear,
each to the other fit fiber for stern weather
slowly she spins the ball
i see two stalwart apple trees
coupled by branches intertwined
and, springing all about,
staunch saplings to this house, thriving days
will bring crops increase, and harvest fruit
follow on kind wind
no hardship then ? he asks well take
whatever trials to come, so say true
his bride echoes his word at that,
gerd whirls the ball ablaze rough storm, she grants, may wreak
some havoc on tender limb, and yet
strengthen that orchard thereby
their small price paid, these wedded ones
walk forth into sunmoneyed air, quickened
to savor their span of flourishing
aloof, squatting mummywise, gerd scans
that clairvoyant quartz which once, at her own wishing,
exacted her first simple sight for this strict second
then, a freegadding hoyden, gerd had craved
to govern more sight than given to a woman
by wits alone to foresee her lovers faith
and their future lot, she braved
church curse to ken that crooked oath
whereby one hires a demon
a flash like doomcrack rent nights black
gods work stood anchored in that glare
focusing all times daysuns in one
so beggar gerd might aim her look
at gorgonprospects with power to strike to stone
hearts of those who pierced times core
i
what gerd saw then engraved her mind
plaguepitted as the moon each bud
shriveling to cinders at its source,
each love blazing blind to its gutted end
and, fixed in the crystal center, grinning fierce
earths evergreen deaths head

november graveyard
the scene stands stubborn skinflint trees
hoard last years leaves, wont mourn, wear sackcloth, or turn
to elegiac dryads, and dour grass
guards the hardhearted emerald of its grassiness
however the grandiloquent mind may scorn
such poverty no dead mens cries
flower forgetmenots between the stones
paving this grave ground heres honest rot
to unpick the heart, pare bone
free of the fictive vein when one stark skeleton
bulks real, all saints tongues fall quiet
flies watch no resurrections in the sun
at the essential landscape stare, stare
till your eyes foist a vision dazzling on the wind
whatever lost ghosts flare,
damned, howling in their shrouds across the moor
rave on the leash of the starving mind
which peoples the bare room, the blank, untenanted air

black rook in rainy w e a t h e r
on the stiff twig up there
hunches a wet black rook
arranging and rearranging its feathers in the rain
i do not expect a miracle
or an accident
i
to set the sight on fire
in my eye, nor seek
any more in the desultory weather some design,
but let spotted leaves fall as they fall,
without ceremony, or portent
although, i admit, i desire,
occasionally, some backtalk
from the mute sky, i cant honestly complain
a certain minor light may still
lean incandescent
out of kitchen table or chair
as if a celestial burning took
possession of the most obtuse objects now and then
thus hallowing an interval
otherwise inconsequent
by bestowing largesse, honor,
one might say love at any rate, i now walk
wary for it could happen
even in this dull, ruinous landscape skeptical,
yet politic ignorant
of whatever angel may choose to flare
suddenly at my elbow i only know that a rook
ordering its black feathers can so shine
as to seize my senses, haul
my eyelids up, and grant
a brief respite from fear
of total neutrality with luck,
trekking stubborn through this season
of fatigue, i shall
patch together a content
of sorts miracles occur,
if you care to call those spasmodic
tricks of radiance miracles the waits begun again,
the long wait for the angel,
for that rare, random descent

the snowman on the moor
stalemated their armies stood, with tottering banners
she flung from a room
still ringing with bruit of insults and dishonors
and in fury left him
glowering at the coalfire come find me her last taunt
he did not come
but sat on, guarding his grim battlement
by the doorstep
her winterbeheaded daisies, marrowless, gaunt,
warned her to keep
indoors with politic goodwill, not haste
into a landscape
of stark windharrowed hills and weltering mist
but from the house
she stalked intractable as a driven ghost
across moor snows
pocked by rookclaw and rabbittrack she must yet win
him to his knees
let him send police and hounds to bring her in
nursing her rage
through bare whistling heather, over stiles of black stone,

to the worlds white edge
she came, and called hell to subdue an unruly man
and join her siege
it was no fireblurting forktailed demon
volcanoed hot
from marble snowheap of moor to ride that woman
with spur and knout
down from prides size instead, a grislythewed,
austere, corpsewhite
giant heaved into the distance, stonehatcheted,
skyhigh, and snow
floured his whirling beard, and at his tread
ambushed birds by
dozens dropped dead in the hedges o she felt
no love in his eye,
worsesaw dangling from that spikestudded belt
ladies sheaved skulls
mournfully the dry tongues clacked their guilt
our wit made fools
of kings, unmanned kings sons our masteries
amused court halls
for that brag, we barnacle these iron thighs
throned in the thick
of a blizzard, the giant roared up with his chittering trophies
from brunt of axecrack
she shied sideways a white fizz and the giant, pursuing,
crumbled to smoke
humbled then, and crying,
the girl bent homeward, brimful of gentle talk
and mild obeying

mayflower
throughout black winter the red haws withstood
assault of snowflawed winds from the dour skies
and, bright as blooddrops, proved no brave branch dies
if roots firmfixed and resolution good
now, as green sap ascends the steepled wood,
each hedge with such white bloom astounds our eyes
as sprang from josephs rod, and testifies
how best beautys born of hardihood
so when staunch island stock chose forfeiture
of the homeland hearth to plough their pilgrim way
across atlantic furrows, dark, unsure
remembering the white, triumphant spray
on hawthorn boughs, with goodwill to endure
they named their ship after the flower of may
sow
god knows how our neighbor managed to breed
his great sow
whatever his shrewd secret, he kept it hid
in the same way
he kept the sowimpounded from public stare,
prize ribbon and pig show
but one dusk our questions commended us to a tour
through his lanternlit
maze of barns to the lintel of the sunk sty door
to gape at it
this was no roseandlarkspurred china suckling
with a penny slot
for thrifty children, nor dolt pig ripe for heckling,
about to be
glorified for prime flesh and golden crackling

in a parsley halo
nor even one of the common barnyard sows,
miresmirched, blowzy,
maunching thistle and knotweed on her snoutcruise
bloat tun of milk
on the move, hedged by a litter of featfoot ninnies
shrilling her hulk
to halt for a swig at the pink teats no this vast
brobdingnag bulk
of a sow lounged bellybedded on that black compost,
fatrutted eyes
dreamfilmed what a vision of ancient hoghood must
thus wholly engross
the great grandam our marvel blazoned a knight,
helmed, in cuirass,
unhorsed and shredded in the grove of combat
by a grislybristled
boar, fabulous enough to straddle that sows heat
but our farmer whistled,
then, with a jocular fist thwacked the barrel nape,
and the greencopsecastled
pig hove, letting legend like dried mud drop,
slowly, grunt
on grunt, up in the flickering light to shape
a monument
prodigious in gluttonies as that hog whose want
made lean lent
of kitchen slops and, stomaching no constraint,
proceeded to swill
the seven troughed seas and every earthquaking continent

the everlasting monday
thou shalt have an everlasting
monday and stand in the moon
the moons man stands in his shell,
bent under a bundle
of sticks the light falls chalk and cold
upon our bedspread
his teeth are chattering among the leprous
peaks and craters of those extinct volcanoes
he also against black frost
would pick sticks, would not rest
until his own lit room outshone
sundays ghost of sun
now works his hell of mondays in the moons
fireless, seven chill seas chained to his ankle
hardcastle crags
flintlike, her feet struck
such a racket of echoes from the steely street,
tacking in moonblued crooks from the black
stonebuilt town, that she heard the quick air ignite
its tinder and shake
a firework of echoes from wall
to wall of the dark, dwarfed cottages
but the echoes died at her back as the walls
gave way to fields and the incessant seethe of grasses
riding in the full
of the moon, manes to the wind,
tireless, tied, as a moonbound sea
moves on its root though a mistwraith wound
up from the fissured valley and hung shoulderhigh
ahead, it fattened

to no familyfeatured ghost,
nor did any word body with a name
the blank mood she walked in once past
the dreampeopled village, her eyes entertained no dream,
and the sandmans dust
lost lustre under her footsoles
the long wind, paring her person down
to a pinch of flame, blew its burdened whistle
in the whorl of her ear, and like a scoopedout pumpkin crown
her head cupped the babel
all the night gave her, in return
for the paltry gift of her bulk and the beat
of her heart, was the humped indifferent iron
of its hills, and its pastures bordered by black stone set
on black stone barns
guarded broods and litters
behind shut doors the dairy herds
knelt in the meadow mute as boulders
sheep drowsed stoneward in their tussocks of wool, and birds,
twigsleeping, wore
granite ruffs, their shadows
the guise of leaves the whole landscape
loomed absolute as the antique world was
once, in its earliest sway of lymph and sap,
unaltered by eyes,
enough to snuff the quick
of her small heat out, but before the weight
of stones and hills of stones could break
her down to mere quartz grit in that stony light
she turned back

the thin people
they are always with us, the thin people
meager of dimension as the gray people
on a moviescreen they
are unreal, we say
it was only in a movie, it was only
in a war making evil headlines when we
were small that they famished and
grew so lean and would not round
out their stalky limbs again though peace
plumped the bellies of the mice
under the meanest table
it was during the long hungerbattle
they found their talent to persevere
in thinness, to come, later,
into our bad dreams, their menace
not guns, not abuses,
but a thin silence
wrapped in flearidden donkey skins,
empty of complaint, forever
drinking vinegar from tin cups they wore
the insufferable nimbus of the lotdrawn
scapegoat but so thin,
so weedy a race could not remain in dreams,
could not remain outlandish victims
in the contracted country of the head
any more than the old woman in her mud hut could

keep from cutting fat meat
out of the side of the generous moon when it
set foot nightly in her yard
until her knife had pared
the moon to a rind of little light
now the thin people do not obliterate
themselves as the dawn
grayness blues, reddens, and the outline
of the world comes clear and fills with color
they persist in the sunlit room the wallpaper
frieze of cabbageroses and cornflowers pales
under their thinlipped smiles,
their withering kingship
how they prop each other up
we own no wildernesses rich and deep enough
for stronghold against their stiff
battalions see, how the tree boles flatten
and lose their good browns
if the thin people simply stand in the forest,
making the world go thin as a wasps nest
and grayer not even moving their bones

on the difficulty of conjuring up
a dryad
ravening through the persistent bricabrac
of blunt pencils, rosesprigged coffee cup,
postage stamps, stacked books clamor and yawp,

neighborhood cockcrowall natures prodigal backtalk,
the vaunting mind
snubs impromptu spiels of wind
and wrestles to impose
its own order on what is
with my fantasy alone, brags the importunate head,
arrogant among rooktongued spaces,
sheep greens, finned falls, i shall compose a crisis
to stun sky black out, drive gibbering mad
trout, cock, ram,
that bulk so calm
on my jealous stare,
selfsufficient as they are
but no hocuspocus of green angels
damasks with dazzle the threadbare eye
my trouble, doctor, is i see a tree,
and that damn scrupulous tree wont practice wiles
to beguile sight
eg, by cant of light
concoct a daphne
my tree stays tree
however i wrench obstinate bark and trunk
to my sweet will, no luminous shape
steps out radiant in limb, eye, lip,
to hoodwink the honest earth which pointblank
spurns such fiction
as nymphs cold vision
will have no counterfeit
palmed off on it
no doubt now in dreampropertied fall some mooneyed,
starlucky sleightofhand man watches
my jilting lady squander coin, gold leaf stock ditches,
and the opulent air go studded with seed,
while this beggared brain
hatches no fortune,
but from leaf, from grass,
thieves what it has

on the plethora of dryads
hearing a white saint rave
about a quintessential beauty
visible only to the paragon heart,
i tried my sight on an appletree
that for eccentric knob and wart
had all my love
without meat or drink i sat
starving my fantasy down
to discover that metaphysical tree which hid
from my worldling look its brilliant vein
far deeper in gross wood
than axe could cut
but before i might blind sense
to see with the spotless soul,
each particular quirk so ravished me
every pock and stain bulked more beautiful
than flesh of any body
flawed by loves prints
battle however i would
to break through that patchwork
of leaves bicker and whisk in babel tongues,
streak and mottle of tawn bark,
no visionary lightnings
pierced my dense lid
instead, a wanton fit
dragged each dazzled sense apart
surfeiting eye, ear, taste, touch, smell
now, snared by this miraculous art,
i ride earths burning carrousel
day in, day out,
and such grit corrupts my eyes
i must watch sluttish dryads twitch

their multifarious silks in the holy grove
until no chaste tree but suffers blotch
under flux of those seductive
reds, greens, blues
the other two
all summer we moved in a villa brimful of echoes,
cool as the pearled interior of a conch
bells, hooves, of the highstepping black goats woke us
around our bed the baronial furniture
foundered through levels of light seagreen and strange
not one leaf wrinkled in the clearing air
we dreamed how we were perfect, and we were
against bare, whitewashed walls, the furniture
anchored itself, griffinlegged and darkly grained
two of us in a place meant for ten more
our footsteps multiplied in the shadowy chambers,
our voices fathomed a profounder sound
the walnut banquet table, the twelve chairs
mirrored the intricate gestures of two others
heavy as statuary, shapes not ours
performed a dumbshow in the polished wood,
that cabinet without windows or doors
he lifts an arm to bring her close, but she
shies from his touch his is an iron mood
seeing her freeze, he turns his face away
they poise and grieve as in some old tragedy
moonblanched and implacable, he and she
would not be eased, released our each example
of tenderness dove through their purgatory
like a planet, a stone, swallowed in a great darkness,
leaving no sparky track, setting up no ripple
nightly we left them in their desert place
lights out, they dogged us, sleepless and envious

we dreamed their arguments, their stricken voices
we might embrace, but those two never did,
come, so unlike us, to a stiff impasse,
burdened in such a way we seemed the lighter
ourselves the haunters, and they, flesh and blood
as if, above loves ruinage, we were
the heaven those two dreamed of, in despair
the lady and the earthenware head
fired in sanguine clay, the model head
fit nowhere brickdustcomplected, eye under a dense lid,
on the long bookshelf it stood
stolidly propping thick volumes of prose spiteset
ape of her look best rid
hearthstone at once of the outrageous head
still, she felt loath to junk it
no place, it seemed, for the effigy to fare
free from all molesting rough boys,
spying a pate to spare
glowering sullen and pompous from an ashheap,
might well seize this prize,
maltreat the hostage head in shocking wise,
and waken the sly nerve up
that knits to each original its coarse copy a dark tarn
she thought of then, thicksilted, with weeds obscured,
to serve her exacting turn
but out of the watery aspic, laureled by fins,
the simulacrum leered,
lewdly beckoning, and her courage wavered
she blenched, as one who drowns,
and resolved more ceremoniously to lodge
the mimic headin a crotched willow, green
vaulted by foliage
let belltongued birds descant in blackest feather
on the rendering, grain by grain,

of that uncouth shape to simple sod again
through drear and dulcet weather
yet, shrined on her shelf, the grisly visage endured,
despite her wrung hands, her tears, her praying vanish
steadfast and evilstarred,
it ogled through rockfault, windflaw and fisted wave
an antique haghead, too tough for knife to finish,
refusing to diminish
by one jot its basilisklook of love

all the dead dears
in the archaeological museum in cambridge is a stone
coffin of the fourth century ad containing the skeletons
of a woman, a mouse and a shrew the anklebone of the
woman has been slightly gnawn
rigged pokerstiff on her back
with a granite grin
this antique museumcased lady
lies, companioned by the gimcrack
relics of a mouse and a shrew
that battened for a day on her anklebone
these three, unmasked now, bear
dry witness
to the gross eating game
wed wink at if we didnt hear
stars grinding, crumb by crumb,
our own grist down to its bony face
how they grip us through thin and thick,
these barnacle dead
this lady heres no kin
of mine, yet kin she is shell suck
blood and whistle my marrow clean
to prove it as i think now of her head,
from the mercurybacked glass
mother, grandmother, greatgrandmother
reach hag hands to haul me in,

and an image looms under the fishpond surface
where the daft father went down
with orange duckfeet winnowing his hair
all the long gone darlings they
get back, though, soon,
soon be it by wakes, weddings,
childbirths or a family barbecue
any touch, taste, tangs
fit for those outlaws to ride home on,
and to sanctuary usurping the armchair
between tick
and tack of the clock, until we go,
each skulledandcrossboned gulliver
riddled with ghosts, to lie
deadlocked with them, taking root as cradles rock
natural history
that lofty monarch, monarch mind,
blueblooded in coarse country reigned
though he bedded in ermine, gorged on roast,
pure philosophy his love engrossed
while subjects hungered, emptypursed,
with stars, with angels, he conversed
till, sick of their rulers godling airs,
in one body those earthborn commoners
rose up and put royal nerves to the rack
king egghead saw his domain crack,
his crown usurped by the low brow
of the base, barbarous prince ow
two views of withens
above whorled, spindling gorse,
sheepfootflattened grasses,
stone wall and ridgepole rise
i
prowlike through blurs
of fog in that hinterland few
hikers get to
home of uncatchable
sage hen and spry rabbit,
where second wind, hip boot
help over hill
and hill, and through peaty water
i found bare moor,
a colorless weather,
and the house of eros
lowlintelled, no palace
you, luckier,
report white pillars, a blue sky,
the ghosts, kindly
the great carbuncle
we came over the moortop
through air streaming and greenlit,
stone farms foundering in it,
valleys of grass altering
in a light neither of dawn
nor nightfall, our hands, faces
lucent as porcelain, the earths
claim and weight gone out of them
some such transfiguring moved
the eight pilgrims towards its source
toward that great jewel shown often,
never given hidden, yet
simultaneously seen
on moortop, at seabottom,
knowable only by light
other than noon, than moon, stars
the onceknown way becoming

wholly other, and ourselves
estranged, changed, suspended where
angels are rumored, clearly
floating, among the floating
tables and chairs gravitys
lost in the lift and drift of
an easier element
than earth, and there is nothing
so fine we cannot do it
but nearing means distancing
at the common homecoming
light withdraws chairs, tables drop
down the body weighs like stone
words for a nursery
rosebud, knot of worms,
heir of the first five
shapers, i open
five moony crescents
for eyes to light me
toward what i can grab,
milkspout, big finger
so many ladders
giving a leg up
to these limber hooks
i learn, good circus
dog that i am, how
to move, serve, steer food,
index the arrow,
thumbhead, blunt helper,
my masters fetcher,
whipper of itches,
no pocket dozer,
i shut on the key
of this bluegreen toy

fiveantlered, branching
touchy antenna,
i nose out the lay
of thistle and silk,
cold pole and hot plate
old historian,
my page this desert
crossed by three causeways,
leathery, treeless,
with five whorled landspits
brownbacked, whitebellied
as a flatfish, i
swim the sea of do,
the left my lackey,
my backward image
penbearer, scrubnurse,
the captains batman,
by heart here i hold
coin, button, trigger
and his loves body
illserved hell be when
age manhandles me
a crab to nap on
chairarms and tables,
five wickless candles
to wag at the dark
and worseserved when death
makes off with this rose,
five worms in a box
to feed the thin crows

t h e disquieting muses
mother, mother, what illbred aunt
or what disfigured and unsightly
cousin did you so unwisely keep
unasked to my christening, that she
sent these ladies in her stead

with heads like darningeggs to nod
and nod and nod at foot and head
and at the left side of my crib ?
mother, who made to order stories
of mixie blackshort the heroic bear,
mother, whose witches always, always
got baked into gingerbread, i wonder
whether you saw them, whether you said
words to rid me of those three ladies
nodding by night around my bed,
mouthless, eyeless, with stitched bald head
in the hurricane, when fathers twelve
study windows bellied in
like bubbles about to break, you fed
my brother and me cookies and ovaltine
and helped the two of us to choir
thor is angry boom boom boom
thor is angry we dont care
but those ladies broke the panes
when on tiptoe the schoolgirls danced,
blinking flashlights like fireflies
and singing the glowworm song, i could
not lift a foot in the twinkledress
but, heavyfooted, stood aside
in the shadow cast by my dismalheaded
godmothers, and you cried and cried
and the shadow stretched, the lights went out
mother, you sent me to piano lessons
and praised my arabesques and trills
although each teacher found my touch
oddly wooden in spite of scales
and the hours of practicing, my ear
tonedeaf and yes, unteachable
i learned, i learned, i learned elsewhere,
from muses unhired by you, dear mother
i woke one day to see you, mother,
floating above me in bluest air

on a green balloon bright with a million
flowers and bluebirds that never were
never, never, found anywhere
but the little planet bobbed away
like a soapbubble as you called come here
and i faced my traveling companions
day now, night now, at head, side, feet,
they stand their vigil in gowns of stone,
faces blank as the day i was born,
their shadows long in the setting sun
that never brightens or goes down
and this is the kingdom you bore me to,
mother, mother but no frown of mine
will betray the company i keep

night shift
it was not a heart, beating,
that muted boom, that clangor
far off, not blood in the ears
drumming up any fever
to impose on the evening
the noise came from outside
a metal detonating
native, evidently, to
these stilled suburbs nobody
startled at it, though the sound
shook the ground with its pounding
it took root at my coming
till the thudding source, exposed,
confounded inept guesswork
framed in windows of main streets
silver factory, immense
hammers hoisted, wheels turning,
stalled, let fall their vertical

tonnage of metal and wood
stunned the marrow men in white
undershirts circled, tending
without stop those greased machines,
tending, without stop, the blunt
indefatigable fact

ouija
it is a chilly god, a god of shades,
rises to the glass from his black fathoms
at the window, those unborn, those undone
assemble with the frail paleness of moths,
an envious phosphorescence in their wings
vermilions, bronzes, colors of the sun
in the coal fire will not wholly console them
imagine their deep hunger, deep as the dark
for the bloodheat that would ruddle or reclaim
the glass mouth sucks bloodheat from my forefinger
the old god dribbles, in return, his words
the old god, too, writes aureate poetry
in tarnished modes, maundering among the wastes,
fair chronicler of every foul declension
age, and ages of prose, have uncoiled
his talking whirlwind, abated his excessive temper
when words, like locusts, drummed the darkening air
and left the cobs to rattle, bitten clean
skies once wearing a blue, divine hauteur
ravel above us, mistily descend,
thickening with motes, to a marriage with the mire
he hymns the rotten queen with saffron hair
who has saltier aphrodisiacs
than virgins tears that bawdy queen of death,
her wormy couriers are at his bones
still he hymns juice of her, hot nectarine
i see him, hornyskinned and tough, construe
what flinty pebbles the ploughblade upturns
as ponderable tokens of her love
j
he, godly, doddering, spells
no succinct gabriel from the letters here
but floridly, his amorous nostalgias

on the decline of oracles
my father kept a vaulted conch
by two bronze bookends of ships in sail,
and as i listened its cold teeth seethed
with voices of that ambiguous sea
old bocklin missed, who held a shell
to hear the sea he could not hear
what the seashell spoke to his inner ear
he knew, but no peasants know
my father died, and when he died
he willed his books and shell away
the books burned up, sea took the shell,
but i, i keep the voices he
set in my ear, and in my eye
the sight of those blue, unseen waves
for which the ghost of bocklin grieves
the peasants feast and multiply
eclipsing the spitted ox i see
neither brazen swan nor burning star,
heraldry of a starker age,
but three men entering the yard,
and those men coming up the stair
profitless, their gossiping images
invade the cloistral eye like pages
from a gross comic strip, and toward
the happening of this happening
the earth turns now in half an hour
i shall go down the shabby stair and meet,
coming up, those three worth
less than present, pastthis future
worthless such vision to eyes gone dull
that once descried troys towers fall,
saw evil break out of the north


snakecharmer
as the gods began one world, and man another,
so the snakecharmer begins a snaky sphere
with mooneye, mouthpipe he pipes pipes green pipes water
pipes water green until green waters waver
with reedy lengths and necks and undulatings
and as his notes twine green, the green river
shapes its images around his songs
he pipes a place to stand on, but no rocks,
no floor a wave of flickering grass tongues
supports his foot he pipes a world of snakes,
of sways and coilings, from the snakerooted bottom
of his mind and now nothing but snakes
is visible the snakescales have become
leaf, become eyelid snakebodies, bough, breast
of tree and human and he within this snakedom
rules the writhings which make manifest
his snakehood and his might with pliant tunes
from his thin pipe out of this green nest
as out of edens navel twist the lines
of snaky generations let there be snakes
and snakes there were, are, will betill yawns
consume this piper and he tires of music
and pipes the world back to the simple fabric
of snakewarp, snakeweft pipes the cloth of snakes
to a melting of green waters, till no snake
shows its head, and those green waters back to
water, to green, to nothing like a snake
puts up his pipe, and lids his moony eye


a lesson in vengeance
in the dour ages
of drafty cells and draftier castles,
of dragons breathing without the frame of fables,
saint and king unfisted obstructions knuckles
by no miracle or majestic means,
but by such abuses
as smack of spite and the overscrupulous
twisting of thumbscrews one soul tied in sinews,
one white horse drowned, and all the unconquered pinnacles
of gods city and babylons
must wait, while here susos
hand hones his tacks and needles,
scourging to sores his own red sluices
for the relish of heaven, relentless, dousing with prickles
of horsehair and lice his horny loins
while there irate cyrus
squanders a summer and the brawn of his heroes
to rebuke the horseswallowing river gyndes
he split it into three hundred and sixty trickles
a girl could wade without wetting her shins
still, latterday sages,
smiling at this behavior, subjugating their enemies
neatly, nicely, by disbelief or bridges,
never grip, as their grandsires did, that devil who chuckles
from grain of the marrow and the riverbed grains


virgin in a tree
how this tart fable instructs
and mocks heres the parody of that moral mousetrap
set in the proverbs stitched on samplers
approving chased girls who get them to a tree
and put on barks nunblack
habit which deflects
all amorous arrows for to sheathe the virgin shape
in a scabbard of wood baffles pursuers,
whether goatthighed or godhaloed ever since that first daphne
switched her incomparable back
for a baytree hide, respects
twined to her hard limbs like ivy the puritan lip
cries celebrate syrinx whose demurs
won her the frogcolored skin, pale pith and watery
bed of a reed look
pineneedle armor protects
pitys from pans assault and though age drop
their leafy crowns, their fame soars,
eclipsing eva, cleo and helen of troy
for which of those would speak
for a fashion that constricts
white bodies in a wooden girdle, root to top
unfaced, unformed, the nippleflowers
shrouded to suckle darkness ? only they
who keep cool and holy make

a sanctum to attract
green virgins, consecrating limb and lip
to chastitys service like prophets, like preachers,
they descant on the serene and seraphic beauty
of virgins for virginitys sake
be certain some such pacts
been struck to keep all glory in the grip
of ugly spinsters and barren sirs
as you etch on the inner window of your eye
this virgin on her rack
she, ripe and unplucked, s
lain splayed too long in the tortuous boughs overripe
now, dourfaced, her fingers
stiff as twigs, her body woodenly
askew, shell ache and wake
though doomsday bud neglects
given her lips that lemontasting droop
untongued, all beautys bright juice sours
treetwist will ape this gross anatomy
till ironys bough break

perseus
t h e t r i u m p h of wit over suffering
head alone shows you in the prodigious act
of digesting what centuries alone digest
the mammoth, lumbering statuary of sorrow,
indissoluble enough to riddle the guts
of a whale with holes and holes, and bleed him white
into salt seas hercules had a simple time,
rinsing those stables a babys tears would do it
but whod volunteer to gulp the laocoon,
the dying gaul and those innumerable pietas
festering on the dim walls of europes chapels,
museums and sepulchers? you

you
who borrowed feathers for your feet, not lead,
not nails, and a mirror to keep the snaky head
in safe perspective, could outface the gorgongrimace
of human agony a look to numb
limbs not a basiliskblink, nor a double whammy,
but all the accumulated last grunts, groans,
cries and heroic couplets concluding the million
enacted tragedies on these bloodsoaked boards,
and every private twinge a hissing asp
to petrify your eyes, and every village
catastrophe a writhing length of cobra,
and the decline of empires the thick coil of a vast
anaconda
imagine the world
fisted to a foetus head, ravined, seamed
with suffering from conception upwards, and there
you have it in hand grit in the eye or a sore
thumb can make anyone wince, but the whole globe
expressive of grief turns gods, like kings, to rocks
those rocks, cleft and worn, themselves then grow
ponderous and extend despair on earths
dark face
so might rigor mortis come to stiffen
all creation, were it not for a bigger belly
still than swallows joy
you enter now,
armed with feathers to tickle as well as fly,
and a funhouse mirror that turns the tragic muse
to the beheaded head of a sullen doll, one braid,
a bedraggled snake, hanging limp as the absurd mouth
hangs in its lugubrious pout where are
the classic limbs of stubborn antigone ?
the red, royal robes of phedre? the teardazzled
sorrows of malfis gentle duchess ?
gone
in the deep convulsion gripping your face, muscles
and sinews bunched, victorious, as the cosmic
laugh does away with the unstitching, plaguey wounds
of an eternal sufferer

to you
perseus, the palm, and may you poise
and repoise until time stop, the celestial balance
which weighs our madness with our sanity

yadwigha, on a red couch,
a m o n g lilies
a sestina for the douanier
yadwigha, the literalists once wondered how you
came to be lying on this baroque couch
upholstered in red velvet, under the eye
of uncaged tigers and a tropical moon,
set in an intricate wilderness of green
heartshaped leaves, like catalpa leaves, and lilies
of monstrous size, like no wellbred lilies
it seems the consistent critics wanted you
to choose between your world of jungle green
and the fashionable monde of the red couch
with its prim bricabrac, without a moon
to turn you luminous, without the eye
of tigers to be stilled by your dark eye
and body whiter than its frill of lilies
theyd have had yellow silk screening the moon,
leaves and lilies flattened to paper behind you
or, at most, to a millefleurs tapestry but the couch
stood stubborn in its jungle red against green,
red against fifty variants of green,
the couch glared out at the prosaic eye

so rousseau, to explain why the red couch
persisted in the picture with the lilies,
tigers, snakes, and the snakecharmer and you,
and birds of paradise, and the round moon,
described how you fell dreaming at full of moon
on a red velvet couch within your green
tessellated boudoir hearing flutes, you
dreamed yourself away in the moons eye
to a beryl jungle, and dreamed that bright moonlilies
nodded their petaled heads around your couch
and that, rousseau told the critics, was why the couch
accompanied you so they nodded at the couch with the moon
and the snakecharmers song and the gigantic lilies,
marvelingly numbered the many shades of green
but to a friend, in private, rousseau confessed his eye
so possessed by the glowing red of the couch which you,
yadwigha, pose on, that he put you on the couch
to feed his eye with red such red under the moon,
in the midst of all that green and those great lilies

frostbitten pigeons, eddy forth

from south station to north

above the oxbow
here in this valley of discreet academies
we have not mountains, but mounts, truncated hillocks
t o the adirondacks, to northern monadnock,
themselves mere rocky hillocks to an everest

still, theyre our best mustering of height by
comparison with the sunken silvergrizzled
back of the connecticut, the riverlevel
flats of hadley farms, theyre lofty enough
elevations to be called something more than hills
green, wholly green, they stand their knobby spine
against our sky they are what we look southward to
up pleasant street at main poising their shapes
between the snuff and red tarpaper apartments,
they mound a summer coolness in our view
to people who live in the bottom of valleys
a rise in the landscape, hummock or hogback, looks
to be meant for climbing a peculiar logic
in going up for the coming down if the post
we start ats the same post we finish by,
but its the clear conversion at the top can hold
us to the oblique road, in spite of a fitful
wish for even ground, and its the last cliff
ledge will dislodge our cramped concept of space, unwall
horizons beyond vision, spill vision
after the horizons, stretching the narrowed eye
to full capacity we climb in hopes
of such seeing up the leafshuttered escarpments,
blindered by green, under a greengrained sky
into the blue tops define themselves as places
where nothing highers to be looked to downward looks
follow the black arrowbacks of swifts on their track
of the air eddies loop and arc though airs at rest

hundredyearold hotel sustains its ramshackle
fourway veranda, viewkeeping above
the fallen timbers of its once remarkable
funicular railway, witness to gone
time, and to graces gone with the time a state view

and paints the rivers pale circumfluent stillness
as roses broach their carmine in a mirror flux

by correct green lines and no seedy freeforall
of asparagus heads cars run their suave
colored beads on the strung roads, and the people stroll
straightforwardly across the springing green
alls peace and discipline down there till lately we
lived under the shadow of hot rooftops
and never saw how coolly we might move for once
a high hush quietens the crickets cry
memoirs of a spinachpicker
they called the place lookout farm
back then, the sun
didnt go down in such a hurry how it
lit things, that lamp of the possible
wet yet
lay over the leaves like a clear cellophane,
a pane of dragonfly wing, when they left me
with a hundred bushel baskets on the edge
of the spinach patch
bunch after bunch of green
upstanding spinachtips wedged in a circle
layer on layer, and you had a basket
irreproachable as any lettuce head,
pure leafage a hundred baskets by days end
sun and sky mirrored the green of the spinach
in the tin pail shaded by yellow paper
wellwater kept cool at the start of the rows
the water had an iron taste, and the air,
even, a tang of metal
day in, day out,
i bent over the plants in my leatherkneed

dungarees, proud as a lady in a sea
of prize roses, culling the fullest florets
my world pyramided with laden baskets
id only to set one foot in wilderness
a whole sea of spinachheads leaned to my hand
the ghosts leavetaking
enter the chilly nomans land of about
five oclock in the morning, the nocolor void
where the waking head rubbishes out the draggled lot
of sulfurous dreamscapes and obscure lunar conundrums
which seemed, when dreamed, to mean so profoundly much,
gets ready to face the readymade creation
of chairs and bureaus and sleeptwisted sheets
this is the kingdom of the fading apparition,
the oracular ghost who dwindles on pinlegs
to a knot of laundry, with a classic bunch of sheets
upraised, as a hand, emblematic of farewell
at this joint between two worlds and two entirely
incompatible modes of time, the raw material
of our meatandpotato thoughts assumes the nimbus
of ambrosial revelation and so departs
chair and bureau are the hieroglyphs
of some godly utterance wakened heads ignore
so these posed sheets, before they thin to nothing,
speak in sign language of a lost otherworld,
a world we lose by merely waking up
trailing its telltale tatters only at the outermost
fringe of mundane vision, this ghost goes
hand aloft, goodbye, goodbye, not down
into the rocky gizzard of the earth,
but toward a region where our thick atmosphere

diminishes, and god knows what is there
a point of exclamation marks that sky
in ringing orange like a stellar carrot
its round period, displaced and green,
suspends beside it the first point, the starting
point of eden, next the new moons curve
go, ghost of our mother and father, ghost of us,
and ghost of our dreams children, in those sheets
which signify our origin and end,
to the cloudcuckoo land of color wheels
and pristine alphabets and cows that moo
and moo as they jump over moons as new
as that crisp cusp towards which you voyage now
hail and farewell hello, goodbye o keeper
of the profane grail, the dreaming skull

vision, wisdom, for bodies

than priests hands, invoke no vain
images of light and air
but sure stations in bronze, wood, stone
obdurate, in densegrained wood,
a bald angel blocks and shapes

them life livelier than ours,

full fathom five
old man, you surface seldom
then you come in with the tides coming
when seas wash cold, foam
capped  white hair, white beard, farflung,
a dragnet, rising, falling, as waves
crest and trough miles long
extend the radial sheaves
of your spread hair, in which wrinkling skeins
knotted, caught, survives
the old myth of origins
unimaginable you float near
as keeled icemountains
of the north, to be steered clear
of, not fathomed all obscurity
starts with a danger
your dangers are many i
cannot look much but your form suffers
some strange injury

and seems to die so vapors
ravel to clearness on the dawn sea
the muddy rumors
of your burial move me
to halfbelieve your reappearance
proves rumors shallow,
for the archaic trenched lines
of your grained face shed time in runnels
ages beat like rains
on the unbeaten channels
of the ocean such sage humor and
durance are whirlpools
to make away with the ground
work of the earth and the skys ridgepole
waist down, you may wind
one labyrinthine tangle
to root deep among knuckles, shinbones,
skulls inscrutable,
below shoulders not once
seen by any man who kept his head,
you defy questions
you defy other godhood
i walk dry on your kingdoms border
exiled to no good
your shelled bed i remember
father, this thick air is murderous
i would breathe water


lorelei
it is no night to drown in
a full moon, river lapsing
black beneath bland mirrorsheen,
the blue watermists dropping
scrim after scrim like fishnets
though fishermen are sleeping,
the massive castle turrets
doubling themselves in a glass
all stillness yet these shapes float
up toward me, troubling the face
of quiet from the nadir
they rise, their limbs ponderous
with richness, hair heavier
than sculpted marble they sing
of a world more full and clear
than can be sisters, your song
bears a burden too weighty
for the whorled ears listening
here, in a wellsteered country,
under a balanced ruler
deranging by harmony
beyond the mundane order,
your voices lay siege you lodge
on the pitched reefs of nightmare,
promising sure harborage
by day, descant from borders
of hebetude, from the ledge
also of high windows worse
even than your maddening
song, your silence at the source

of your icehearted calling
drunkenness of the great depths
o river, i see drifting
deep in your flux of silver
those great goddesses of peace
stone, stone, ferry me down there
mussel hunter at rock harbor
i came before the water
colorists came to get the
good of the cape light that scours
sand grit to sided crystal
and buffs and sleeks the blunt hulls
of the three fishing smacks beached
on the bank of the rivers
backtracking tail id come for
free fishbait the blue mussels
clumped like bulbs at the grassroot
margin of the tidal pools
dawn tide stood dead low i smelt
mud stench, shell guts, gulls leavings
heard a queer crusty scrabble
cease, and i neared the silenced
edge of a cratered poolbed
the mussels hung dull blue and
conspicuous, yet it seemed
a sly worlds hinges had swung
shut against me all held still
though i counted scant seconds,
enough ages lapsed to win
confidence of safeconduct

in the wary otherworld
eyeing me grass put forth claws
small mud knobs, nudged from under,
displaced their domes as tiny
knights might doff their casques the crabs
inched from their pigmy burrows
and from the trenchdug mud, all
camouflaged in mottled mail
of browns and greens each wore one
claw swollen to a shield large
as itselfno fiddlers arm
grown gargantuan by trade,
but grown grimly, and grimly
borne, for a use beyond my
guessing of it sibilant
massmotived hordes, they sidled
out in a converging stream
toward the poolmouth, perhaps to
meet the thin and sluggish thread
of sea retracing its tide
way up the riverbasin
or to avoid me they moved
obliquely with a drywet
sound, with a glittery wisp
and trickle could they feel mud
pleasurable under claws
as i could between bare toes ?
that question ended iti
stood shut out, for once, for all,
puzzling the passage of their
absolutely alien
order as i might puzzle
at the clear tail of halleys
comet coolly giving my
orbit the goby, made known
by a family name it

knew nothing of so the crabs
went about their business, which
wasnt fiddling, and i filled
a big handkerchief with blue
mussels from what the crabs saw,
if they could see, i was one
twolegged musselpicker
high on the airy thatching
of the dense grasses i found
the husk of a fiddlercrab,
intact, strangely strayed above
his world of mudgreen color
and innards bleached and blown off
somewhere by much sun and wind
there was no telling if hed
died recluse or suicide
or headstrong columbus crab
the crabface, etched and set there,
grimaced as skulls grimace it
had an oriental look,
a samurai death mask done
on a tiger tooth, less for
arts sake than gods far from sea
where redfreckled crabbacks, claws
and whole crabs, dead, their soggy
bellies pallid and upturned,
perform their shambling waltzes
on the waves dissolving turn
and return, losing themselves
bit by bit to their friendly
elementthis relic saved
face, to face the baldfaced sun

moonrise
grubwhite mulberries redden among leaves
ill go out and sit in white like they do,
doing nothing julys juice rounds their nubs
this park is fleshed with idiot petals
white catalpa flowers tower, topple,
cast a round white shadow in their dying
a pigeon rudders down its fantails white
vocation enough opening, shutting
white petals, white fantails, ten white fingers
enough for fingernails to make halfmoons
redden in white palms no labor reddens
white bruises toward color, else collapses
berries redden a body of whiteness
rots, and smells of rot under its headstone
though the body walk out in clean linen
i smell that whiteness here, beneath the stones
where small ants roll their eggs, where grubs fatten
death may whiten in sun or out of it
death whitens in the egg and out of it
i can see no color for this whiteness
white it is a complexion of the mind
i tire, imagining white niagaras
build up from a rock root, as fountains build
against the weighty image of their fall
lucina, bony mother, laboring
among the socketed white stars, your face
of candor pares white flesh to the white bone,
who drag our ancient father at the heel,
whitebearded, weary the berries purple
and bleed the white stomach may ripen yet

frog autumn
summer grows old, coldblooded mother
the insects are scant, skinny
in these palustral homes we only
croak and wither
mornings dissipate in somnolence
the sun brightens tardily
among the pithless reeds flies fail us
the fen sickens
frost drops even the spider clearly
the genius of plenitude
houses himself elsewhere our folk thin
lamentably
in midas country
meadows of gold dust the silver
currents of the connecticut fan
and meander in bland pleatings under
riververge farms where ryeheads whiten
alls polished to a dull luster
in the sulfurous noon we move
with the languor of idols below
the skys great bell glass and briefly engrave
our limbs image on a field of straw
and goldenrod as on gold leaf
it might be heaven, this static
plenitude apples gold on the bough,
goldfinch, goldfish, golden tiger cat stock
still in one gigantic tapestry
and lovers affable, dovelike
but now the waterskiers race,
bracing their knees on unseen towlines

they cleave the rivers greening patinas
the mirror quivers to smithereens
they stunt like clowns in the circus
so we are hauled, though we would stop
on this amber bank where grasses bleach
already the farmers after his crop,
august gives over its midas touch,
wind bares a flintier landscape
incommunicado
the groundhog on the mountain did not run
but fatly scuttled into the splayed fern
and faced me, back to a ledge of dirt, to rattle
her sallow rodent teeth like castanets
against my leaning down, would not exchange
for that wary clatter sound or gesture
of love claws braced, at bay, my currency not hers
such meetings never occur in marchen
where lovemet groundhogs love one in return,
where straight talk is the rule, whether warm or hostile,
which no gruff animal misinterprets
from what grace am i fallen tongues are strange,
signs say nothing the falcon who spoke clear
to canacee cries gibberish to coarsened ears
childs park stones
in sunless air, under pines
green to the point of blackness, some
founding father set these lobed, warped stones
to loom in the leaffiltered gloom
black as the charred knucklebones
ioo
of a giant or extinct
animal, come from another
age, another planet surely flanked
by the orange and fuchsia bonfire
of azaleas, sacrosanct
these stones guard a dark repose
and keep their shapes intact while sun
alters shadows of rose and iris
long, short, longin the lit garden
and kindles a daysend blaze
colored to dull the pigment
of the azaleas, yet burnt out
quick as they to follow the lights tint
and intensity by midnight
by noon and throughout the brunt
of various weathers is
to know the still heart of the stcnes
stones that take the whole summer to lose
their dream of the winters cold stones
warming at core only as
frost forms no mans crowbar could
uproot them their beards are ever
green nor do they, once in a hundred
years, go down to drink the river
no thirst disturbs a stones bed

owl
clocks belled twelve main street showed otherwise
than its suburb of woods nimbus
lit, but unpeopled, held its windows
of wedding pastries,
diamond rings, potted roses, foxskins
ruddy on the wax mannequins

in a glassed tableau of affluence
from deepsunk basements
what moved the pale, raptorial owl
then, to squall above the level
of streetlights and wires, its wall to wall
wingspread in control
of the ferrying currents, belly
densefeathered, fearfully soft to
look upon ? rats teeth gut the city

whiteness i remember
whiteness being what i remember
about sam whiteness and the great run
he gave me ive gone nowhere since but
goings been tame deviation white,
not of heraldic stallions offwhite
of the stable horse whose historys
humdrum, unexceptionable, his
tried sobriety hiring him out
to novices and to the timid
yet the dapple toning his white down
to safe gray never grayed his temper
i see him onetracked, stubborn, white horse,
first horse under me, high as the roofs,
his neat trot pitching my tense poise up,
unsettling the steadyrooted green
of country hedgerows and cow pastures
to a giddy jog then for ill will
or to try me he suddenly set
green grass streaming, houses a river
of pale fronts, straw thatchings, the hard road
an anvil, hooves four hammers to jolt
me off into their space of beating,

stirrups undone, and decorum and
wouldnt slow for the hauled reins, his name,
or shouts of walkers crossroad traffic
stalling curbside at his oncoming,
the world subdued to his run of it
i hung on his neck resoluteness
simplified me a rider, riding
hung out over hazard, over hooves
loud on earths bedrock almost thrown, not
thrown fear, wisdom, at one all colors
spinning to still in his one whiteness
july

fable of the rhododendron stealers
i walked the unwalked garden of rosebeds
in the public park at home felt the want
of a single rose present to imagine
the gardens remainder in full paint
the stone lionhead set in the wall
let drop its spittle of sluggish green
into the stone basin i snipped
an orange bud, pocketed it when
it had opened its orange in my vase,
retrogressed to blowze, i next chose red
argued my conscience clear which robbed
the park of less red than withering did
musk satisfied my nose, red my eye,
the petals nap my fingertips
i considered the poetry i rescued
from blind air, from complete eclipse
yet today, a yellow bud in my hand,
i stalled at sudden noisy crashes
from the laurel thicket no one approached
a spasm took the rhododendron bushes

three girls, engrossed, were wrenching full clusters
of cerise and pink from the rhododendron,
mountaining them on spread newspaper
they brassily picked, slowed by no chagrin,
and wouldnt pause for my straight look
but gave me pause, my rose a charge,
whether nicety stood confounded by love,
or petty thievery by large
the death of mythmaking
two virtues ride, by stallion, by nag,
to grind our knives and scissors
lanternjawed reason, squat common sense,
one courting doctors of all sorts,
one, housewives and shopkeepers
the trees are lopped, the poodles trim,
the laborers nails pared level
since those two civil servants set
their whetstone to the blunted edge
and minced the muddling devil
whose owleyes in the scraggly wood
scared mothers to miscarry,
drove the dogs to cringe and whine,
and turned the farmboys temper wolfish,
the housewifes, desultory
green rock, winthrop bay
no lame excuses can gloss over
bargetar clotted at the tideline, the wrecked pier
i should have known better

fifteen years between me and the bay
profited memory, but did away with the old scenery
and patched this shoddy
makeshift of a view to quit
my promise of an idyll, the blues worn out
its a niggard estate,
inimical now the great green rock
we gave good use as ship and house is black
with tarry muck
and periwinkles, shrunk to common
size the cries of scavenging gulls sound thin
in the traffic of planes
from logan airport opposite
gulls circle gray under shadow of a steelier flight
loss cancels profit
unless you do this tawdry harbor
a service and ignore it, i go a liar
gilding whats eyesore,
or must take loophole and blame time
for the rocks dwarfed lump, for the drabbled scum,
for a churlish welcome

t h e companionable ills
the noseend that twitches, the old imperfections
tolerable now as moles on the face
put up with until chagrin gives place
to a wry complaisance
dug in first as gods spurs
to start the spirit out of the mud
it stabled in longused, became wellloved
bedfellows of the spirits debauch, fond masters

i want, i want
openmouthed, the baby god
immense, bald, though babyheaded,
cried out for the mothers dug
the dry volcanoes cracked and spit,
sand abraded the milkless lip
cried then for the fathers blood
who set wasp, wolf and shark to work,
engineered the gannets beak
dryeyed, the inveterate patriarch
raised his men of skin and bone,
barbs on the crown of gilded wire,
thorns on the bloody rosestem
poems, potatoes
the word, defining, muzzles the drawn line
ousts mistier peers and thrives, murderous,
in establishments which imagined lines
can only haunt sturdy as potatoes,
stones, without conscience, word and line endure,
given an inch not that theyre gross although
afterthought often would have them alter
to delicacy, to poise but that they
shortchange me continuously whether
more or other, they still dissatisfy
unpoemed, unpictured, the potato
bunches its knobby browns on a vastly
superior page the blunt stone also

the times are tidy
unlucky the hero born
in this province of the stuck record
where the most watchful cooks go jobless
and the mayors rotisserie turns
round of its own accord
theres no career in the venture
of riding against the lizard,
himself withered these latterdays
to leafsize from lack of action
historys beaten the hazard
the last crone got burnt up
more than eight decades back
with the lovehot herb, the talking cat,
but the children are better for it,
the cow milks cream an inch thick

the bull of bendylaw
the black bull bellowed before the sea
the sea, till that day orderly,
hove up against bendylaw
the queen in the mulberry arbor stared
stiff as a queen on a playing card
the king fingered his beard
a blue sea, four horny bullfeet,
a bullsnouted sea that wouldnt stay put,
bucked at the garden gate
along boxlined walks in the florid sun
toward the rowdy bellow and back again
the lords and ladies ran
the great bronze gate began to crack,
the sea broke in at every crack,
pellmell, blueblack
the bull surged up, the bull surged down,
not to be stayed by a daisy chain
nor by any learned man
o the kings tidy acre is under the sea,
and the royal rose in the bulls belly,
and the bull on the kings highway

the eyemote
blameless as daylight i stood looking
at a field of horses, necks bent, manes blown,
tails streaming against the green
backdrop of sycamores sun was striking
while chapel pinnacles over the roofs,
holding the horses, the clouds, the leaves
steadily rooted though they were all flowing
away to the left like reeds in a sea
when the splinter flew in and stuck my eye,
needling it dark then i was seeing
a melding of shapes in a hot rain
horses warped on the altering green,
outlandish as doublehumped camels or unicorns,
grazing at the margins of a bad monochrome,
beasts of oasis, a better time
abrading my lid, the small grain burns
red cinder around which i myself,
horses, planets and spires revolve
neither tears nor the easing flush
of eyebaths can unseat the speck
it sticks, and it has stuck a week
i wear the present itch for flesh,
blind to what will be and what was
i dream that i am oedipus
what i want back is what i was
before the bed, before the knife,
before the broochpin and the salve
fixed me in this parenthesis
horses fluent in the wind,
a place, a time gone out of mind

point shirley
from watertower hill to the brick prison
the shingle booms, bickering under
the seas collapse
snowcakes break and welter this year
the gritted wave leaps
the seawall and drops onto a bier
of quahog chips,
leaving a salty mash of ice to whiten
in my grandmothers sand yard she is dead,
whose laundry snapped and froze here, who
kept house against
what the sluttish, rutted sea could do
squall waves once danced
ship timbers in through the cellar window
a threshtailed, lanced
shark littered in the geranium bed
such collusion of mulish elements
she wore her broom straws to the nub
twenty years out
of her hand, the house still hugs in each drab
stucco socket
the purple eggstones from great heads knob
to the filledin gut
the sea in its cold gizzard ground those rounds
nobody wintering now behind
the plankedup windows where she set
her wheat loaves
and apple cakes to cool what is it
survives, grieves
so, over this battered, obstinate spit
of gravel ? the waves
spewed relics clicker masses in the wind,
grey waves the stubnecked eiders ride
a labor of love, and that labor lost
steadily the sea
no
eats at point shirley she died blessed,
and i come by
bones, bones only, pawed and tossed,
a dogfaced sea
the sun sinks under boston, bloody red
i would get from these drypapped stones
the milk your love instilled in them
the black ducks dive
and though your graciousness might stream,
and i contrive,
grandmother, stones are nothing of home
to that spumiest dove
against both bar and tower the black sea runs
goatsucker
old goatherds swear how all night long they hear
the warning whirr and burring of the bird
who wakes with darkness and till dawn works hard
vampiring dry of milk each great goat udder
moon full, moon dark, the chary dairy farmer
dreams that his fattest cattle dwindle, fevered
by clawcuts of the goatsucker, alias devilbird,
its eye, flashlit, a chip of ruby fire
so fablis say the goatsucker moves, masked from mens sight
in an ebony air, on wings of witch cloth,
wellnamed, illfamed a knavish flybynight,
yet it never milked any goat, nor dealt cow death
and shadows onlycavemouth bristle beset
cockchafers and the wan, green luna moth
watercolor of grantchester meadows
there, spring lambs jam the sheepfold in air
stilled, silvered as water in a glass
nothing is big or far
i n
the small shrew chitters from its wilderness
of grassheads and is heard
each thumbsize bird
flits nimblewinged in thickets, and of good color
cloudwrack and owlhollowed willows slanting over
the bland granta double their white and green
world under the sheer water
and ride that flux at anchor, upside down
the punter sinks his pole
in byrons pool
cattails part where the tame cygnets steer
it is a country on a nursery plate
spotted cows revolve their jaws and crop
red clover or gnaw beetroot
bellied on a nimbus of sunglazed buttercup
hedging meadows of benign
arcadian green
the bloodberried hawthorn hides its spines with white
droll, vegetarian, the water rat
saws down a reed and swims from his limber grove,
while the students stroll or sit,
hands laced, in a moony indolence of love
blackgowned, but unaware
how in such mild air
the owl shall stoop from his turret, the rat cry out

a winter ship
at this wharf there are no grand landings to speak of
red and orange barges list and blister
shackled to the dock, outmoded, gaudy,
and apparently indestructible
the sea pulses under a skin of oil

a gull holds his pose on a shanty ridgepole,
riding the tide of the wind, steady
as wood and formal, in a jacket of ashes,
the whole flat harbor anchored in
the round of his yellow eyebutton
a blimp swims up like a daymoon or tin
cigar over his rink of fishes
the prospect is dull as an old etching
they are unloading three barrels of little crabs
the pier pilings seem about to collapse
and with them that rickety edifice
of warehouses, derricks, smokestacks and bridges
in the distance all around us the water slips
and gossips in its loose vernacular,
ferrying the smells of dead cod and tar
farther out, the waves will be mouthing icecakes
a poor month for parksleepers and lovers
even our shadows are blue with cold
we wanted to see the sun come up
and are met, instead, by this iceribbed ship,
bearded and blown, an albatross of frost,
relic of tough weather, every winch and stay
encased in a glassy pellicle
the sun will diminish it soon enough
each wavetip glitters like a knife

aftermath
compelled by calamitys magnet
they loiter and stare as if the house
burntout were theirs, or as if they thought
some scandal might any minute ooze
from a smokechoked closet into light
no deaths, no prodigious injuries
glut these hunters after an old meat,
bloodspoor of the austere tragedies

mother medea in a green smock
moves humbly as any housewife through
her ruined apartments, taking stock
of charred shoes, the sodden upholstery
cheated of the pyre and the rack,
the crowd sucks her last tear and turns away
two views of a cadaver room
i
the day she visited the dissecting room
they had four men laid out, black as burnt turkey,
already half unstrung a vinegary fume
of the death vats clung to them
the whitesmocked boys started working
the head of his cadaver had caved in,
and she could scarcely make out anything
in that rubble of skull plates and old leather
a sallow piece of string held it together
in their jars the snailnosed babies moon and glow
he hands her the cutout heart like a cracked heirloom

in brueghels panorama of smoke and slaughter
two people only are blind to the carrion army
he, afloat in the sea of her blue satin
skirts, sings in the direction
of her bare shoulder, while she bends,
fingering a leaflet of music, over him,
both of them deaf to the fiddle in the hands
of the deathshead shadowing their song
these flemish lovers flourish not for long
yet desolation, stalled in paint, spares the little country
foolish, delicate, in the lower right hand corner


suicide off egg rock
behind him the hotdogs split and drizzled
on the public grills, and the ochreous salt flats,
gas tanks, factory stacksthat landscape
of imperfections his bowels were part of
rippled and pulsed in the glassy updraught
sun struck the water like a damnation
no pit of shadow to crawl into,
and his blood beating the old tattoo
i am, i am, i am children
were squealing where combers broke and the spindrift
raveled windripped from the crest of the wave
a mongrel working his legs to a gallop
hustled a gull flock to flap off the sandspit
he smoldered, as if stonedeaf, blindfold,
his body beached with the seas garbage,
a machine to breathe and beat forever
flies filing in through a dead skates eyehole
buzzed and assailed the vaulted brainchamber
the words in his book wormed off the pages
everything glittered like blank paper
everything shrank in the suns corrosive
ray but egg rock on the blue wastage
he heard when he walked into the water
the forgetful surf creaming on those ledges

the ravaged face
outlandish as a circus, the ravaged face
parades the marketplace, lurid and stricken
by some unutterable chagrin,
maudlin from leaky eye to swollen nose
two pinlegs stagger underneath the mass
grievously purpled, mouth skewered on a groan,
past keeping to the house, past all discretion
myself, myselfobscene, lugubrious
ii
better the flat leer of the idiot,
the stone face of the man who doesnt feel,
the velvet dodges of the hypocrite
better, better, and more acceptable
to timorous children, to the lady on the street
o oedipus o christ you use me ill
ig march
metaphors
im a riddle in nine syllables,
an elephant, a ponderous house,
a melon strolling on two tendrils
o red fruit, ivory, fine timbers
this loafs big with its yeasty rising
moneys newminted in this fat purse
im a means, a stage, a cow in calf
ive eaten a bag of green apples,
boarded the train theres no getting off

electra on azalea path
the day you died i went into the dirt,
into the lightless hibernaculum
where bees, striped black and gold, sleep out the blizzard
like hieratic stones, and the ground is hard
it was good for twenty years, that wintering
as if you had never existed, as if i came
godfathered into the world from my mothers belly
her wide bed wore the stain of divinity
i had nothing to do with guilt or anything
when i wormed back under my mothers heart
small as a doll in my dress of innocence
i lay dreaming your epic, image by image
nobody died or withered on that stage

everything took place in a durable whiteness
the day i woke, i woke on churchyard hill
i found your name, i found your bones and all
enlisted in a cramped necropolis,
your speckled stone askew by an iron fence
in this charity ward, this poorhouse, where the dead
crowd foot to foot, head to head, no flower
breaks the soil this is azalea path
a field of burdock opens to the south
six feet of yellow gravel cover you
the artificial red sage does not stir
in the basket of plastic evergreens they put
at the headstone next to yours, nor does it rot,
although the rains dissolve a bloody dye
the ersatz petals drip, and they drip red
another kind of redness bothers me
the day your slack sail drank my sisters breath
the flat sea purpled like that evil cloth
my mother unrolled at your last homecoming
i borrow the stilts of an old tragedy
the truth is, one late october, at my birthcry
a scorpion stung its head, an illstarred thing
my mother dreamed you face down in the sea
the stony actors poise and pause for breath
i brought my love to bear, and then you died
it was the gangrene ate you to the bone
my mother said you died like any man
how shall i age into that state of mind ?
i am the ghost of an infamous suicide,
my own blue razor rusting in my throat
o pardon the one who knocks for pardon at
your gate, fatheryour houndbitch, daughter, friend
it was my love that did us both to death

the beekeepers daughter
a garden of mouthings purple, scarletspeckled, black
the great corollas dilate, peeling back their silks
their musk encroaches, circle after circle,
a well of scents almost too dense to breathe in
hieratical in your frock coat, maestro of the bees,
you move among the manybreasted hives,
my heart under your foot, sister of a stone
trumpetthroats open to the beaks of birds
the golden rain tree drips its powders down
in these little boudoirs streaked with orange and red
the anthers nod their heads, potent as kings
to father dynasties the air is rich
here is a queenship no mother can contest
a fruit thats death to taste dark flesh, dark parings
in burrows narrow as a finger, solitary bees
keep house among the grasses kneeling down
i set my eye to a holemouth and meet an eye
round, green, disconsolate as a tear
father, bridegroom, in this easter egg
under the coronal of sugar roses
the queen bee marries the winter of your year
the hermit at outermost house
sky and sea, horizonhinged
tablets of blank blue, couldnt,
clapped shut, flatten this man out
the great gods, stonehead, clawfoot,
winded by much rockbumping
and clawthreat, realized that

for what, then, had they endured
dourly the long hots and colds,
those old despots, if he sat
laughshaken on his doorsill,
backbone unbendable as
timbers of his upright hut?
hard gods were there, nothing else
still he thumbed out something else
thumbed no stony, horny pot,
but a certain meaning green
he withstood them, that hermit
rockface, crabclaw verged on green
gulls mulled in the greenest light
man in black
where the three magenta
breakwaters take the shove
and suck of the gray sea
to the left, and the wave
unfists against the dun
barbwired headland of
the deer island prison
with its trim piggeries,
hen huts and cattle green
to the right, and march ice
glazes the rock pools yet,
snuffcolored sand cliffs rise
over a great stone spit
bared by each falling tide,
and you, across those white

stones, strode out in your dead
black coat, black shoes, and your
black hair till there you stood,
fixed vortex on the far
tip, riveting stones, air,
all of it, together
old ladies home
sharded in black, like beetles,
frail as antique earthenware
one breath might shiver to bits,
the old women creep out here
to sun on the rocks or prop
themselves up against the wall
whose stones keep a little heat
needles knit in a birdbeaked
counterpoint to their voices
sons, daughters, daughters and sons,
distant and cold as photos,
grandchildren nobody knows
age wears the best black fabric
rustred or green as lichens
at owlcall the old ghosts flock
to hustle them off the lawn
from beds boxedin like coffins
the bonneted ladies grin
and death, that baldhead buzzard,
stalls in halls where the lamp wick
shortens with each breath drawn

the netmenders
halfway up from the little harbor of sardine boats,
halfway down from groves where the thin, bitter almond pips
fatten in greenpocked pods, the three netmenders sit out,
dressed in black, everybody in mourning for someone
they set their stout chairs back to the road and face the dark
dominoes of their doorways
sun grains their crowcolors,
purples the fig in the leafs shadow, turns the dust pink
on the road named for tomas ortunio, mica
winks like money under the ringed toes of the chickens
the houses are white as seasalt goats lick from the rocks
while their fingers work with the coarse mesh and the fine
their eyes revolve the whole town like a blue and green ball
nobody dies or is born without their knowing it
they talk of bridelace, of lovers spunky as gamecocks
the moon leans, a stone madonna, over the lead sea
and the iron hills that enclose them earthen fingers
twist old words into the webthreads
tonight may the fish
be a harvest of silver in the nets, and the lamps
of our husbands and sons move sure among the low stars
magnolia shoals
up here among the gull cries
we stroll through a maze of pale
redmottled relics, shells, claws
as if it were summer still
that season has turned its back
though the green sea gardens stall,

bow, and recover their look
of the imperishable
gardens in an antique book
or tapestries on a wall,
leaves behind us warp and lapse
the late month withers, as well
below us a white gull keeps
the weedslicked shelf for his own,
hustles other gulls off crabs
rove over his field of stone
mussels cluster blue as grapes
his beak brings the harvest in
the watercolorist grips
his brush in the stringent air
the horizons bare of ships,
the beach and the rocks are bare
he paints a blizzard of gulls,
wings drumming in the winter
october
no
the sleepers
no map traces the street
where those two sleepers are
we have lost track of it
they lie as if under water
in a blue, unchanging light,
the french window ajar
curtained with yellow lace
through the narrow crack
odors of wet earth rise
the snail leaves a silver track

dark thickets hedge the house
we take a backward look
among petals pale as death
and leaves steadfast in shape
they sleep on, mouth to mouth
a white mist is going up
the small green nostrils breathe,
and they turn in their sleep
ousted from that warm bed
we are a dream they dream
their eyelids keep the shade
no harm can come to them
we cast our skins and slide
into another time
yaddo the grand manor
woodsmoke and a distant loudspeaker
filter into this clear
air, and blur
the red tomatos in, the green bean
the cook lugs a pumpkin
from the vine
for pies the fir trees thick with grackles
gold carp loom in the pools
a wasp crawls
over windfalls to sip ciderjuice
guests in the studios
muse, compose
indoors, tiffanys phoenix rises
above the fireplace
two carved sleighs

rest on orange plush near the newel post
wood stoves burn warm as toast
the late guest
wakens, mornings, to a cobalt sky,
a diamondpaned window,
zincwhite snow
medallion
by the gate with star and moon
worked into the peeled orange wood
t h e bronze snake lay in the sun
inert as a shoelace dead
but pliable still, his jaw
unhinged and his grin crooked,
tongue a rosecolored arrow
over my hand i hung him
his little vermilion eye
ignited with a glassed flame
as i turned him in the light
when i split a rock one time
the garnet bits burned like that
dust dulled his back to ochre
the way sun ruins a trout
yet his belly kept its fire
going under the chainmail,
the old jewels smoldering there
in each opaque bellyscale
sunset looked at through milk glass
and i saw white maggots coil

thin as pins in the dark bruise
where his innards bulged as if
he were digesting a mouse
knifelike, he was chaste enough,
pure deathsmetal the yardmans
flung brick perfected his laugh
the manor garden
the fountains are dry and the roses over
incense of death your day approaches
the pears fatten like little buddhas
a blue mist is dragging the lake
you move through the era of fishes,
the smug centuries of the pig
head, toe and finger
come clear of the shadow history
nourishes these broken flutings,
these crowns of acanthus,
and the crow settles her garments
you inherit white heather, a bees wing,
two suicides, the family wolves,
hours of blankness some hard stars
already yellow the heavens
the spider on its own string
crosses the lake the worms
quit their usual habitations
the small birds converge, converge
with their gifts to a difficult borning

u
blue moles
d
theyre out of the darks ragbag, these two
moles dead in the pebbled rut,
shapeless as flung gloves, a few feet apart
blue suede a dog or fox has chewed
one, by himself, seemed pitiable enough,
little victim unearthed by some large creature
from his orbit under the elm root
the second carcass makes a duel of the affair
blind twins bitten by bad nature
the skys far dome is sane and clear
leaves, undoing their yellow caves
between the road and the lake water,
bare no sinister spaces already
the moles look neutral as the stones
their corkscrew noses, their white hands
uplifted, stiffen in a family pose
difficult to imagine how fury struck
dissolved now, smoke of an old war

nightly the battleshouts start up
in the ear of the veteran, and again
i enter the soft pelt of the mole
lights death to them they shrivel in it
they move through their mute rooms while i sleep,
palming the earth aside, grubbers
after the fat children of root and rock
by day, only the topsoil heaves
down there one is alone
outsize hands prepare a path,
they go before opening the veins,
delving for the appendages
of beetles, sweetbreads, shardsto be eaten

over and over and still the heaven
of final surfeit is just as far
from the door as ever what happens between
happens in darkness, vanishes
easy and often as each breath
dark wood, dark water
this wood burns a dark
incense pale moss drips
in elbowscarves, beards
from the archaic
bones of the great trees
blue mists move over
a lake thick with fish
snails scroll the border
of the glazed water
with coils of ramshorn
out in the open
down there the late year
hammers her rare and
various metals
old pewter roots twist
up from the jetbacked
mirror of water
and while the airs clear
hourglass sifts a
drift of goldpieces
bright waterlights are
sliding their quoits one
after the other
down boles of the fir

pollys tree
a dream tree, pollys tree
a thicket of sticks,
each speckled twig
ending in a thinpaned
leaf unlike any
other on it
or in a ghost flower
flat as paper and
of a color
vaporish as frostbreath,
more finical than
any silk fan
the chinese ladies use
to stir robins egg
air the silver
haired seed of the milkweed
comes to roost there, frail
as the halo
rayed round a candle flame,
a willothewisp
nimbus, or puff
of cloudstuff, tipping her
queer candelabrum
palely lit by
snuffruffed dandelions,
white daisy wheels and
a tigerfaced
pansy, it glows o its
no family tree,
pollys tree, nor

a tree of heaven, though
it marry quartzflake,
feather and rose
it sprang from her pillow
whole as a cobweb,
ribbed like a hand,
a dream tree pollys tree
wears a valentine
arc of tearpearled
bleeding hearts on its sleeve
and, crowning it, one
blue larkspur star
the colossus
i shall never get you put together entirely,
pieced, glued, and properly jointed
mulebray, piggrunt and bawdy cackles
proceed from your great lips
its worse than a barnyard
perhaps you consider yourself an oracle,
mouthpiece of the dead, or of some god or other
thirty years now i have labored
to dredge the silt from your throat
i am none the wiser
scaling little ladders with gluepots and pails of lysol
i crawl like an ant in mourning
over the weedy acres of your brow
to mend the immense skullplates and clear
the bald, white tumuli of your eyes
a blue sky out of the oresteia
arches above us o father, all by yourself
you are pithy and historical as the roman forum

i open my lunch on a hill of black cypress
your fluted bones and acanthine hair are littered
in their old anarchy to the horizonline
it would take more than a lightningstroke
t o create such a ruin
nights, i squat in the cornucopia
of your left ear, out of the wind,
counting the red stars and those of plumcolor
the sun rises under the pillar of your tongue
my hours are married to shadow
no longer do i listen for the scrape of a keel
on the blank stones of the landing
private ground
first frost, and i walk among the rosefruit, the marble toes
of the greek beauties you brought
off europes relic heap
t o sweeten your neck of the new york woods
soon each white lady will be boarded up
against the cracking climate
all morning, with smoking breath, the handyman
has been draining the goldfish ponds
they collapse like lungs, the escaped water
threading back, filament by filament, to the pure
platonic table where it lives the baby carp
litter the mud like orangepeel
eleven weeks, and i know your estate so well
i need hardly go out at all
a superhighway seals me off
trading their poisons, the north and south bound cars
flatten the doped snakes to ribbon in here, the grasses
unload their griefs on my shoes,

the woods creak and ache, and the day forgets itself
i bend over this drained basin where the small fish
flex as the mud freezes
they glitter like eyes, and i collect them all
morgue of old logs and old images, the lake
opens and shuts, accepting them among its reflections
poem for a birthday
who
the month of flowerings finished the fruits in,
eaten or rotten i am all mouth
octobers the month for storage
this sheds fusty as a mummys stomach
old tools, handles and rusty tusks
i am at home here among the dead heads
let me sit in a flowerpot,
the spiders wont notice
my heart is a stopped geranium
if only the wind would leave my lungs alone
dogbody noses the petals they bloom upside down
they rattle like hydrangea bushes
moldering heads console me,
nailed to the rafters yesterday
inmates who dont hibernate
cabbageheads wormy purple, silverglaze,
a dressing of mule ears, mothy pelts, but greenhearted,
their veins white as porkfat
o the beauty of usage
the orange pumpkins have no eyes
these halls are full of women who think they are birds

this is a dull school
i am a root, a stone, an owl pellet,
without dreams of any sort
mother, you are the one mouth
i would be a tongue to mother of otherness
eat me wastebasket gaper, shadow of doorway
i said i must remember this, being small
there were such enormous flowers,
purple and red mouths, utterly lovely
the hoops of blackberry stems made me cry
now they light me up like an electric bulb
for weeks i can remember nothing at all
dark house
this is a dark house, very big
i made it myself,
cell by cell from a quiet corner,
chewing at the gray paper,
oozing the glue drops,
whistling, wiggling my ears,
thinking of something else
it has so many cellars,
such eelish delvings
i am round as an owl,
i see by my own light
any day i may litter puppies
or mother a horse my belly moves
i must make more maps
these marrowy tunnels
moleyhanded, i eat my way
allmouth licks up the bushes
and the pots of meat
he lives in an old well,
a stony hole hes to blame
hes a fat sort

pebble smells, turnipy chambers
small nostrils are breathing
little humble loves
footlings, boneless as noses,
it is warm and tolerable
in the bowel of the root
heres a cuddly mother
j  maenad
once i was ordinary
sat by my fathers bean tree
eating the fingers of wisdom
the birds made milk
when it thundered i hid under a flat stone
the mother of mouths didnt love me
the old man shrank to a doll
i am too big to go backward
birdmilk is feathers,
the bean leaves are dumb as hands
this month is fit for little
the dead ripen in the grapeleaves
a red tongue is among us
mother, keep out of my barnyard,
am becoming another
doghead, devourer
feed me the berries of dark
the lids wont shut time
unwinds from the great umbilicus of the sun
its endless glitter
i must swallow it all
lady, who are these others in the moons vat
sleepdrunk, their limbs at odds ?
in this light the blood is black
tell me my name

q the beast
he was bullman earlier,
king of the dish, my lucky animal
breathing was easy in his airy holding
the sun sat in his armpit
nothing went moldy the little invisibles
waited on him hand and foot
the blue sisters sent me to another school
monkey lived under the dunce cap
he kept blowing me kisses
i hardly knew him
he wont be got rid of
mumblepaws, teary and sorry,
fido littlesoul, the bowels familiar
a dustbins enough for him
the darks his bone
call him any name, hell come to it
mudsump, happy styface
ive married a cupboard of rubbish
i bed in a fish puddle
down here the sky is always falling
hogwallows at the window
the star bugs wont save me this month
i housekeep in times gutend
among emmets and mollusks,
duchess of nothing,
hairtusks bride
flute notes from a reedy pond
now coldness comes sifting down, layer after layer,
to our bower at the lily root
overhead the old umbrellas of summer
wither like pithless hands there is little shelter
hourly the eye of the sky enlarges its blank
dominion the stars are no nearer
already frogmouth and fishmouth drink
the liquor of indolence, and all things sink

into a soft caul of forgetfulness
the fugitive colors die
caddis worms drowse in their silk cases,
the lampheaded nymphs are nodding to sleep like statues
puppets, loosed from the strings of the puppetmaster,
wear masks of horn to bed
this is not death, it is something safer
the wingy myths wont tug at us any more
the molts are tongueless that sang from above the water
of golgotha at the tip of a reed,
and how a god flimsy as a babys finger
shall unhusk himself and steer into the air
witch burning
in the marketplace they are piling the dry sticks
a thicket of shadows is a poor coat i inhabit
the wax image of myself, a dolls body
sickness begins here i am a dartboard for witches
only the devil can eat the devil out
in the month of red leaves i climb to a bed of fire
it is easy to blame the dark the mouth of a door,
the cellars belly theyve blown my sparkler out
a blacksharded lady keeps me in a parrot cage
what large eyes the dead have
i am intimate with a hairy spirit
smoke wheels from the beak of this empty jar
if i am a little one, i can do no harm
if i dont move about, ill knock nothing over so i said,
sitting under a potlid, tiny and inert as a rice grain
they are turning the burners up, ring after ring
we are full of starch, my small white fellows we grow
it hurts at first the red tongues will teach the truth
mother of beetles, only unclench your hand
ill fly through the candles mouth like a singeless moth

give me back my shape i am ready to construe the days
i coupled with dust in the shadow of a stone
my ankles brighten brightness ascends my thighs
i am lost, i am lost, in the robes of all this light
the stones
this is the city where men are mended
i lie on a great anvil
the flat blue skycircle
flew off like the hat of a doll
when i fell out of the light i entered
the stomach of indifference, the wordless cupboard
the mother of pestles diminished me
i became a still pebble
the stones of the belly were peaceable,
the headstone quiet, jostled by nothing
only the mouthhole piped out,
importunate cricket
in a quarry of silences
the people of the city heard it
they hunted the stones, taciturn and separate,
the mouthhole crying their locations
drunk as a foetus
i suck at the paps of darkness
the food tubes embrace me sponges kiss my lichens away
the jewelmaster drives his chisel to pry
open one stone eye
this is the afterhell i see the light
a wind unstoppers the chamber
of the ear, old worrier

water mollifies the flint lip,
and daylight lays its sameness on the wall
the grafters are cheerful,
heating the pincers, hoisting the delicate hammers
a current agitates the wires
volt upon volt catgut stitches my fissures
a workman walks by carrying a pink torso
the storerooms are full of hearts
this is the city of spare parts
my swaddled legs and arms smell sweet as rubber
here they can doctor heads, or any limb
on fridays the little children come
to trade their hooks for hands
dead men leave eyes for others
love is the uniform of my bald nurse
love is the bone and sinew of my curse
the vase, reconstructed, houses
the elusive rose
ten fingers shape a bowl for shadows
my mendings itch there is nothing to do
i shall be good as new

the burntout spa
an old beast ended in this place
a monster of wood and rusty teeth
fire smelted his eyes to lumps
of pale blue vitreous stuff, opaque
as resin drops oozed from pine bark

the rafters and struts of his body wear
their char of karakul still i cant tell
how long his carcass has foundered under
the rubbish of summers, the blackleaved falls
now little weeds insinuate
soft suede tongues between his bones
his armorplate, his toppled stones
are an esplanade for crickets
i pick and pry like a doctor or
archaeologist among
iron entrails, enamel bowls,
the coils and pipes that made him run
the small dell eats what ate it once
and yet the ichor of the spring
proceeds clear as it ever did
from the broken throat, the marshy lip
it flows off below the green and white
balustrade of a sagbacked bridge
leaning over, i encounter one
blue and improbable person
framed in a basketwork of cattails
o she is gracious and austere,
seated beneath the toneless water
it is not i, it is not i
no animal spoils on her green doorstep
and we shall never enter there
where the durable ones keep house
the stream that hustles us
neither nourishes nor heals

mushrooms
overnight, very
whitely, discreetly,
very quietly
our toes, our noses
take hold on the loam,
acquire the air
nobody sees us,
stops us, betrays us
the small grains make room
soft fists insist on
heaving the needles,
the leafy bedding,
even the paving
our hammers, our rams,
earless and eyeless,
perfectly voiceless,
widen the crannies,
shoulder through holes we
diet on water,
on crumbs of shadow,
blandmannered, asking
little or nothing
so many of us
so many of us
we are shelves, we are
tables, we are meek,
we are edible,
nudgers and shovers
in spite of ourselves
our kind multiplies

we shall by morning
inherit the earth
our foots in the door

mute as a turnip from the fourth

o highriser, my little loaf
vague as fog and looked for like mail
farther off than australia
bentbacked atlas, our traveled prawn

jumpy as a mexican bean

these poems do not live its a sad diagnosis
they grew their toes and fingers well enough,
their little foreheads bulged with concentration
if they missed out on walking about like people
it wasnt for any lack of motherlove
o i cannot understand what happened to them
they are proper in shape and number and every part
they sit so nicely in the pickling fluid
they smile and smile and smile and smile at me
and still the lungs wont fill and the heart wont start
they are not pigs, they are not even fish,
though they have a piggy and a fishy air
it would be better if they were alive, and thats what they were
but they are dead, and their mother near dead with distraction,
and they stupidly stare, and do not speak of her

midnight in the midatlantic on deck
wrapped up in themselves as in thick veiling
and mute as mannequins in a dress shop,
some few passengers keep track
of the old starmap on the ceiling
tiny and far, a single ship

carries its candles slowly off
now there is nothing much to look at
still nobody will move or speak

hell be rich in a year and he should know

sleep in the mojave desert
out here there are no hearthstones,
hot grains, simply it is dry, dry
and the air dangerous noonday acts queerly
on the minds eye, erecting a line
of poplars in the middle distance, the only
object beside the mad, straight road
one can remember men and houses by

a cool wind should inhabit those leaves
and a dew collect on them, dearer than money,
in the blue hour before sunup
yet they recede, untouchable as tomorrow,
or those glittery fictions of spilt water
that glide ahead of the very thirsty
i think of the lizards airing their tongues
in the crevice of an extremely small shadow
and the toad guarding his hearts droplet
the desert is white as a blind mans eye,
comfortless as salt snake and bird
doze behind the old masks of fury
we swelter like firedogs in the wind
the sun puts its cinder out where we lie
the heatcracked crickets congregate
in their black armorplate and cry
the daymoon lights up like a sorry mother,

two campers in cloud country
rock lake, canada
in this country there is neither measure nor balance
to redress the dominance of rocks and woods,
the passage, say, of these manshaming clouds
no gesture of yours or mine could catch their attention,
no word make them carry water or fire the kindling
like local trolls in the spell of a superior being
well, one wearies of the public gardens one wants a vacatior
where trees and clouds and animals pay no notice
away from the labeled elms, the tame tearoses
igo
it took three days driving north to find a cloud
the polite skies over boston couldnt possibly accommodate
here on the last frontier of the big, brash spirit
the horizons are too far off to be chummy as uncles
the colors assert themselves with a sort of vengeance
each day concludes in a huge splurge of vermilions
and night arrives in one gigantic step
it is comfortable, for a change, to mean so little
these rocks offer no purchase to herbage or people
they are conceiving a dynasty of perfect cold
in a month well wonder what plates and forks are for
i lean to you, numb as a fossil tell me im here
the pilgrims and indians might never have happened
planets pulse in the lake like bright amoebas
the pines blot our voices up in their lightest sighs
around our tent the old simplicities sough
sleepily as lethe, trying to get in
well wake blankbrained as water in the dawn

leaving early
lady, your room is lousy with flowers
when you kick me out, thats what ill remember,
me, sitting here bored as a leopard
in your jungle of winebottle lamps,
velvet pillows the colour of blood pudding
and the white china flying fish from italy
i forget you, hearing the cut flowers
sipping their liquids from assorted pots,
pitchers and coronation goblets
like monday drunkards the milky berries
bow down, a local constellation,
higo
toward their admirers in the tabletop
mobs of eyeballs looking up
are those petals or leaves youve paired them with
those greenstriped ovals of silver tissue ?
the red geraniums i know
friends, friends they stink of armpits
and the involved maladies of autumn,
musky as a lovebed the morning after
my nostrils prickle with nostalgia
henna hags cloth of your cloth
they toe old water thick as fog
the roses in the toby jug
gave up the ghost last night high time
their yellow corsets were ready to split
you snored, and i heard the petals unlatch,
tapping and ticking like nervous fingers
you should have junked them before they died
daybreak discovered the bureau lid
littered with chinese hands now im stared at
by chrysanthemums the size
of holofernes head, dipped in the same
magenta as this fubsy sofa
in the mirror their doubles back them up
listen your tenant mice
are rattling the cracker packets fine flour
muffles their birdfeet they whistle for joy
and you doze on, nose to the wall
this mizzle fits me like a sad jacket
how did we make it up to your attic ?
you handed me gin in a glass bud vase
we slept like stones lady, what am i doing
with a lung full of dust and a tongue of wood,
kneedeep in the cold and swamped by flowers ?

love letter
not easy to state the change you made
if im alive now, then i was dead,
though, like a stone, unbothered by it,
staying put according to habit
you didnt just toe me an inch, no
nor leave me to set my small bald eye
skyward again, without hope, of course,
of apprehending blueness, or stars
that wasnt it i slept, say a snake
masked among black rocks as a black rock
in the white hiatus of winter
like my neighbors, taking no pleasure
in the million perfectlychiseled
cheeks alighting each moment to melt
my cheek of basalt they turned to tears,
angels weeping over dull natures,
but didnt convince me those tears froze
each dead head had a visor of ice
and i slept on like a bent finger
the first thing i saw was sheer air
and the locked drops rising in a dew
limpid as spirits many stones lay
dense and expressionless round about
i didnt know what to make of it
i shone, micascaled, and unfolded
to pour myself out like a fluid
among bird feet and the stems of plants
i wasnt fooled i knew you at once
tree and stone glittered, without shadows
my fingerlength grew lucent as glass
i started to bud like a march twig
an arm and a leg, an arm, a leg
from stone to cloud, so i ascended
now i resemble a sort of god
floating through the air in my soulshift
pure as a pane of ice its a gift

magi
the abstracts hover like dull angels
nothing so vulgar as a nose or an eye
bossing the ethereal blanks of their faceovals
their whiteness bears no relation to laundry,
snow, chalk or suchlike theyre
the real thing, all right the good, the true
salutary and pure as boiled water,
loveless as the multiplication table
while the child smiles into thin air
six months in the world, and she is able
to rock on all fours like a padded hammock
for her, the heavy notion of evil
attending her cot is less than a belly ache,
and love the mother of milk, no theory
they mistake their star, these papery godfolk
they want the crib of some lampheaded plato
let them astound his heart with their merit
what girl ever flourished in such company ?

candles
they are the last romantics, these candles
upside down hearts of light tipping wax fingers,
and the fingers, taken in by their own haloes,
grown milky, almost clear, like the bodies of saints
it is touching, the way theyll ignore
a whole family of prominent objects
simply to plumb the deeps of an eye
in its hollow of shadows, its fringe of reeds,
and the owner past thirty, no beauty at all
daylight would be more judicious,
igo
giving everybody a fair hearing
they should have gone out with balloon flights and the stereopticon
this is no time for the private point of view
when i light them, my nostrils prickle
their pale, tentative yellows
drag up false, edwardian sentiments,
and i remember my maternal grandmother from vienna
as a schoolgirl she gave roses to franz josef
the burghers sweated and wept the children wore white
and my grandfather moped in the tyrol,
imagining himself a headwaiter in america,
floating in a highchurch hush
among ice buckets, frosty napkins
these little globes of light are sweet as pears
kindly with invalids and mawkish women,
they mollify the bald moon
nunsouled, they burn heavenward and never marry
the eyes of the child i nurse are scarcely open
in twenty years i shall be retrograde
as these draughty ephemerids
i watch their spilt tears cloud and dull to pearls
how shall i tell anything at all
to this infant still in a birthdrowse ?
tonight, like a shawl, the mild light enfolds her,
the shadows stoop over like guests at a christening

flick the glass with your fingernail
it will ping like a chinese chime in the slightest air stir
though nobody in there looks up or bothers to answer
the inhabitants are light as cork,
every one of them permanently busy
at their feet, the sea waves bow in single file,
never trespassing in bad temper
stalling in midair,
shortreined, pawing like paradeground horses
overhead, the clouds sit tasseled and fancy
as victorian cushions this family
of valentinefaces might please a collector
they ring true, like good china
elsewhere the landscape is more frank
the light falls without letup, blindingly
a woman is dragging her shadow in a circle
about a bald, hospital saucer
it resembles the moon, or a sheet of blank paper
and appears to have suffered a sort of private blitzkrieg
she lives quietly
with no attachments, like a foetus in a bottle,
the obsolete house, the sea, flattened to a picture
she has one too many dimensions to enter
grief and anger, exorcized,
leave her alone now
the future is a gray seagull
tattling in its catvoice of departure, departure
age and terror, like nurses, attend her,
and a drowned man, complaining of the great cold,
crawls up out of the sea

winter dawn is the color of metal,
the trees stiffen into place like burnt nerves
all night i have dreamed of destruction, annihilations
an assemblyline of cut throats, and you and i
inching off in the gray chevrolet, drinking the green
poison of stilled lawns, the little clapboard gravestones,
noiseless, on rubber wheels, on the way to the sea resort
how the balconies echoed how the sun lit up
the skulls, the unbuckled bones facing the view
space space the bed linen was giving out entirely
cot legs melted in terrible attitudes, and the nurses
each nurse patched her soul to a wound and disappeared
the deathly guests had not been satisfied
with the rooms, or the smiles, or the beautiful rubber plants,
or the sea, hushing their peeled sense like old mother morphia

parliament hill fields
on this bald hill the new year hones its edge
faceless and pale as china
the round sky goes on minding its business
your absence is inconspicuous
nobody can tell what i lack
gulls have threaded the rivers mud bed back

settling and stirring like blown paper
or the hands of an invalid the wan
sun manages to strike such tin glints
from the linked ponds that my eyes wince
and brim the city melts like sugar
a crocodile of small girls
knotting and stopping, illassorted, in blue uniforms,
opens to swallow me im a stone, a stick,
one child drops a barrette of pink plastic
none of them seem to notice
their shrill, gravelly gossips funneled off
now silence after silence offers itself
the wind stops my breath like a bandage

swaddles roof and tree
it could be a snowfield or a cloudbank
i suppose its pointless to think of you at all
already your doll grip lets go

your cry fades like the cry of a gnat
i lose sight of you on your blind journey,
while the heath grass glitters and the spindling rivulets
unspool and spend themselves my mind runs with them,
pooling in heelprints, fumbling pebble and stem
the day empties its images
like a cup or a room the moons crook whitens,
thin as the skin seaming a scar
now, on the nursery wall,
the blue night plants, the little pale blue hill
in your sisters birthday picture start to glow
the orange pompons, the egyptian papyrus
light up each rabbiteared
blue shrub behind the glass

a sort of cellophane balloon

smiling to themselves, they meditate
devoutly as the dutch bulb
forming its twenty petals
the dark still nurses its secret
on the green hill, under the thorn trees,
they listen for the millennium,
the knock of the small, new heart
pinkbuttocked infants attend them
looping wool, doing nothing in particular,
they step among the archetypes
dusk hoods them in maryblue
while far off, the axle of winter
grinds round, bearing down with the straw,
the star, the wise gray men

in plaster
i shall never get out of this there are two of me now
this new absolutely white person and the old yellow one,
and the white person is certainly the superior one
she doesnt need food, she is one of the real saints
at the beginning i hated her, she had no personality
she lay in bed with me like a dead body
and i was scared, because she was shaped just the way i was
only much whiter and unbreakable and with no complaints
i couldnt sleep for a week, she was so cold
iqi
i blamed her for everything, but she didnt answer
i couldnt understand her stupid behavior
when i hit her she held still, like a true pacifist
then i realized what she wanted was for me to love her
she began to warm up, and i saw her advantages
without me, she wouldnt exist, so of course she was grateful
i gave her a soul, i bloomed out of her as a rose
blooms out of a vase of not very valuable porcelain,
and it was i who attracted everybodys attention,
not her whiteness and beauty, as i had at first supposed
i patronized her a little, and she lapped it up
you could tell almost at once she had a slave mentality
i didnt mind her waiting on me, and she adored it
in the morning she woke me early, reflecting the sun
from her amazingly white torso, and i couldnt help but notice
her tidiness and her calmness and her patience
she humored my weakness like the best of nurses,
holding my bones in place so they would mend properly
in time our relationship grew more intense
she stopped fitting me so closely and seemed offish
i felt her criticizing me in spite of herself,
as if my habits offended her in some way
she let in the drafts and became more and more absentminded
and my skin itched and flaked away in soft pieces
simply because she looked after me so badly
then i saw what the trouble was she thought she was immortal
she wanted to leave me, she thought she was superior,
and id been keeping her in the dark, and she was resentful
wasting her days waiting on a halfcorpse
and secretly she began to hope id die
then she could cover my mouth and eyes, cover me entirely,
and wear my painted face the way a mummycase
wears the face of a pharaoh, though its made of mud and water
i wasnt in any position to get rid of her
shed supported me for so long i was quite limp
i had even forgotten how to walk or sit,
iiqi
so i was careful not to upset her in any way
or brag ahead of time how id avenge myself
living with her was like living with my own coffin
yet i still depended on her, though i did it regretfully
i used to think we might make a go of it together
after all, it was a kind of marriage, being so close
now i see it must be one or the other of us
she may be a saint, and i may be ugly and hairy,
but shell soon find out that that doesnt matter a bit
im collecting my strength one day i shall manage without her,
and shell perish with emptiness then, and begin to miss me

tulips
the tulips are too excitable, it is winter here
look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowedin
i am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly
as the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands
i am nobody i have nothing to do with explosions
i have given my name and my dayclothes up to the nurses
and my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons
they have propped my head between the pillow and the sheetcuff
like an eye between two white lids that will not shut
stupid pupil, it has to take everything in
the nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,
they pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,
doing things with their hands, one just the same as another,
so it is impossible to tell how many there are
my body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water
tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently
they bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep
now i have lost myself i am sick of baggage
my patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,
my husband and child smiling out of the family photo
their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks
iqi
i hav let things slip, a thirtyyearold cargo boat
stubbornly hanging on to my name and address
they have swabbed me clear of my loving associations
scared and bare on the green plasticpillowed trolley
i watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books
sink out of sight, and the water went over my head
i am a nun now, i have never been so pure
i didnt want any flowers, i only wanted
to lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty
how free it is, you have no idea how free
the peacefulness is so big it dazes you,
and it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets
it is what the dead close on, finally i imagine them
shutting their mouths on it, like a communion tablet
the tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me
even through the gift paper i could hear them breathe
lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby
their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds
they are subtle they seem to float, though they weigh me down,
upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,
a dozen red lead sinkers round my neck
nobody watched me before, now i am watched
the tulips turn to me, and the window behind me
where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,
and i see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cutpaper shadow
between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,
and i have no face, i have wanted to efface myself
the vivid tulips eat my oxygen
before they came the air was calm enough,
coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss
then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise
now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river
snags and eddies round a sunken rustred engine
they concentrate my attention, that was happy
playing and resting without committing itself
igi
the walls, also, seem to be warming themselves
the tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals
they are opening like the mouth of some great african cat,
and i am aware of my heart it opens and closes
its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me
the water i taste is warm and salt, like the sea,
and comes from a country far away as health
march igi
i
i am vertical
but i would rather be horizontal
i am not a tree with my root in the soil
sucking up minerals and motherly love
so that each march i may gleam into leaf,
nor am i the beauty of a garden bed
attracting my share of ahs and spectacularly painted,
unknowing i must soon unpetal
compared with me, a tree is immortal
and a flowerhead not tall, but more startling,
and i want the ones longevity and the others daring
tonight, in the infinitesimal light of the stars,
the trees and flowers have been strewing their cool odors
i walk among them, but none of them are noticing
sometimes i think that when i am sleeping
i must most perfectly resemble them
thoughts gone dim
it is more natural to me, lying down
then the sky and i are in open conversation,
and i shall be useful when i lie down finally
then the trees may touch me for once, and the flowers have time for me

insomniac
the night sky is only a sort of carbon paper,
blueblack, with the muchpoked periods of stars
letting in the light, peephole after peephole
a bonewhite light, like death, behind all things
under the eyes of the stars and the moons rictus
he suffers his desert pillow, sleeplessness
stretching its fine, irritating sand in all directions
over and over the old, granular movie
exposes embarrassmentsthe mizzling days
of childhood and adolescence, sticky with dreams,
parental faces on tall stalks, alternately stern and tearful,
a garden of buggy roses that made him cry
his forehead is bumpy as a sack of rocks
memories jostle each other for faceroom like obsolete film stars
he is immune to pills red, purple, blue
how they lit the tedium of the protracted evening
those sugary planets whose influence won for him
a life baptized in nolife for a while,
and the sweet, drugged waking of a forgetful baby
now the pills are wornout and silly, like classical gods
their poppysleepy colors do him no good
his head is a little interior of gray mirrors
each gesture flees immediately down an alley
of diminishing perspectives, and its significance
drains like water out the hole at the far end
he lives without privacy in a lidless room,
the bald slots of his eyes stiffened wideopen
on the incessant heatlightning flicker of situations
nightlong, in the granite yard, invisible cats
have been howling like women, or damaged instruments
already he can feel daylight, his white disease,
creeping up with her hatful of trivial repetitions
the city is a map of cheerful twitters now,
and everywhere people, eyes micasilver and blank,
are riding to work in rows, as if recently brainwashed

widow
widow the word consumes itself
body, a sheet of newsprint on the fire
levitating a numb minute in the updraft
over the scalding, red topography
that will put her heart out like an only eye
widow the dead syllable, with its shadow
of an echo, exposes the panel in the wall
behind which the secret passage liesstale air,
fusty remembrances, the coiledspring stair
that opens at the top onto nothing at all
widow the bitter spider sits
and sits in the center of her loveless spokes
death is the dress she wears, her hat and collar
the mothface of her husband, moon white and ill,
circles her like a prey shed love to kill
a second time, to have him near again
a paper image to lay against her heart
the way she laid his letters, till they grew warm
and seemed to give her warmth, like a live skin
but it is she who is paper now, warmed by no one
widow that great, vacant estate
the voice of god is full of draftiness,
promising simply the hard stars, the space
of immortal blankness between stars
and no bodies, singing like arrows up to heaven
widow, the compassionate trees bend in,
the trees of loneliness, the trees of mourning
they stand like shadows about the green landscape
or even like black holes cut out of it
a widow resembles them, a shadowthing,
hand folding hand, and nothing in between
a bodiless soul could pass another soul
in this clear air and never notice it
igbi
one soul pass through the other, frail as smoke
and utterly ignorant of the way it took
that is the fear she hasthe fear
his soul may beat and be beating at her dull sense
like blue marys angel, dovelike against a pane
blinded to all but the gray, spiritless room
it looks in on, and must go on looking in on

stars over the dordogne
stars are dropping thick as stones into the twiggy
picket of trees whose silhouette is darker
than the dark of the sky because it is quite starless
the woods are a well the stars drop silently
they seem large, yet they drop, and no gap is visible
nor do they send up fires where they fall
or any signal of distress or anxiousness
they are eaten immediately by the pines
where i am at home, only the sparsest stars
arrive at twilight, and then after some effort
and they are wan, dulled by much travelling
the smaller and more timid never arrive at all
but stay, sitting far out, in their own dust
they are orphans i cannot see them they are lost
but tonight they have discovered this river with no trouble,
they are scrubbed and selfassured as the great planets
the big dipper is my only familiar
i miss orion and cassiopeias chair maybe they are
hanging shyly under the studded horizon
like a childs toosimple mathematical problem
infinite number seems to be the issue up there
or else they are present, and their disguise so bright
i am overlooking them by looking too hard
perhaps it is the season that is not right

igiigi
and what if the sky here is no different,
and it is my eyes that have been sharpening themselves ?
such a luxury of stars would embarrass me
the few i am used to are plain and durable
i think they would not wish for this dressy backcloth
or much company, or the mildness of the south
they are too puritan and solitary for that
when one of them falls it leaves a space,
a sense of absence in its old shining place
and where i lie now, back to my own dark star,
i see those constellations in my head,
unwarmed by the sweet air of this peach orchard
there is too much ease here these stars treat me too well
on this hill, with its view of lit castles, each swung bell
is accounting for its cow i shut my eyes
and drink the small night chill like news of home
the rival
if the moon smiled, she would resemble you
you leave the same impression
of something beautiful, but annihilating
both of you are great light borrowers
her omouth grieves at the world yours is unaffected,
and your first gift is making stone out of everything
i wake to a mausoleum you are here,
ticking your fingers on the marble table, looking for cigarettes,
spiteful as a woman, but not so nervous,
and dying to say something unanswerable
the moon, too, abases her subjects,
but in the daytime she is ridiculous
your dissatisfactions, on the other hand,
arrive through the mailslot with loving regularity,
white and blank, expansive as carbon monoxide
igi
no day is safe from news of you,
walking about in africa maybe, but thinking of me

wuthering heights
the horizons ring me like faggots,
tilted and disparate, and always unstable
touched by a match, they might warm me,
and their fine lines singe
the air to orange
before the distances they pin evaporate,
weighting the pale sky with a solider color
but they only dissolve and dissolve
like a series of promises, as i step forward
there is no life higher than the grasstops
or the hearts of sheep, and the wind
pours by like destiny, bending
everything in one direction
i can feel it trying
to funnel my heat away
if i pay the roots of the heather
too close attention, they will invite me
to whiten my bones among them
the sheep know where they are,
browsing in their dirty woolclouds,
gray as the weather
the black slots of their pupils take me in
it is like being mailed into space,
a thin, silly message
they stand about in grandmotherly disguise,
all wig curls and yellow teeth
and hard, marbly baas
i come to wheel ruts, and water
limpid as the solitudes

igiiqi
that flee through my fingers
hollow doorsteps go from grass to grass
lintel and sill have unhinged themselves
of people the air only
remembers a few odd syllables
it rehearses them moaningly
black stone, black stone
the sky leans on me, me, the one upright
among all horizontals
the grass is beating its head distractedly
it is too delicate
for a life in such company
darkness terrifies it
now, in valleys narrow
and black as purses, the house lights
gleam like small change

blackberrying
nobody in the lane, and nothing, nothing but blackberries,
blackberries on either side, though on the right mainly,
a blackberry alley, going down in hooks, and a sea
somewhere at the end of it, heaving blackberries
big as the ball of my thumb, and dumb as eyes
ebon in the hedges, fat
with bluered juices these they squander on my fingers
i had not asked for such a blood sisterhood they must love me
they accommodate themselves to my milkbottle, flattening their sides
overhead go the choughs in black, cacophonous flocks
bits of burnt paper wheeling in a blown sky
theirs is the only voice, protesting, protesting
i do not think the sea will appear at all
the high, green meadows are glowing, as if lit from within
i come to one bush of berries so ripe it is a bush of flies,
hanging their bluegreen bellies and their wing panes in a chinese screen
iqi
the honeyfeast of the berries has stunned them they believe in heaven
one more hook, and the berries and bushes end
the only thing to come now is the sea
from between two hills a sudden wind funnels at me,
slapping its phantom laundry in my face
these hills are too green and sweet to have tasted salt
i follow the sheep path between them a last hook brings me
to the hills northern face, and the face is orange rock
that looks out on nothing, nothing but a great space
of white and pewter lights, and a din like silversmiths
beating and beating at an intractable metal

finisterre
this was the lands end the last fingers, knuckled and rheumatic,
cramped on nothing black
admonitory cliffs, and the sea exploding
with no bottom, or anything on the other side of it,
whitened by the faces of the drowned
now it is only gloomy, a dump of rocks
leftover soldiers from old, messy wars
the sea cannons into their ear, but they dont budge
other rocks hide their grudges under the water
the cliffs are edged with trefoils, stars and bells
such as fingers might embroider, close to death,
almost too small for the mists to bother with
the mists are part of the ancient paraphernalia
souls, rolled in the doomnoise of the sea
they bruise the rocks out of existence, then resurrect them
they go up without hope, like sighs
i walk among them, and they stuff my mouth with cotton
when they free me, i am beaded with tears
our lady of the shipwrecked is striding toward the horizon,
her marble skirts blown back in two pink wings
iqi
a marble sailor kneels at her foot distractedly, and at his foot
a peasant woman in black
is praying to the monument of the sailor praying
our lady of the shipwrecked is three times life size,
her lips sweet with divinity
she does not hear what the sailor or the peasant is saying
she is in love with the beautiful formlessness of the sea
gullcolored laces flap in the sea drafts
beside the postcard stalls
the peasants anchor them with conches one is told
these are the pretty trinkets the sea hides,
little shells made up into necklaces and toy ladies
they do not come from the bay of the dead down there,
but from another place, tropical and blue,
we have never been to
these are our crepes eat them before they blow cold

the surgeon at  am
the white light is artificial, and hygienic as heaven
the microbes cannot survive it
they are departing in their transparent garments, turned aside
from the scalpels and the rubber hands
the scalded sheet is a snowfield, frozen and peaceful
the body under it is in my hands
as usual there is no face a lump of chinese white
with seven holes thumbed in the soul is another light
i have not seen it it does not fly up
tonight it has receded like a ships light
it is a garden i have to do withtubers and fruits
oozing their jammy substances,
a mat of roots my assistants hook them back
stenches and colors assail me
this is the lungtree
these orchids are splendid they spot and coil like snakes
igi
the heart is a redbellbloom, in distress
i am so small
in comparison to these organs
i worm and hack in a purple wilderness
the blood is a sunset i admire it
i am up to my elbows in it, red and squeaking
still it seeps up, it is not exhausted
so magical a hot spring
i must seal off and let fill
the intricate, blue piping under this pale marble
how i admire the romans
aqueducts, the baths of caracalla, the eagle nose
the body is a roman thing
it has shut its mouth on the stone pill of repose
it is a statue the orderlies are wheeling off
i have perfected it
i am left with an arm or a leg,
a set of teeth, or stones
to rattle in a bottle and take home,
and tissue in slicesa pathological salami
tonight the parts are entombed in an icebox
tomorrow they will swim
in vinegar like saints relics
tomorrow the patient will have a clean, pink plastic limb
over one bed in the ward, a small blue light
announces a new soul the bed is blue
tonight, for this person, blue is a beautiful color
the angels of morphia have borne him up
he floats an inch from the ceiling,
smelling the dawn drafts
i walk among sleepers in gauze sarcophagi
the red night lights are flat moons they are dull with blood
i am the sun, in my white coat,
gray faces, shuttered by drugs, follow me like flowers

last words
i do not want a plain box, i want a sarcophagus
with tigery stripes, and a face on it
round as the moon, to stare up
i want to be looking at them when they come
picking among the dumb minerals, the roots
i see them alreadythe pale, stardistance faces
now they are nothing, they are not even babies
i imagine them without fathers or mothers, like the first gods
they will wonder if i was important
i should sugar and preserve my days like fruit
my mirror is clouding over
a few more breaths, and it will reflect nothing at all
the flowers and the faces whiten to a sheet
i do not trust the spirit it escapes like steam
in dreams, through mouthhole or eyehole i cant stop it
one day it wont come back things arent like that
they stay, their little particular lusters
warmed by much handling they almost purr
when the soles of my feet grow cold,
the blue eye of my turquoise will comfort me
let me have my copper cooking pots, let my rouge pots
bloom about me like night flowers, with a good smell
they will roll me up in bandages, they will store my heart
under my feet in a neat parcel
i shall hardly know myself it will be dark,
and the shine of these small things sweeter than the face of ishtar

the moon and the yew tree
this is the light of the mind, cold and planetary
the trees of the mind are black the light is blue
the grasses unload their griefs on my feet as if i were god,
prickling my ankles and murmuring of their humility
fumy, spiritous mists inhabit this place
igi
separated from my house by a row of headstones
i simply cannot see where there is to get to
the moon is no door it is a face in its own right,
white as a knuckle and terribly upset
it drags the sea after it like a dark crime it is quiet
with the ogape of complete despair i live here
twice on sunday, the bells startle the sky
eight great tongues affirming the resurrection
at the end, they soberly bong out their names
the yew tree points up it has a gothic shape
the eyes lift after it and find the moon
the moon is my mother she is not sweet like mary
her blue garments unloose small bats and owls
how i would like to believe in tenderness
the face of the effigy, gentled by candles,
bending, on me in particular, its mild eyes
i have fallen a long way clouds are flowering
blue and mystical over the face of the stars
inside the church, the saints will be all blue,
floating on their delicate feet over the cold pews,
their hands and faces stiff with holiness
the moon sees nothing of this she is bald and wild
and the message of the yew tree is blacknessblackness and silence

mirror
i am silver and exact i have no preconceptions
whatever i see i swallow immediately
just as it is, unmisted by love or dislike
i am not cruel, only truthful
the eye of a little god, fourcornered
most of the time i meditate on the opposite wall
it is pink, with speckles i have looked at it so long
i think it is a part of my heart but it flickers
faces and darkness separate us over and over
igi
now i am a lake a woman bends over me,
searching my reaches for what she really is
then she turns to those liars, the candles or the moon
i see her back, and reflect it faithfully
she rewards me with tears and an agitation of hands
i am important to her she comes and goes
each morning it is her face that replaces the darkness
in me she has drowned a young girl, and in me an old woman
rises toward her day after day, like a terrible fish

the babysitters
it is ten years, now, since we rowed to childrens island
the sun flamed straight down that noon on the water off marblehead
that summer we wore black glasses to hide our eyes
we were always crying, in our spare rooms, little putupon sisters,
in the two huge, white, handsome houses in swampscott
when the sweetheart from england appeared, with her cream skin and
yardley cosmetics,
i had to sleep in the same room with the baby on a tooshort cot,
and the sevenyearold wouldnt go out unless his jersey stripes
matched the stripes of his socks
o it was richnesseleven rooms and a yacht
with a polished mahogany stair to let into the water
and a cabin boy who could decorate cakes in sixcolored frosting
but i didnt know how to cook, and babies depressed me
nights, i wrote in my diary spitefully, my fingers red
with triangular scorch marks from ironing tiny ruchings and puffed
sleeves
when the sporty wife and her doctor husband went on one of their
cruises
they left me a borrowed maid named ellen, for protection,
and a small dalmatian
in your house, the main house, you were better off
you had a rose garden and a guest cottage and a model apothecary shop
igi
and a cook and a maid, and knew about the key to the bourbon
i remember you playing ja da in a pink pique dress
on the gameroom piano, when the big people were out,
and the maid smoked and shot pool under a greenshaded lamp
the cook had one wall eye and couldnt sleep, she was so nervous
on trial, from ireland, she burned batch after batch of cookies
till she was fired
what has come over us, my sister
on that dayoff the two of us cried so hard to get
we lifted a sugared ham and a pineapple from the grownups icebox
and rented an old green boat i rowed you read
aloud, crosslegged on the stern seat, from the generation of vipers
so we bobbed out to the island it was deserted
a gallery of creaking porches and still interiors,
stopped and awful as a photograph of somebody laughing,
but ten years dead
the bold gulls dove as if they owned it all
we picked up sticks of driftwood and beat them off,
then stepped down the steep beach shelf and into the water
we kicked and talked the thick salt kept us up
see us floating there yet, inseparabletwo cork dolls
what keyhole have we slipped through, what door has shut ?
the shadows of the grasses inched round like hands of a clock,
and from our opposite continents we wave and call
everything has happened

is
new year on dartmoor
this is newness every little tawdry
obstacle glasswrapped and peculiar,
glinting and clinking in a saints falsetto only you
dont know what to make of the sudden slippiness,
the blind, white, awful, inaccessible slant
theres no getting up it by the words you know
no getting up by elephant or wheel or shoe
we have only come to look you are too new
to want the world in a glass hat

three women
a poem for three voices
setting a maternity ward and round about
first voice
i am slow as the world i am very patient,
turning through my time, the suns and stars
regarding me with attention
the moons concern is more personal
she passes and repasses, luminous as a nurse
is she sorry for what will happen ? i do not think so
she is simply astonished at fertility
when i walk out, i am a great event
i do not have to think, or even rehearse
what happens in me will happen without attention
the pheasant stands on the hill
he is arranging his brown feathers
ig
i cannot help smiling at what it is i know
leaves and petals attend me i am ready
second voice
when i first saw it, the small red seep, i did not believe it
i watched the men walk about me in the office they were so flat
there was something about them like cardboard, and now i had caught it,
that flat, flat, flatness from which ideas, destructions,
bulldozers, guillotines, white chambers of shrieks proceed,
endlessly proceedand the cold angels, the abstractions
i sat at my desk in my stockings, my high heels,
and the man i work for laughed have you seen something awful ?
you are so white, suddenly and i said nothing
i saw death in the bare trees, a deprivation
i could not believe it is it so difficult
for the spirit to conceive a face, a mouth ?
the letters proceed from these black keys, and these black keys proceed
from my alphabetical fingers, ordering parts,
parts, bits, cogs, the shining multiples
i am dying as i sit i lose a dimension
trains roar in my ears, departures, departures
the silver track of time empties into the distance,
the white sky empties of its promise, like a cup
these are my feet, these mechanical echoes
tap, tap, tap, steel pegs i am found wanting
this is a disease i carry home, this is a death
again, this is a death is it the air,
the particles of destruction i suck up ? am i a pulse
that wanes and wanes, facing the cold angel ?
is this my lover then ? this death, this death ?
as a child i loved a lichenbitten name
is this the one sin then, this old dead love of death ?
third voice
i remember the minute when i knew for sure
the willows were chilling,
the face in the pool was beautiful, but not mine
it had a consequential look, like everything else,
ig
and all i could see was dangers doves and words,
stars and showers of goldconceptions, conceptions
i remember a white, cold wing
and the great swan, with its terrible look,
coming at me, like a castle, from the top of the river
there is a snake in swans
he glided by his eye had a black meaning
i saw the world in itsmall, mean and black,
every little word hooked to every little word, and act to act
a hot blue day had budded into something
i wasnt ready the white clouds rearing
aside were dragging me in four directions
i wasnt ready
i had no reverence
i thought i could deny the consequence
but it was too late for that it was too late, and the face
went on shaping itself with love, as if i was ready
second voice
it is a world of snow now i am not at home
how white these sheets are the faces have no features
they are bald and impossible, like the faces of my children,
those little sick ones that elude my arms
other children do not touch me they are terrible
they have too many colors, too much life they are not quiet,
quiet, like the little emptinesses i carry
i have had my chances i have tried and tried
i have stitched life into me like a rare organ,
and walked carefully, precariously, like something rare
i have tried not to think too hard i have tried to be natural
i have tried to be blind in love, like other women,
blind in my bed, with my dear blind sweet one,
not looking, through the thick dark, for the face of another
i did not look but still the face was there,
the face of the unborn one that loved its perfections,
the face of the dead one that could only be perfect
in its easy peace, could only keep holy so
ig
and then there were other faces the faces of nations,
governments, parliaments, societies,
the faceless faces of important men
it is these men i mind
they are so jealous of anything that is not flat they are jealous gods
that would have the whole world flat because they are
i see the father conversing with the son
such flatness cannot but be holy
let us make a heaven, they say
let us flatten and launder the grossness from these souls
first voice
i am calm i am calm it is the calm before something awful
the yellow minute before the wind walks, when the leaves
turn up their hands, their pallors it is so quiet here
the sheets, the faces, are white and stopped, like clocks
voices stand back and flatten their visible hieroglyphs
flatten to parchment screens to keep the wind off
they paint such secrets in arabic, chinese
i am dumb and brown i am a seed about to break
the brownness is my dead self, and it is sullen
it does not wish to be more, or different
dusk hoods me in blue now, like a mary
color of distance and forgetfulness
when will it be, the second when time breaks
and eternity engulfs it, and i drown utterly ?
talk to myself, myself only, set apart
swabbed and lurid with disinfectants, sacrificial
waiting lies heavy on my lids it lies like sleep,
like a big sea far off, far off, i feel the first wave tug
its cargo of agony toward me, inescapable, tidal
and i, a shell, echoing on this white beach
face the voices that overwhelm, the terrible element
third voice
i am a mountain now, among mountainy women
the doctors move among us as if our bigness
frightened the mind they smile like fools
ig
they are to blame for what i am, and they know it
they hug their flatness like a kind of health
and what if they found themselves surprised, as i did ?
they would go mad with it
and what if two lives leaked between my thighs ?
i have seen the white clean chamber with its instruments
it is a place of shrieks it is not happy
this is where you will come when you are ready
the night lights are flat red moons they are dull with blood
i am not ready for anything to happen
i should have murdered this, that murders me
first voice
there is no miracle more cruel than this
i am dragged by the horses, the iron hooves
i last i last it out i accomplish a work
dark tunnel, through which hurtle the visitations,
the visitations, the manifestations, the startled faces
i am the center of an atrocity
what pains, what sorrows must i be mothering ?
can such innocence kill and kill ? it milks my life
the trees wither in the street the rain is corrosive
i taste it on my tongue, and the workable horrors,
the horrors that stand and idle, the slighted godmothers
with their hearts that tick and tick, with their satchels of instruments
i shall be a wall and a roof, protecting
i shall be a sky and a hill of good o let me be
a power is growing on me, an old tenacity
i am breaking apart like the world there is this blackness,
this ram of blackness i fold my hands on a mountain
the air is thick it is thick with this working
i am used i am drummed into use
my eyes are squeezed by this blackness
i see nothing
second voice
i am accused i dream of massacres
i am a garden of black and red agonies i drink them,
ig
hating myself, hating and fearing and now the world conceives
its end and runs toward it, arms held out in love
it is a love of death that sickens everything
a dead sun stains the newsprint it is red
i lose life after life the dark earth drinks them
she is the vampire of us all so she supports us,
fattens us, is kind her mouth is red
i know her i know her intimately
old winterface, old barren one, old time bomb
men have used her meanly she will eat them
eat them, eat them, eat them in the end
the sun is down i die i make a death
first voice
who is he, this blue, furious boy,
shiny and strange, as if he had hurtled from a star?
he is looking so angrily
he flew into the room, a shriek at his heel
the blue color pales he is human after all
a red lotus opens in its bowl of blood
they are stitching me up with silk, as if i were a material
what did my fingers do before they held him ?
what did my heart do, with its love ?
i have never seen a thing so clear
his lids are like the lilacflower
and soft as a moth, his breath
i shall not let go
there is no guile or warp in him may he keep so
second voice
there is the moon in the high window it is over
how winter fills my soul and that chalk light
laying its scales on the windows, the windows of empty offices,
empty schoolrooms, empty churches o so much emptiness
there is this cessation this terrible cessation of everything
these bodies mounded around me now, these polar sleepers
what blue, moony ray ices their dreams ?
ig
i feel it enter me, cold, alien, like an instrument
and that mad, hard face at the end of it, that omouth
open in its gape of perpetual grieving
it is she that drags the bloodblack sea around
month after month, with its voices of failure
i am helpless as the sea at the end of her string
i am restless restless and useless i, too, create corpses
i shall move north i shall move into a long blackness
i see myself as a shadow, neither man nor woman,
neither a woman, happy to be like a man, nor a man
blunt and flat enough to feel no lack i feel a lack
i hold my fingers up, ten white pickets
see, the darkness is leaking from the cracks
i cannot contain it i cannot contain my life
i shall be a heroine of the peripheral
i shall not be accused by isolate buttons,
holes in the heels of socks, the white mute faces
of unanswered letters, coffined in a letter case
i shall not be accused, i shall not be accused
the clock shall not find me wanting, nor these stars
that rivet in place abyss after abyss
third voice
i see her in my sleep, my red, terrible girl
she is crying through the glass that separates us
she is crying, and she is furious
her cries are hooks that catch and grate like cats
it is by these hooks she climbs to my notice
she is crying at the dark, or at the stars
that at such a distance from us shine and whirl
i think her little head is carved in wood,
a red, hard wood, eyes shut and mouth wide open
and from the open mouth issue sharp cries
scratching at my sleep like arrows,
scratching at my sleep, and entering my side
my daughter has no teeth her mouth is wide
it utters such dark sounds it cannot be good

what is it that flings these innocent souls at us ?
look, they are so exhausted, they are all flat out
in their canvassided cots, names tied to their wrists,
the little silver trophies theyve come so far for
there are some with thick black hair, there are some bald
their skin tints are pink or sallow, brown or red
they are beginning to remember their differences
i think they are made of water they have no expression
their features are sleeping, like light on quiet water
they are the real monks and nuns in their identical garments
i see them showering like stars on to the world
on india, africa, america, these miraculous ones,
these pure, small images they smell of milk
their footsoles are untouched they are walkers of air
can nothingness be so prodigal ?
here is my son
his wide eye is that general, flat blue
he is turning to me like a little, blind, bright plant
one cry it is the hook i hang on
and i am a river of milk
i am a warm hill
second voice
i am not ugly i am even beautiful
the mirror gives back a woman without deformity
the nurses give back my clothes, and an identity
it is usual, they say, for such a thing to happen
it is usual in my life, and the lives of others
i am one in five, something like that i am not hopeless
i am beautiful as a statistic here is my lipstick
i draw on the old mouth
the red mouth i put by with my identity
a day ago, two days, three days ago it was a friday
i do not even need a holiday i can go to work today
i can love my husband, who will understand
who will love me through the blur of my deformity
as if i had lost an eye, a leg, a tongue
ig
and so i stand, a little sightless so i walk
away on wheels, instead of legs, they serve as well
and learn to speak with fingers, not a tongue
the body is resourceful
the body of a starfish can grow back its arms
and newts are prodigal in legs and may i be
as prodigal in what lacks me
third voice
she is a small island, asleep and peaceful,
and i am a white ship hooting goodbye, goodbye
the day is blazing it is very mournful
the flowers in this room are red and tropical
they have lived behind glass all their lives, they have been cared for
tenderly
now they face a winter of white sheets, white faces
there is very little to go into my suitcase
there are the clothes of a fat woman i do not know
there is my comb and brush there is an emptiness
i am so vulnerable suddenly
i am a wound walking out of hospital
i am a wound that they are letting go
i leave my health behind i leave someone
who would adhere to me i undo her fingers like bandages i go
second voice
i am myself again there are no loose ends
i am bled white as wax, i have no attachments
i am flat and virginal, which means nothing has happened,
nothing that cannot be erased, ripped up and scrapped, begun again
these little black twigs do not think to bud,
nor do these dry, dry gutters dream of rain
this woman who meets me in windowsshe is neat
so neat she is transparent, like a spirit
how shyly she superimposes her neat self
on the inferno of african oranges, the heelhung pigs
she is deferring to reality
it is i it is i
tasting the bitterness between my teeth
the incalculable malice of the everyday

how long can i be a wall, keeping the wind off?
how long can i be
gentling the sun with the shade of my hand,
intercepting the blue bolts of a cold moon?
the voices of loneliness, the voices of sorrow
lap at my back ineluctably
how shall it soften them, this little lullaby ?
how long can i be a wall around my green property ?
how long can my hands
be a bandage to his hurt, and my words
bright birds in the sky, consoling, consoling ?
it is a terrible thing
to be so open it is as if my heart
put on a face and walked into the world
third voice
today the colleges are drunk with spring
my black gown is a little funeral
it shows i am serious
the books i carry wedge into my side
i had an old wound once, but it is healing
i had a dream of an island, red with cries
it was a dream, and did not mean a thing
first voice
dawn flowers in the great elm outside the house
the swifts are back they are shrieking like paper rockets
i hear the sound of the hours
widen and die in the hedgerows i hear the moo of cows
the colors replenish themselves, and the wet
thatch smokes in the sun
the narcissi open white faces in the orchard
i am reassured i am reassured
these are the clear bright colors of the nursery,
the talking ducks, the happy lambs
i am simple again i believe in miracles
i do not believe in those terrible children
who injure my sleep with their white eyes, their fingerless hands
they are not mine they do not belong to me
iq
i shall meditate upon normality
i shall meditate upon my little son
he does not walk he does not speak a word
he is still swaddled in white bands
but he is pink and perfect he smiles so frequently
i have papered his room with big roses,
i have painted little hearts on everything
i do not will him to be exceptional
it is the exception that interests the devil
it is the exception that climbs the sorrowful hill
or sits in the desert and hurts his mothers heart
i will him to be common,
to love me as i love him,
and to marry what he wants and where he will
third voice
hot noon in the meadows the buttercups
swelter and melt, and the lovers
pass by, pass by
they are black and flat as shadows
it is so beautiful to have no attachments
i am solitary as grass what is it i miss?
shall i ever find it, whatever it is ?
the swans are gone still the river
remembers how white they were
it strives after them with its lights
it finds their shapes in a cloud
what is that bird that cries
with such sorrow in its voice ?
i am young as ever, it says what is it i miss?
second voice
i am at home in the lamplight the evenings are lengthening
i am mending a silk slip my husband is reading
how beautifully the light includes these things
there is a kind of smoke in the spring air,
a smoke that takes the parks, the little statues
with pinkness, as if a tenderness awoke,
a tenderness that did not tire, something healing
iq
i wait and ache i think i have been healing
there is a great deal else to do my hands
can stitch lace neatly on to this material my husband
can turn and turn the pages of a book
and so we are at home together, after hours
it is only time that weighs upon our hands
it is only time, and that is not material
the streets may turn to paper suddenly, but i recover
from the long fall, and find myself in bed,
safe on the mattress, hands braced, as for a fall
i find myself again i am no shadow
though there is a shadow starting from my feet i am a wife
the city waits and aches the little grasses
crack through stone, and they are green with life

little fugue
the yews black fingers wag
cold clouds go over
so the deaf and dumb
signal the blind, and are ignored
i like black statements
the featurelessness of that cloud, now
white as an eye all over
the eye of the blind pianist
at my table on the ship
he felt for his food
his fingers had the noses of weasels
i couldnt stop looking
he could hear beethoven
black yew, white cloud,
the horrific complications
fingertrapsa tumult of keys
ig
empty and silly as plates,
so the blind smile
i envy the big noises,
the yew hedge of the grosse fuge
deafness is something else
such a dark funnel, my father
i see your voice
black and leafy, as in my childhood,
a yew hedge of orders,
gothic and barbarous, pure german
dead men cry from it
i am guilty of nothing
the yew my christ, then
is it not as tortured ?
and you, during the great war
in the california delicatessen
lopping the sausages
they color my sleep,
red, mottled, like cut necks
there was a silence
great silence of another order
i was seven, i knew nothing
the world occurred
you had one leg, and a prussian mind
now similar clouds
are spreading their vacuous sheets
do you say nothing ?
i am lame in the memory
i remember a blue eye,
a briefcase of tangerines
this was a man, then
death opened, like a black tree, blackly
ig
i survive the while,
arranging my morning
these are my fingers, this my baby
the clouds are a marriage dress, of that pallor
april ig
an appearance
the smile of iceboxes annihilates me
such blue currents in the veins of my loved one
i hear her great heart purr
from her lips ampersands and percent signs
exit like kisses
it is monday in her mind morals
launder and present themselves
what am i to make of these contradictions ?
i wear white cuffs, i bow
is this love then, this red material
issuing from the steel needle that flies so blindingly ?
it will make little dresses and coats,
it will cover a dynasty
how her body opens and shuts
a swiss watch, jeweled in the hinges
o heart, such disorganization
the stars are flashing like terrible numerals
abc, her eyelids say

crossing the water
black lake, black boat, two black, cutpaper people
where do the black trees go that drink here ?
their shadows must cover canada
a little light is filtering from the water flowers
their leaves do not wish us to hurry
they are round and flat and full of dark advice
cold worlds shake from the oar
the spirit of blackness is in us, it is in the fishes
a snag is lifting a valedictory, pale hand
stars open among the lilies
are you not blinded by such expressionless sirens ?
this is the silence of astounded souls
april ig
among the narcissi
spry, wry, and gray as these march sticks,
percy bows, in his blue peajacket, among the narcissi
he is recuperating from something on the lung
the narcissi, too, are bowing to some big thing
it rattles their stars on the green hill where percy
nurses the hardship of his stitches, and walks and walks
there is a dignity to this there is a formality
the flowers vivid as bandages, and the man mending
they bow and stand they suffer such attacks
and the octogenarian loves the little flocks
he is quite blue the terrible wind tries his breathing
the narcissi look up like children, quickly and whitely

pheasant
you said you would kill it this morning
do not kill it it startles me still,
the jut of that odd, dark head, pacing
through the uncut grass on the elms hill
it is something to own a pheasant,
or just to be visited at all
i am not mystical it isnt
as if i thought it had a spirit
it is simply in its element
that gives it a kingliness, a right
the print of its big foot last winter,
the tailtrack, on the snow in our court
the wonder of it, in that pallor,
through crosshatch of sparrow and starling
is it its rareness, then ? it is rare
but a dozen would be worth having,
a hundred, on that hillgreen and red,
crossing and recrossing a fine thing
it is such a good shape, so vivid
its a little cornucopia
it unclaps, brown as a leaf, and loud,
settles in the elm, and is easy
it was sunning in the narcissi
i trespass stupidly let be, let be

for ruth fainlight
i know the bottom, she says i know it with my great tap root
it is what you fear
i do not fear it i have been there
is it the sea you hear in me,
its dissatisfactions ?
or the voice of nothing, that was your madness?
love is a shadow
how you lie and cry after it
listen these are its hooves it has gone off, like a horse
all night i shall gallop thus, impetuously,
till your head is a stone, your pillow a little turf,
echoing, echoing
or shall i bring you the sound of poisons ?
this is rain now, this big hush
and this is the fruit of it tinwhite, like arsenic
i have suffered the atrocity of sunsets
scorched to the root
my red filaments burn and stand, a hand of wires
now i break up in pieces that fly about like clubs
a wind of such violence
will tolerate no bystanding i must shriek
the moon, also, is merciless she would drag me
cruelly, being barren
her radiance scathes me or perhaps i have caught her
i let her go i let her go
diminished and flat, as after radical surgery
how your bad dreams possess and endow me
ig
i am inhabited by a cry
nightly it flaps out
looking, with its hooks, for something to love
i am terrified by this dark thing
that sleeps in me
all day i feel its soft, feathery turnings, its malignity
clouds pass and disperse
are those the faces of love, those pale irretrievables ?
is it for such i agitate my heart ?
i am incapable of more knowledge
what is this, this face
so murderous in its strangle of branches ?
its snaky acids kiss
it petrifies the will these are the isolate, slow faults
that kill, that kill, that kill

the rabbit catcher
it was a place of force
the wind gagging my mouth with my own blown hair,
tearing off my voice, and the sea
blinding me with its lights, the lives of the dead
unreeling in it, spreading like oil
i tasted the malignity of the gorse,
its black spikes,
the extreme unction of its yellow candleflowers
they had an efficiency, a great beauty,
and were extravagant, like torture
there was only one place to get to
simmering, perfumed,
the paths narrowed into the hollow
ig
and the snares almost effaced themselves
zeros, shutting on nothing,
set close, like birth pangs
the absence of shrieks
made a hole in the hot day, a vacancy
the glassy light was a clear wall,
the thickets quiet
i felt a still busyness, an intent
i felt hands round a tea mug, dull, blunt,
ringing the white china
how they awaited him, those little deaths
they waited like sweethearts they excited him
and we, too, had a relationship
tight wires between us,
pegs too deep to uproot, and a mind like a ring
sliding shut on some quick thing,
the constriction killing me also
may ig

event
how the elements solidify
the moonlight, that chalk cliff
in whose rift we lie
back to back i hear an owl cry
from its cold indigo
intolerable vowels enter my heart
the child in the white crib revolves and sighs,
opens its mouth now, demanding
his little face is carved in pained, red wood
then there are the starsineradicable, hard
one touch it burns and sickens
i cannot see your eyes
iq
where apple bloom ices the night
i walk in a ring,
a groove of old faults, deep and bitter
love cannot come here
a black gap discloses itself
on the opposite lip
a small white soul is waving, a small white maggot
my limbs, also, have left me
who has dismembered us ?
the dark is melting we touch like cripples
may ig

there is this white wall, above which the sky creates itself
infinite, green, utterly untouchable
angels swim in it, and the stars, in indifference also
they are my medium
the sun dissolves on this wall, bleeding its lights
a gray wall now, clawed and bloody
is there no way out of the mind ?
steps at my back spiral into a well
there are no trees or birds in this world,
there is only a sourness
this red wall winces continually
a red fist, opening and closing,
two gray, papery bags
this is what i am made of, this and a terror
of being wheeled off under crosses and a rain of pietas
on a black wall, unidentifiable birds
swivel their heads and cry
ig
there is no talk of immortality among these
cold blanks approach us
they move in a hurry

this is the sea, then, this great abeyance
how the suns poultice draws on my inflammation
electrifyinglycolored sherbets, scooped from the freeze
by pale girls, travel the air in scorched hands
why is it so quiet, what are they hiding ?
i have two legs, and i move smilingly
a sandy damper kills the vibrations
it stretches for miles, the shrunk voices
waving and crutchless, half their old size
the lines of the eye, scalded by these bald surfaces,
boomerang like anchored elastics, hurting the owner
is it any wonder he puts on dark glasses ?
is it any wonder he affects a black cassock ?
here he comes now, among the mackerel gatherers
who wall up their backs against him
they are handling the black and green lozenges like the parts of a body
the sea, that crystallized these,
creeps away, manysnaked, with a long hiss of distress
ig

this black boot has no mercy for anybody
why should it, it is the hearse of a dead foot,
the high, dead, toeless foot of this priest
who plumbs the well of his book,
the bent print bulging before him like scenery
obscene bikinis hide in the dunes,
breasts and hips a confectioners sugar
of little crystals, titillating the light,
while a green pool opens its eye,
sick with what it has swallowed
limbs, images, shrieks behind the concrete bunkers
two lovers unstick themselves
o white seacrockery,
what cupped sighs, what salt in the throat
and the onlooker, trembling,
drawn like a long material
through a still virulence,
and a weed, hairy as privates

on the balconies of the hotel, things are glittering
things, things
tubular steel wheelchairs, aluminum crutches
such saltsweetness why should i walk
beyond the breakwater, spotty with barnacles ?
i am not a nurse, white and attendant,
ig
i am not a smile
these children are after something, with hooks and cries,
and my heart too small to bandage their terrible faults
this is the side of a man his red ribs,
the nerves bursting like trees, and this is the surgeon
one mirrory eye
a facet of knowledge
on a striped mattress in one room
an old man is vanishing
there is no help in his weeping wife
where are the eyestones, yellow and valuable,
and the tongue, sapphire of ash

a weddingcake face in a paper frill
how superior he is now
it is like possessing a saint
the nurses in their wingcaps are no longer so beautiful
they are browning, like touched gardenias
the bed is rolled from the wall
this is what it is to be complete it is horrible
is he wearing pajamas or an evening suit
under the glued sheet from which his powdery beak
rises so whitely unbuffeted ?
they propped his jaw with a book until it stiffened
and folded his hands, that were shaking goodbye, goodbye
now the washed sheets fly in the sun,
the pillow cases are sweetening
ig
it is a blessing, it is a blessing
the long coffin of soapcolored oak,
the curious bearers and the raw date
engraving itself in silver with marvelous calm

the gray sky lowers, the hills like a green sea
run fold upon fold far off, concealing their hollows,
the hollows in which rock the thoughts of the wife
blunt, practical boats
full of dresses and hats and china and married daughters
in the parlor of the stone house
one curtain is flickering from the open window,
flickering and pouring, a pitiful candle
this is the tongue of the dead man remember, remember
how far he is now, his actions
around him like livingroom furniture, like a decor
as the pallors gather
the pallors of hands and neighborly faces,
the elate pallors of flying iris
they are flying off into nothing remember us
the empty benches of memory look over stones,
marble facades with blue veins, and jellyglassfuls of daffodils
it is so beautiful up here it is a stopping place

the natural fatness of these lime leaves
pollarded green balls, the trees march to church

the voice of the priest, in thin air,
meets the corpse at the gate,
addressing it, while the hills roll the notes of the dead bell
a glitter of wheat and crude earth
what is the name of that color ?
old blood of caked walls the sun heals,
old blood of limb stumps, burnt hearts
the widow with her black pocketbook and three daughters,
necessary among the flowers,
enfolds her face like fine linen,
not to be spread again
while a sky, wormy with putby smiles,
passes cloud after cloud
and the bride flowers expend a freshness,
and the soul is a bride
in a still place, and the groom is red and forgetful, he is featureless
?
behind the glass of this car
the world purrs, shutoff and gentle
and i am darksuited and still, a member of the party,
gliding up in low gear behind the cart
and the priest is a vessel,
a tarred fabric, sorry and dull,
following the coffin on its flowery cart like a beautiful woman,
a crest of breasts, eyelids and lips
storming the hilltop
then, from the barred yard, the children
iq
smell the melt of shoeblacking,
their faces turning, wordless and slow,
their eyes opening
on a wonderful thing
six round black hats in the grass and a lozenge of wood,
and a naked mouth, red and awkward
for a minute the sky pours into the hole like plasma
there is no hope, it is given up

sulfurous adulteries grieve in a dream

an effect, a cosmetic

and it exhausts me to watch you
flickering like that, wrinkly and clear red, like the skin of a mouth
a mouth just bloodied
little bloody skirts
there are fumes that i cannot touch
where are your opiates, your nauseous capsules ?
if i could bleed, or sleep
if my mouth could marry a hurt like that
or your liquors seep to me, in this glass capsule,

burning the letters
i made a fire being tired
of the white fists of old
letters and their death rattle
when i came too close to the wastebasket
what did they know that i didnt?
grain by grain, they unrolled
sands where a dream of clear water
grinned like a getaway car
i am not subtle
love, love, and well, i was tired
of cardboard cartons the color of cement or a dog pack
holding in its hate
dully, under a pack of men in red jackets,
and the eyes and times of the postmarks
this fire may lick and fawn, but it is merciless
a glass case
my fingers would enter although
they melt and sag, they are told
do not touch
and here is an end to the writing,
the spry hooks that bend and cringe, and the smiles, the smiles
and at least it will be a good place now, the attic
at least i wont be strung just under the surface,
dumb fish
with one tin eye,
watching for glints,
riding my arctic
between this wish and that wish
so i poke at the carbon birds in my housedress
they are more beautiful than my bodiless owl,
they console me
rising and flying, but blinded
they would flutter off, black and glittering, they would be coal an
only they have nothing to say to anybody
i have seen to that
with the butt of a rake
i flake up papers that breathe like people,
ig
i fan them out
between the yellow lettuces and the german cabbage
involved in its weird blue dreams,
involved as a foetus
and a name with black edges
wilts at my foot,
sinuous orchis
in a nest of roothairs and boredom
pale eyes, patentleather gutturals
warm rain greases my hair, extinguishes nothing
my veins glow like trees
the dogs are tearing a fox this is what it is like
a red burst and a cry
that splits from its ripped bag and does not stop
with the dead eye
and the stuffed expression, but goes on
dyeing the air,
telling the particles of the clouds, the leaves, the water
what immortality is that it is immortal

growing beside you, like a tree,
a death tree, color gone, an australian gum tree
balding, gelded by lightningan illusion,

but right now you are dumb

a birthday present
what is this, behind this veil, is it ugly, is it beautiful ?
it is shimmering, has it breasts, has it edges ?
i am sure it is unique, i am sure it is just what i want
when i am quiet at my cooking i feel it looking, i feel it thinking
is this the one i am to appear for,
is this the elect one, the one with black eyepits and a scar?
measuring the flour, cutting off the surplus,
adhering to rules, to rules, to rules
is this the one for the annunciation ?
my god, what a laugh
but it shimmers, it does not stop, and i think it wants me
i would not mind if it was bones, or a pearl button
i do not want much of a present, anyway, this year
after all i am alive only by accident
i would have killed myself gladly that time any possible way
now there are these veils, shimmering like curtains,
the diaphanous satins of a january window
white as babies bedding and glittering with dead breath o ivory
it must be a tusk there, a ghostcolumn
can you not see i do not mind what it is
can you not give it to me ?
do not be ashamedi do not mind if it is small
iq
do not be mean, i am ready for enormity
let us sit down to it, one on either side, admiring the gleam,
the glaze, the mirrory variety of it
let us eat our last supper at it, like a hospital plate
i know why you will not give it to me,
you are terrified
the world will go up in a shriek, and your head with it,
bossed, brazen, an antique shield,
a marvel to your greatgrandchildren
do not be afraid, it is not so
i will only take it and go aside quietly
you will not even hear me opening it, no paper crackle,
no falling ribbons, no scream at the end
i do not think you credit me with this discretion
if you only knew how the veils were killing my days
to you they are only transparencies, clear air
but my god, the clouds are like cotton
armies of them they are carbon monoxide
sweetly, sweetly i breathe in,
filling my veins with invisibles, with the million
probable motes that tick the years off my life
you are silversuited for the occasion o adding machine
is it impossible for you to let something go and have it go whole ?
must you stamp each piece in purple,
must you kill what you can ?
there is this one thing i want today, and only you can give it to me
it stands at my window, big as the sky
it breathes from my sheets, the cold dead center
ig
where spilt lives congeal and stiffen to history
let it not come by the mail, finger by finger
let it not come by word of mouth, i should be sixty
by the time the whole of it was delivered, and too numb to use it
only let down the veil, the veil, the veil
if it were death
i would admire the deep gravity of it, its timeless eyes
i would know you were serious
there would be a nobility then, there would be a birthday
and the knife not carve, but enter
pure and clean as the cry of a baby,
and the universe slide from my side
j o september ig
the detective
what was she doing when it blew in
over the seven hills, the red furrow, the blue mountain ?
was she arranging cups ? it is important
was she at the window, listening ?
in that valley the train shrieks echo like souls on hooks
that is the valley of death, though the cows thrive
in her garden the lies were shaking out their moist silks
and the eyes of the killer moving sluglike and sidelong,
unable to face the fingers, those egotists
the fingers were tamping a woman into a wall,
a body into a pipe, and the smoke rising
this is the smell of years burning, here in the kitchen,
these are the deceits, tacked up like family photographs,
and this is a man, look at his smile,
the death weapon? no one is dead
ig
there is no body in the house at all
there is the smell of polish, there are plush carpets
there is the sunlight, playing its blades,
bored hoodlum in a red room
where the wireless talks to itself like an elderly relative
did it come like an arrow, did it come like a knife ?
which of the poisons is it?
which of the nervecurlers, the convulsors? did it electrify?
this is a case without a body
the body does not come into it at all
it is a case of vaporization
the mouth first, its absence reported
in the second year it had been insatiable
and in punishment was hung out like brown fruit
to wrinkle and dry
the breasts next
these were harder, two white stones
the milk came yellow, then blue and sweet as water
there was no absence of lips, there were two children,
but their bones showed, and the moon smiled
then the dry wood, the gates,
the brown motherly furrows, the whole estate
we walk on air, watson
there is only the moon, embalmed in phosphorus
there is only a crow in a tree make notes
october ig
the courage of shuttingup
the courage of the shut mouth, in spite of artillery
the line pink and quiet, a worm, basking
there are black disks behind it, the disks of outrage,
and the outrage of a sky, the lined brain of it
the disks revolve, they ask to be heard
ig
loaded, as they are, with accounts of bastardies
bastardies, usages, desertions and doubleness,
the needle journeying in its groove,
silver beast between two dark canyons,
a great surgeon, now a tattooist,
tattooing over and over the same blue grievances,
the snakes, the babies, the tits
on mermaids and twolegged dreamgirls
the surgeon is quiet, he does not speak
he has seen too much death, his hands are full of it
so the disks of the brain revolve, like the muzzles of cannon
then there is that antique billhook, the tongue,
indefatigable, purple must it be cut out ?
it has nine tails, it is dangerous
and the noise it flays from the air, once it gets going
no, the tongue, too, has been put by,
hung up in the library with the engravings of rangoon
and the fox heads, the otter heads, the heads of dead rabbits
it is a marvelous object
the things it has pierced in its time
but how about the eyes, the eyes, the eyes ?
mirrors can kill and talk, they are terrible rooms
in which a torture goes on one can only watch
the face that lived in this mirror is the face of a dead man
do not worry about the eyes
they may be white and shy, they are no stool pigeons,
their death rays folded like flags
of a country no longer heard of,
an obstinate independency
insolvent among the mountains

the bee meeting
who are these people at the bridge to meet me ? they are the
villagers
the rector, the midwife, the sexton, the agent for bees
in my sleeveless summery dress i have no protection,
and they are all gloved and covered, why did nobody tell me?
they are smiling and taking out veils tacked to ancient hats
i am nude as a chicken neck, does nobody love me ?
yes, here is the secretary of bees with her white shop smock,
buttoning the cuffs at my wrists and the slit from my neck to my knees
now i am milkweed silk, the bees will not notice
they will not smell my fear, my fear, my fear
which is the rector now, is it that man in black ?
which is the midwife, is that her blue coat?
everybody is nodding a square black head, they are knights in visors,
breastplates of cheesecloth knotted under the armpits
their smiles and their voices are changing i am led through a beanfield
strips of tinfoil winking like people,
feather dusters fanning their hands in a sea of bean flowers,
creamy bean flowers with black eyes and leaves like bored hearts
is it blood clots the tendrils are dragging up that string ?
no, no, it is scarlet flowers that will one day be edible
now they are giving me a fashionable white straw italian hat
and a black veil that molds to my face, they are making me one of them
they are leading me to the shorn grove, the circle of hives
is it the hawthorn that smells so sick ?
the barren body of hawthorn, etherizing its children
is it some operation that is taking place ?
it is the surgeon my neighbors are waiting for,
this apparition in a green helmet,
shining gloves and white suit
is it the butcher, the grocer, the postman, someone i know?
i cannot run, i am rooted, and the gorse hurts me
with its yellow purses, its spiky armory
ig
i could not run without having to run forever
the white hive is snug as a virgin,
sealing off her brood cells, her honey, and quietly humming
smoke rolls and scarves in the grove
the mind of the hive thinks this is the end of everything
here they come, the outriders, on their hysterical elastics
if i stand very still, they will think i am cowparsley,
a gullible head untouched by their animosity,
not even nodding, a personage in a hedgerow
the villagers open the chambers, they are hunting the queen
is she hiding, is she eating honey ? she is very clever
she is old, old, old, she must live another year, and she knows it
while in their fingerjoint cells the new virgins
dream of a duel they will win inevitably,
a curtain of wax dividing them from the bride flight,
the upflight of the murderess into a heaven that loves her
the villagers are moving the virgins, there will be no killing
the old queen does not show herself, is she so ungrateful ?
i am exhausted, i am exhausted
pillar of white in a blackout of knives
i am the magicians girl who does not flinch
the villagers are untying their disguises, they are shaking hands
whose is that long white box in the grove, what have they accomplished,
why am i cold
j october ig
the arrival of the bee box
i ordered this, this clean wood box
square as a chair and almost too heavy to lift
i would say it was the coffin of a midget
or a square baby
were there not such a din in it
ig
the box is locked, it is dangerous
i have to live with it overnight
and i cant keep away from it
there are no windows, so i cant see what is in there
there is only a little grid, no exit
i put my eye to the grid
it is dark, dark,
with the swarmy feeling of african hands
minute and shrunk for export,
black on black, angrily clambering
how can i let them out ?
it is the noise that appalls me most of all,
the unintelligible syllables
it is like a roman mob,
small, taken one by one, but my god, together
i lay my ear to furious latin
i am not a caesar
i have simply ordered a box of maniacs
they can be sent back
they can die, i need feed them nothing, i am the owner
i wonder how hungry they are
i wonder if they would forget me
if i just undid the locks and stood back and turned into a tree
there is the laburnum, its blond colonnades,
and the petticoats of the cherry
they might ignore me immediately
in my moon suit and funeral veil
i am no source of honey
so why should they turn on me ?
tomorrow i will be sweet god, i will set them free
the box is only temporary
october iq
i go
stings
barehanded, i hand the combs
the man in white smiles, barehanded,
our cheesecloth gauntlets neat and sweet,
the throats of our wrists brave lilies
he and i
have a thousand clean cells between us,
eight combs of yellow cups,
and the hive itself a teacup,
white with pink flowers on it,
with excessive love i enameled it
thinking sweetness, sweetness
brood cells gray as the fossils of shells
terrify me, they seem so old
what am i buying, wormy mahogany ?
is there any queen at all in it ?
if there is, she is old,
her wings torn shawls, her long body
rubbed of its plush
poor and bare and unqueenly and even shameful
i stand in a column
of winged, unmiraculous women,
honeydrudgers
i am no drudge
though for years i have eaten dust
and dried plates with my dense hair
and seen my strangeness evaporate,
blue dew from dangerous skin
will they hate me,
these women who only scurry,
whose news is the open cherry, the open clover ?
it is almost over
i am in control
here is my honeymachine,
iq
it will work without thinking,
opening, in spring, like an industrious virgin
to scour the creaming crests
as the moon, for its ivory powders, scours the sea
a third person is watching
he has nothing to do with the beeseller or with me
now he is gone
in eight great bounds, a great scapegoat
here is his slipper, here is another,
and here the square of white linen
he wore instead of a hat
he was sweet,
the sweat of his efforts a rain
tugging the world to fruit
the bees found him out,
molding onto his lips like lies,
complicating his features
they thought death was worth it, but i
have a self to recover, a queen
is she dead, is she sleeping ?
where has she been,
with her lionred body, her wings of glass ?
now she is flying
more terrible than she ever was, red
scar in the sky, red comet
over the engine that killed her
the mausoleum, the wax house

the swarm
somebody is shooting at something in our town
a dull pom, pom in the sunday street
jealousy can open the blood,
iq
it can make black roses
who are they shooting at?
it is you the knives are out for
at waterloo, waterloo, napoleon,
the hump of elba on your short back,
and the snow, marshaling its brilliant cutlery
mass after mass, saying shh
shh these are chess people you play with,
still figures of ivory
the mud squirms with throats,
stepping stones for french bootsoles
the gilt and pink domes of russia melt and float off
in the furnace of greed clouds, clouds
so the swarm balls and deserts
seventy feet up, in a black pine tree
it must be shot down pom pom
so dumb it thinks bullets are thunder
it thinks they are the voice of god
condoning the beak, the claw, the grin of the dog
yellowhaunched, a packdog,
grinning over its bone of ivory
like the pack, the pack, like everybody
the bees have got so far seventy feet high
russia, poland and germany
the mild hills, the same old magenta
fields shrunk to a penny
spun into a river, the river crossed
the bees argue, in their black ball,
a flying hedgehog, all prickles
the man with gray hands stands under the honeycomb
of their dream, the hived station
where trains, faithful to their steel arcs,
ig
leave and arrive, and there is no end to the country
pom pom they fall
dismembered, to a tod of ivy
so much for the charioteers, the outriders, the grand army
a red tatter, napoleon
the last badge of victory
the swarm is knocked into a cocked straw hat
elba, elba, bleb on the sea
the white busts of marshals, admirals, generals
worming themselves into niches
how instructive this is
the dumb, banded bodies
walking the plank draped with mother frances upholstery
into a new mausoleum,
an ivory palace, a crotch pine
the man with gray hands smiles
the smile of a man of business, intensely practical
they are not hands at all
but asbestos receptacles
pom pom they would have killed me
stings big as drawing pins
it seems bees have a notion of honor,
a black intractable mind
napoleon is pleased, he is pleased with everything
o europe o ton of honey

wintering
this is the easy time, there is nothing doing
i have whirled the midwifes extractor,
i have my honey,
six jars of it,
six cats eyes in the wine cellar,
iq
wintering in a dark without window
at the heart of the house
next to the last tenants rancid jam
and the bottles of empty glitters
sir soandsos gin
this is the room i have never been in
this is the room i could never breathe in
the black bunched in there like a bat,
no light
but the torch and its faint
chinese yellow on appalling objects
black asininity decay
possession
it is they who own me
neither cruel nor indifferent,
only ignorant
this is the time of hanging on for the beesthe bees
so slow i hardly know them,
filing like soldiers
to the syrup tin
to make up for the honey ive taken
tate and lyle keeps them going,
the refined snow
it is tate and lyle they live on, instead of flowers
they take it the cold sets in
now they ball in a mass,
black
mind against all that white
the smile of the snow is white
it spreads itself out, a milelong body of meissen,
into which, on warm days,
they can only carry their dead
the bees are all women,
maids and the long royal lady
they have got rid of the men,
ig
the blunt, clumsy stumblers, the boors
winter is for women
the woman, still at her knitting,
at the cradle of spanish walnut,
her body a bulb in the cold and too dumb to think
will the hive survive, will the gladiolas
succeed in banking their fires
to enter another year ?
what will they taste of, the christmas roses ?
the bees are flying they taste the spring

holding up one palm
a difference between us ?
i have one eye, you have two
the secret is stamped on you,
faint, undulant watermark
will it show in the black detector?
will it come out
wavery, indelible, true
through the african giraffe in its edeny greenery,
the moroccan hippopotamus ?
they stare from a square, stiff frill
they are for export,
one a fool, the other a fool
a secret an extra amber
brandy finger
roosting and cooing you, you
behind two eyes in which nothing is reflected but monkeys

stab a few cloves in an apple,
make a sachet or
do away with the bastard
do away with it altogether
no, no, it is happy there
but it wants to get out
look, look it is wanting to crawl
my god, there goes the stopper
the cars in the place de la concorde
watch out

horns twirling and jungle gutturals
an exploded bottle of stout,
slack foam in the lap

you do not do, you do not do

for thirty years, poor and white,
barely daring to breathe or achoo
daddy, i have had to kill you
you died before i had time
s marbleheavy, a bag full of god,
ghastly statue with one gray toe
big as a frisco seal
and a head in the freakish atlantic
where it pours bean green over blue
in the waters off beautiful nauset
i used to pray to recover you
ach, du

scraped flat by the roller
of wars, wars, wars
but the name of the town is common
my polack friend

says there are a dozen or two
so i never could tell where you
put your foot, your root,
i never could talk to you
the tongue stuck in my jaw
it stuck in a barb wire snare
ich, ich, ich, ich,
i could hardly speak
i thought every german was you
and the language obscene
an engine, an engine
chuffing me off like a jew
a jew to dachau, auschwitz, belsen
i began to talk like a jew
i think i may well be a jew
the snows of the tyrol, the clear beer of vienna
are not very pure or true
with my gipsy ancestress and my weird luck
and my taroc pack and my taroc pack
i may be a bit of a jew
i have always been scared of you,
with your luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo
and your neat mustache
and your aryan eye, bright blue
panzerman, panzerman, o you
not god but a swastika
so black no sky could squeak through
every woman adores a fascist,
the boot in the face, the brute
brute heart of a brute like you
you stand at the blackboard, daddy,
in the picture i have of you,
a cleft in your chin instead of your foot
but no less a devil for that, no not
any less the black man who
ig
bit my pretty red heart in two
i was ten when they buried you
at twenty i tried to die
and get back, back, back to you
i thought even the bones would do
but they pulled me out of the sack,
and they stuck me together with glue
and then i knew what to do
i made a model of you,
a man in black with a meinkampf look
and a love of the rack and the screw
and i said i do, i do
so daddy, im finally through
the black telephones off at the root,
the voices just cant worm through
if ive killed one man, ive killed two
the vampire who said he was you
and drank my blood for a year,
seven years, if you want to know
daddy, you can lie back now
theres a stake in your fat black heart
and the villagers never liked you
they are dancing and stamping on you
they always knew it was you

red stigmata at the very center,

my mind winds to you
old barnacled umbilicus, atlantic cable,
keeping itself, it seems, in a state of miraculous repair
in any case, you are always there,
tremulous breath at the end of my line,
curve of water upleaping

touching and sucking
i didnt call you
i didnt call you at all
nevertheless, nevertheless
you steamed to me over the sea,
fat and red, a placenta
paralysing the kicking lovers
cobra light
squeezing the breath from the blood bells
of the fuchsia i could draw no breath,
dead and moneyless,
overexposed, like an xray
who do you think you are ?

seven hours knocked out of my right mind
into a black sack
where i relax, foetus or cat,
lever of his wet dreams

my sleeping capsule, my red and blue zeppelin
drops me from a terrible altitude
carapace smashed,
i spread to the beaks of birds
little gimlets
what holes this papery day is already full of
he has been burning me with cigarettes,
pretending i am a negress with pink paws
am myself that is not enough
the fever trickles and stiffens in my hair
my ribs show what have i eaten ?
lies and smiles
surely the sky is not that color,
surely the grass should be rippling

i dream of someone else entirely
and he, for this subversion,
hurts me, he
with his armor of fakery,
his high cold masks of amnesia
how did i get here ?
indeterminate criminal,
i die with variety
hung, starved, burned, hooked
i imagine him
impotent as distant thunder,
in whose shadow i have eaten my ghost ration
i wish him dead or away
that, it seems, is the impossibility
that being free what would the dark
do without fevers to eat ?
what would the light
do without eyes to knife, what would he
do, do, do without me ?

hothouse baby in its crib,

devilish leopard

sea of his eyes washing over it
and a round bubble
popping upward from the mouths of bells
people and cows
the lyonians had always thought
heaven would be something else,
but with the same faces,
the same places
it was not a shock
the dear, green, quite breathable atmosphere,
cold grits underfoot,
and the spidery waterdazzle on field and street
it never occurred that they had been forgot,
that the big god
had lazily closed one eye and let them slip
over the english cliff and under so much history
they did not see him smile,
turn, like an animal,
in his cage of ether, his cage of stars
hed had so many wars
the white gape of his mind was the real tabula rasa

this is winter, this is night, small love
a sort of black horsehair,
a rough, dumb country stuff
steeled with the sheen
of what green stars can make it to our gate
i hold you on my arm
it is very late
the dull bells tongue the hour
the mirror floats us at one candle power
this is the fluid in which we meet each other,
this haloey radiance that seems to breathe
and lets our shadows wither
only to blow
them huge again, violent giants on the wall
one match scratch makes you real
at first the candle will not bloom at all
it snuffs its bud
to almost nothing, to a dull blue dud
i hold my breath until you creak to life,
balled hedgehog,

small and cross the yellow knife
grows tall you clutch your bars
my singing makes you roar
i rock you like a boat
across the indian carpet, the cold floor,
while the brass man
kneels, back bent, as best he can
hefting his white pillar with the light
that keeps the sky at bay,
the sack of black it is everywhere, tight, tight
he is yours, the little brassy atlas
poor heirloom, all you have,
at his heels a pile of five brass cannonballs,
no child, no wife
five balls five bright brass balls
to juggle with, my love, when the sky falls

yes, yes, this is my address
not a patch on your place, i guess, with the javanese
geese and the monkey trees

a bit of a wild machine, a bit of a mess

thats my frost box, no cat,
though it looks like a cat, with its fluffy stuff, pure white

you should see the objects it makes
millions of needly glass cakes
fine for the migraine or the bellyache and this
is where i kept the furnace,
each coal a hot crossstitcha lovely light
it simply exploded one night,
it went up in smoke
and thats why i have no hair, auntie, thats why i choke
off and on, as if i just had to retch
coal gas is ghastly stuff
heres a spot i thought youd love
morning glory pool
the blues a jewel
it boils for forty hours at a stretch
i shouldnt dip my hankie in, it hurts
last summer, my god, last summer
it ate seven maids and a plumber
and returned them steamed and pressed and stiff as shirts
am bitter? im averse?
heres your specs, dear, heres your purse
toddle on home to tea now in your flat hat
itll be lemon tea for me,
lemon tea and earwig biscuitscreepycreepy
youd not want that
toddle on home, before the weathers worse
toddle on home, and dont trip on the nurse
she may be bald, she may have no eyes,
but auntie, shes awfully nice
shes pink, shes a born midwife
she can bring the dead to life
with her wiggly fingers and for a very small fee
well i hope youve enjoyed it, auntie

a hospital of dolls

pumped ahead by these pistons, this blood

dynasty of broken arrows

turning and turning in the middle air,
untouched and untouchable
the train is dragging itself, it is screaming
an animal
insane for the destination,

i shall count and bury the dead
let their souls writhe in a dew,

such coldness, forgetfulness

warm and human, then their pink light

their merciless churn

worms in the glottal stops

white towers of smithfield ahead,
fat haunches and blood on their minds
there is no mercy in the glitter of cleavers,
the butchers guillotine that whispers hows this, hows this?
in the bowl the hare is aborted,
its baby head out of the way, embalmed in spice,
flayed of fur and humanity
let us eat it like platos afterbirth,
let us eat it like christ
these are the people that were important
their round eyes, their teeth, their grimaces
on a stick that rattles and clicks, a counterfeit snake
shall the hood of the cobra appall me
the loneliness of its eye, the eye of the mountains
through which the sky eternally threads itself?
the world is bloodhot and personal
dawn says, with its bloodflush
there is no terminus, only suitcases
out of which the same self unfolds like a suit
bald and shiny, with pockets of wishes,

notions and tickets, short circuits and folding mirrors

no rings through the nose, no cries
bright fish hooks, the smiles of women
gulp at my bulk
and i, in my snazzy blacks,
mill a litter of breasts like jellyfish

mystic
the air is a mill of hooks
questions without answer,
glittering and drunk as flies
whose kiss stings unbearably
in the fetid wombs of black air under pines in summer
i remember
the dead smell of sun on wood cabins,
the stiffness of sails, the long salt winding sheets
once one has seen god, what is the remedy ?
once one has been seized up
without a part left over,
not a toe, not a finger, and used,
used utterly, in the suns conflagrations, the stains
that lengthen from ancient cathedrals
what is the remedy ?
the pill of the communion tablet,
the walking beside still water ? memory ?

or picking up the bright pieces
of christ in the faces of rodents,
the tame flowernibblers, the ones
whose hopes are so low they are comfortable
the humpback in his small, washed cottage
under the spokes of the clematis
is there no great love, only tenderness ?
does the sea
remember the walker upon it ?
meaning leaks from the molecules
the chimneys of the city breathe, the window sweats,
the children leap in their cots
the sun blooms, it is a geranium
the heart has not stopped

kindness glides about my house
dame kindness, she is so nice
the blue and red jewels of her rings smoke
in the windows, the mirrors
are filling with smiles
what is so real as the cry of a child ?
a rabbits cry may be wilder
but it has no soul
sugar can cure everything, so kindness says
sugar is a necessary fluid,
its crystals a little poultice
o kindness, kindness
sweetly picking up pieces
my japanese silks, desperate butterflies,
may be pinned any minute, anesthetized

and here you come, with a cup of tea
wreathed in steam
the blood jet is poetry,
there is no stopping it
you hand me two children, two roses

axes
after whose stroke the wood rings,
and the echoes
echoes traveling
off from the center like horses
the sap
wells like tears, like the
water striving
to reestablish its mirror
over the rock
that drops and turns,
a white skull,
eaten by weedy greens
years later i
encounter them on the road
words dry and riderless,
the indefatigable hooftaps
while
from the bottom of the pool, fixed stars
govern a life

contusion
color floods to the spot, dull purple
the rest of the body is all washed out,
the color of pearl
in a pit of rock
the sea sucks obsessively,
one hollow the whole seas pivot
the size of a fly,
the doom mark
crawls down the wall
the heart shuts,
the sea slides back,
the mirrors are sheeted

balloons
since christmas they have lived with us,
guileless and clear,
oval soulanimals,
taking up half the space,
moving and rubbing on the silk
invisible air drifts,
giving a shriek and pop
when attacked, then scooting to rest, barely trembling
yellow cathead, blue fish
such queer moons we live with
instead of dead furniture
straw mats, white walls
and these traveling
globes of thin air, red, green,
delighting
the heart like wishes or free
peacocks blessing
old ground with a feather
beaten in starry metals
your small
brother is making
his balloon squeak like a cat
seeming to see
a funny pink world he might eat on the other side of it,
he bites,
then sits
back, fat jug
contemplating a world clear as water
a red
shred in his little fist

edge
the woman is perfected
her dead
body wears the smile of accomplishment,
the illusion of a greek necessity
flows in the scrolls of her toga,
her bare
feet seem to be saying
we have come so far, it is over
each dead child coiled, a white serpent,
one at each little
pitcher of milk, now empty
she has folded
i
them back into her body as petals
of a rose close when the garden
stiffens and odors bleed
from the sweet, deep throats of the night flower
the moon has nothing to be sad about,
staring from her hood of bone
she is used to this sort of thing
her blacks crackle and drag

disquieting muses all through the poem i have in mind the enigmatic figures in this
paintingthree terrible faceless dressmakers dummies in classical gowns, seated and
standing in a weird, clear light that casts the long strong shadows characteristic of de
chiricos early work the dummies suggest a twentiethcentury version of other
sinister trios of womenthe three fates, the witches in macbeth, de quinceys sisters

streets, all made within the last fifty years or so, ugly crude black stones, headstones
together, as if the dead were sleeping head to head in a poorhouse in the third yard, on
a flat grassy area looking across a sallow barren stretch to rows of wooden tenements i
found the flat stone otto e plath  right beside the path, where it would
be walked over felt cheated my temptation to dig him up to prove he existed and
really was dead how far gone would he be ? no trees, no peace, his headstone jammed
up against the body on the other side left shortly it is good to have the place in mind

q u e e n marys rose garden
in this day before the day nobody is about
a sea of dreams washes the edge of my green island
in the center of the garden named after queen mary
the great roses, many of them scentless,
rule their beds like beheaded and resurrected and all silent royalty,
the only fare on my bare breakfast plate
such a waste of brightness i cant understand
it is six in the morning and finer than any sunday
yet there is no walker and looker but myself
the sky of the city is white the light from the country
some ducks step down off their greenreeded shelf
and into the silver element of the pond
i see them start to cruise and dip for food
under the belljar of a wonderland
hedged in and evidently inviolate
though hundreds of londoners know it like the palm of their hand
the roses are named after queens and people of note
or after gay days, or colors the grower found good
and i have no intention of disparaging them
for being too wellbred and smelless and liking the city
i enjoy petticoats and velvets and gossip of court,
and a titled lady may frequently be a beauty
a devon meadow might offer a simpler sort
of personagesingleskirted, perfumed, a gem
but i am content with this more pompous lot

the rival this poem originally had two further sections, as follows

compared to you, i am corruptible as a loaf of bread
while i sleep, the black spores nod
their magnified heads and plan to kill me as soon as possible
the wrinkles creep up like waves,
one camouflaging itself behind another
i should have a steel complexion like yours
in which the minutes could admire their reflections and forget about me

i try to think of a place to hide you
as a desk drawer hides a poison pen letter,
but there is no drawer to hold you
blue sky or black
you preoccupy my horizon
what good is all that space if it cant draw you off?
you are the one eye out there
the sea, also, is ineffectual
it keeps washing you up like an old bone
and i, on the skymirroring, bland sands
find you over and over, lipped like a skate and smiling,
with the sound of the sea in your mouth
angel of coldness,
surely it is not i you want so badly
i thought earth might use you
she has a terrible way with minerals,
but even her tonnage doesnt impress a diamond
your facets are indestructible
their lights whiten my heart
toadstone i see i must wear you in the centre of my forehead
and let the dead sleep as they deserve

speaking about this poem in a bbc radio broadcast, she said i do not like to think
of all the things, familiar, useful and worthy things, i have never put into a poem i did,
once, put a yew tree in and that yew tree began, with astounding egotism, to manage
and order the whole affair it was not a yew tree by a church on a road past a house in a
town where a certain woman lived    and so on, as it might have been in a novel oh
no it stood squarely in the middle of my poem, manipulating its dark shades, the
voices in the churchyard, the clouds, the birds, the tender melancholy with which i
contemplated iteverything i couldnt subdue it and, in the end, my poem was a
poem about a yew tree the yew tree was just too proud to be a passing black mark in a
novel

what honey summons these animalcules ?
what fear? it has set them zinging
on envious strings, and you are the center
they are assailing your brain like numerals,
they contort your hair
beneath the flat handkerchief you wear instead of a hat
they are making a cats cradle, they are suicidal
their deathpegs stud your gloves, it is no use running
the black veil molds to your lips
they are fools
after, they stagger and weave, under no banner
after, they crawl
dispatched, into trenches of grass
ossifying like junked statues
gelded and wingless not heroes not heroes




the swarm when bees swarm, they sometimes cluster in a ball high in a tree, while
they make up their minds where to go any loud sudden noise, such as gunfire, can
make them come down to a much lower level where the beekeeper can reach them, and
collect them into a box or skip he then shakes the whole lot out on to a broad surface
that slopes up into a fresh empty hive the bees obediently march up into the hive, as
described towards the end of this poem

substance of this poem after several pages of what looks like feverish exploration of

this poem is about the double or schizophrenic nature of deaththe marmoreal
coldness of blakes death mask, say, hand in glove with the fearful softness of worms,
water and other katabolists i imagine these two aspects of death as two men, two

the only translations by sylvia plath that survive are four sonnets of ronsard and one poem
by rilke, made in the course of studying french and german literature following is her
literal rendering of rilkes a prophet, made about
dilated by immense visions
bright with the firelight from the outcome
of judgments, which never destroy him,
are his eyes, gazing out from under thick
brows and in his inmost soul
already words are raising themselves again
not his words for what would his be
and how indulgently would they be lavished ?
but others, severe pieces of iron, stones,
which he must dissolve like a volcano
in order to cast them forth in the outburst
from his mouth, which curses and damns
while his forehead, like the face of a hound
seeks to transmit that
which the master chooses within his mind
this one, this one, whom they all might find
if they followed the great pointing hand
which reveals him as he is enraged

the fifty poems printed here are a selection from sylvia plaths work produced

have followed his textual suggestions
bitter strawberries
all that morning in the strawberry field
they talked about the russians
squatted down between the rows
we listened
we heard the head woman say,
bomb them off the map
horseflies buzzed, paused and stung
and the taste of strawberries
turned thick and sour
mary said slowly, ive got a fella
old enough to go
if anything should happen
the sky was high and blue
two children laughed at tag
in the tall grass,
leaping awkward and longlegged
across the rutted road
the fields were full of bronzed young men
hoeing lettuce, weeding celery
the draft is passed, the woman said
we ought to have bombed them long ago
dont, pleaded the little girl
with blond braids
juvenilia
her blue eyes swam with vague terror
she added pettishly, i cant see why
youre always talking this way
oh, stop worrying, nelda,
snapped the woman sharply
she stood up, a thin commanding figure
in faded dungarees
businesslike she asked us, how many quarts?
she recorded the total in her notebook,
and we all turned back to picking
kneeling over the rows,
we reached among the leaves
with quick practiced hands,
cupping the berry protectively before
snapping off the stem
between thumb and forefinger
family reunion
outside in the street i hear
a car door slam voices coming near
incoherent scraps of talk
and high heels clicking up the walk
the doorbell rends the noonday heat
with copper claws
a seconds pause
the dull drums of my pulses beat
against a silence wearing thin
the door now opens from within
oh, hear the clash of people meeting
the laughter and the screams of greeting
fat always, and out of breath,
a greasy smack on every cheek
from aunt elizabeth
there, thats the pink, pleased squeak
of cousin jane, our spinster with
the faded eyes
and hands like nervous butterflies
while rough as splintered wood
across them all
rasps the jarring baritone of uncle paul
juvenilia
the youngest nephew gives a fretful whine
and drools at the reception line
like a diver on a lofty spar of land
atop the flight of stairs i stand
a whirlpool leers at me,
absorbent as a sponge
i cast off my identity
and make the fatal plunge
female author
all day she plays at chess with the bones of the world
favored while suddenly the rains begin
beyond the window she lies on cushions curled
and nibbles an occasional bonbon of sin
prim, pinkbreasted, feminine, she nurses
chocolate fancies in rosepapered rooms
where polished highboys whisper creaking curses
and hothouse roses shed immoral blooms
the garnets on her fingers twinkle quick
and blood reflects across the manuscript
she muses on the odor, sweet and sick,
of festering gardenias in a crypt,
and lost in subtle metaphor, retreats
from gray child faces crying in the streets
april

rots in the hollow of my skull
and if my stomach would contract

such as pregnancy or constipation
i would not remember you
juvenilia
or that because of sleep
infrequent as a moon of greencheese
that because of food
nourishing as violet leaves
that because of these
and in a few fatal yards of grass
in a few spaces of sky and treetops

as easily and irretrievably
as a tennis ball at twilight
gold mouths cry
gold mouths cry with the green young
certainty of the bronze boy
remembering a thousand autumns
and how a hundred thousand leaves
came sliding down his shoulderblades
persuaded by his bronze heroic reason
we ignore the coming doom of gold
and we are glad in this bright metal season
even the dead laugh among the goldenrod
the bronze boy stands kneedeep in centuries,
and never grieves,
remembering a thousand autumns,
with sunlight of a thousand years upon his lips
and his eyes gone blind with leaves
dirge for a joker
always in the middle of a kiss
came the profane stimulus to cough
always from the pulpit during service
leaned the devil prompting you to laugh
behind mockceremony of your grief
lurked the burlesque instinct of the ham
you never altered your amused belief
that life was a mere monumental sham
juvenilia
from the comic accident of birth
to the final grotesque joke of death
your malady of sacrilegious mirth
spread gay contagion with each clever breath
now you must play the straight man for a term
and tolerate the humor of the worm
to eva descending the stair
a villanelle
clocks cry stillness is a lie, my dear
the wheels revolve, the universe keeps running
proud you halt upon the spiral stair
the asteroids turn traitor in the air,
and planets plot with old elliptic cunning
clocks cry stillness is a lie, my dear
red the unraveled rose sings in your hair
blood springs eternal if the heart be burning
proud you halt upon the spiral stair
cryptic stars wind up the atmosphere,
in solar schemes the tilted suns go turning
clocks cry stillness is a lie, my dear
loud the immortal nightingales declare
love flames forever if the flesh be yearning
proud you halt upon the spiral stair
circling zodiac compels the year
intolerant beauty never will be learning
clocks cry stillness is a lie, my dear
proud you halt upon the spiral stair

juvenilia
the whole revolving tall glass palace hall
where guests slide gliding into light like wine
rose candles flicker on the lilac wall
reflecting in a million flagons shine,
and gilded couples all in whirling trance
follow holiday revel begun long since,
until near twelve the strange girl all at once
guiltstricken halts, pales, clings to the prince
as amid the hectic music and cocktail talk
she hears the caustic ticking of the clock
jilted
my thoughts are crabbed and sallow,
my tears like vinegar,
or the bitter blinking yellow
of an acetic star
tonight the caustic wind, love,
gossips late and soon,
and i wear the wryfaced pucker of
the sour lemon moon
while like an early summer plum,
puny, green, and tart,
droops upon its wizened stem
my lean, unripened heart
sonnet to eva
all right, lets say you could take a skull and break it
the way youd crack a clock youd crush the bone
between steel palms of inclination, take it,
observing the wreck of metal and rare stone
this was a woman her loves and stratagems
betrayed in mute geometry of broken
cogs and disks, inane mechanic whims,
and idle coils of jargon yet unspoken
juvenilia

the scraps of rusted reverie, the wheels
of notched tin platitudes concerning weather,
perfume, politics, and fixed ideals
the idiot bird leaps up and drunken leans
to chirp the hour in lunatic thirteens
bluebeard

metamorphoses of the moon
cold moons withdraw, refusing to come to terms
with the pilot who dares all heavens harms
to raid the zone where fate begins,
flings silver gauntlet of his plane at space,
demanding satisfaction no duel takes place
the mute air merely thins and thins
sky wont be drawn closer absolute,
it holds aloof, a shrouded parachute
always the same distance from
the falling man who never will abstain
from asking, but inventive, hopes in vain
challenges the silent dome
no violation but gives dividends
of slow disaster the bitten apple ends
the eden of bucolic eve
understanding breaks through the skulls shell
and like a cuckoo in the nest makes hell
for naive larks who starve and grieve
what prince has ever seized the shining grail
but that it turned into a milking pail ?
its likely that each secret sought
will prove to be some common parlor fake
a craft with paint and powder that can make
cleopatra from a slut
for most exquisite truths are artifice
framed in disciplines of fire and ice
which conceal incongruous
elements like dirty socks and scraps
of dayold bread and eggstained plates perhaps
such sophistry can placate us
juvenilia
but yet the perverse imp within will probe
beneath the fringes of forbidden robe,
seduced by curiosity,
until in disenchantment our eyes glut
themselves on the clay toes and short clubfoot
which mar the idols sanctity
the choice between the mica mystery
of moonlight or the pockmarked face we see
through the scrupulous telescope
is always to be made innocence
is a fairytale intelligence
hangs itself on its own rope
either way we choose, the angry witch
will punish us for saying which is which
in fatal equilibrium
we poise on perilous poles that freeze us in
a cross of contradiction, racked between
the fact of doubt, the faith of dream
dialogue en route

shot past the ninetyfourth floor
to corral the conundrum of space
at its cryptic celestial origin
they both watched the barometer sink
as the world swiveled round in its orbit
and thousands were born and dropped dead,
when, from the inane overhead
too quick for the pair to absorb it,
came a gargantuan galactic wink
to a jilted lover
cold on my narrow cot i lie
and in sorrow look
through my windowsquare of black
figured in the midnight sky,
a mosaic of stars
diagrams the falling years,
while from the moon, my lovers eye
chills me to death

now there is nowhere i can go
to hide from him
moon and sun reflect his flame
in the morning all shall be
the same again
stars pale before the angry dawn
the gilded cock will turn for me
the rack of time
until the peak of noon has come
and by that glare, my love will see
how i am still
blazing in my golden hell
the dream
last night, he said, i slept well
except for two uncanny dreams
that came before the change of weather
when i rose and opened all
the shutters to let warm wind feather
with wet plumage through my rooms
in the first dream i was driving
down the dark in a black hearse
with many men until i crashed
a light, and right away a raving
woman followed us and rushed
to halt our car in headlong course
juvenilia
crying, she came to the island
where we stopped, and with a curse
demanded that i pay a fine
for being such a rude assailant
and damaging the whole unseen
lighting plant of the universe
behind me then i heard a voice
warning me to hold her hand
and kiss her on the mouth for she
loved me and a brave embrace
would avoid all penalty
i know, i know, i told my friend
but yet i waited to be fined
and took the womans bright subpoena
while she washed the way with tears,
then drove to you upon the wind
i do not tell you the nightmare
which occurred to me in china
sonnet to time
today we move in jade and cease with garnet
amid the ticking jeweled clocks that mark
our years death comes in a casual steel car, yet
we vaunt our days in neon and scorn the dark
but outside the diabolic steel of this
most plasticwindowed city, i can hear
the lone wind raving in the gutter, his
voice crying exclusion in my ear
so cry for the pagan girl left picking olives
beside a sunblue sea, and mourn the flagon
raised to toast a thousand kings, for all gives
sorrow weep for the legendary dragon
time is a great machine of iron bars
that drains eternally the milk of stars
juvenilia
the trial of man
the ordinary milkman brought that dawn
of destiny, delivered to the door
in square hermetic bottles, while the sun
ruled decree of doomsday on the floor
the morning paper clocked the headline hour
you drank your coffee like original sin,
and at the jetplane anger of gods roar
got up to let the suave blue policeman in
impaled upon a stern angelic stare
you were condemned to serve the legal limit
and burn to death within your neon hell
now, disciplined in the strict ancestral chair,
you sit, solemneyed, about to vomit,
the future an electrode in your skull
april aubade
worship this world of watercolor mood
in glass pagodas hung with veils of green
where diamonds jangle hymns within the blood
and sap ascends the steeple of the vein
a saintly sparrow jargons madrigals
to waken dreamers in the milky dawn,
while tulips bow like a college of cardinals
before that papal paragon, the sun
christened in a spindrift of snowdrop stars,
where on pinkfluted feet the pigeons pass
and jonquils sprout like solomons metaphors,
my love and i go garlanded with grass
again we are deluded and infer
that somehow we are younger than we were
juvenilia
go get the goodly squab
go get the goodly squab in goldlobed corn
and pluck the drollflecked quail where thick they lie
reap the round blue pigeon from roof ridge,
but let the fastfeathered eagle fly
let the fastfeathered eagle fly
and the skies crack through with thunder
hide, hide, in the deep nest
lest the lightning strike you to cinder
go snare the sleeping bear in leaflined den
and trap the muskrat napping in slack sun
dupe the dull sow lounging snout in mud,
but let the galloping antelope run
let the galloping antelope run
and the snow blow up behind
hide, hide, in the safe cave
lest the blizzard drive you blind
go cull the purple snails from slothful shells
and bait the drowsing trout by the brooks brim
gather idle oysters from green shoals,
but let the quicksilver mackerel swim
let the quicksilver mackerel swim
where the black wave topples down
hide, hide, in the warm port
lest the water drag you to drown
trio of love songs
o
major faults in granite
mark a mortal lack,
yet individual planet
directs all zodiac
diagram of mountains
graphs a fever chart,
juvenilia
yet astronomic fountains
exit from the heart
tempo of strict ocean
metronomes the blood,
yet ordered lunar motion
proceeds from private flood
drama of each season
plots doom from above,
yet all angelic reason
moves to our minor love

my love for you is more
athletic than a verb,
agile as a star
the tents of sun absorb
treading circus tightropes
of each syllable,
the brazen jackanapes
would fracture if he fell
acrobat of space,
the daring adjective
plunges for a phrase
describing arcs of love
nimble as a noun,
he catapults in air
a planetary swoon
could climax his career,
but adroit conjunction
eloquently shall
link to his lyric action
a periodic goal
juvenilia

if you dissect a bird
to diagram the tongue,
youll cut the chord
articulating song
if you flay a beast
to marvel at the mane,
youll wreck the rest
from which the fur began
if you assault a fish
to analyse the fin,
your hands will crush
the generating bone
if you pluck out my heart
to find what makes it move,
youll halt the clock
that syncopates our love
lament
a villanelle
the sting of bees took away my father
who walked in a swarming shroud of wings
and scorned the tick of the falling weather
lightning licked in a yellow lather
but missed the mark with snaking fangs
the sting of bees took away my father
trouncing the sea like a raging bather,
he rode the flood in a pride of prongs
and scorned the tick of the falling weather
a scowl of sun struck down my mother,
tolling her grave with golden gongs,
but the sting of bees took away my father
he counted the guns of god a bother,
laughed at the ambush of angels tongues,
and scorned the tick of the falling weather
juvenilia
o ransack the four winds and find another
man who can mangle the grin of kings
the sting of bees took away my father
who scorned the tick of the falling weather
doomsday
the idiot bird leaps out and drunken leans
atop the broken universal clock
the hour is crowed in lunatic thirteens
our painted stages fall apart by scenes
while all the actors halt in mortal shock
the idiot bird leaps out and drunken leans
streets crack through in havocsplit ravines
as the doomstruck city crumbles block by block
the hour is crowed in lunatic thirteens
fractured glass flies down in smithereens
our lucky relics have been put in hock
the idiot bird leaps out and drunken leans
gods monkey wrench has blasted all machines
we never thought to hear the holy cock
the hour is crowed in lunatic thirteens
too late to ask if end was worth the means,
too late to calculate the toppling stock
the idiot bird leaps out and drunken leans,
the hour is crowed in lunatic thirteens
moonsong at morning
o moon of illusion,
enchanting men
with tinsel vision
along the vein,
cocks crow up a rival
to mock your face
juvenilia
and eclipse that oval
which conjured us
to leave our reason
and come to this
fabled horizon
of caprice
dawn shall dissever
your silver veil
which let lover think lover
beautiful
the light of logic
will show us that
all moonstruck magic
is dissolute
no sweet disguises
withstand that stare
whose candor exposes
loves paling sphere
in gardens of squalor
the sleepers wake
as their golden jailer
turns the rack
each sacred body
night yielded up
is mangled by study
of microscope
facts have blasted
the angels frame
and stern truth twisted
the radiant limb
reflect in terror
the scorching sun
dive at your mirror
and drown within

doom of exiles
now we, returning from the vaulted domes
of our colossal sleep, come home to find
a tall metropolis of catacombs
erected down the gangways of our mind
green alleys where we reveled have become
the infernal haunt of demon dangers
both seraph song and violins are dumb
each clock tick consecrates the death of strangers
backward we traveled to reclaim the day
before we fell, like icarus, undone
all we find are altars in decay
and profane words scrawled black across the sun
still, stubbornly we try to crack the nut
in which the riddle of our race is shut

oh never try to knock on rotten wood
or play another card game when youve won
never try to know more than you should
the magic golden apples all look good
although the wicked witch has poisoned one
oh never try to knock on rotten woi
from here the moon seems smooth as angelfood,
from here you cant see spots upon the sun
never try to know more than you should
the suave dissembling cobra wears a hood
and swaggers like a proper gentleman
oh never try to knock on rotten wood
while angels wear a wakeful attitude
disguise beguiles and mortal mischiefs done
never try to know more than you should
for deadly secrets strike when understood
and lucky stars all exit on the run
never try to knock on rotten wood,
never try to know more than you should
never try to trick me with a kiss
never try to trick me with a kiss
pretending that the birds are here to stay
the dying man will scoff in scorn at this
a stone can masquerade where no heart is
and virgins rise where lustful venus lay
never try to trick me with a kiss
juvenilia
our noble doctor claims the pain is his,
while stricken patients let him have his say
the dying man will scoff in scorn at this
each virile bachelor dreads paralysis,
the old maid in the gable cries all day
never try to trick me with a kiss
the suave eternal serpents promise bliss
to mortal children longing to be gay
the dying man will scoff in scorn at this
sooner or later something goes amiss
the singing birds pack up and fly away
so never try to trick me with a kiss
the dying man will scoff in scorn at this
the dead
revolving in oval loops of solar speed,
couched in cauls of clay as in holy robes,
dead men render love and war no heed,
lulled in the ample womb of the fulltilt globe
no spiritual caesars are these dead
they want no proud paternal kingdom come
and when at last they blunder into bed
worldwrecked, they seek only oblivion
rolled round with goodly loam and cradled deep,
these bone shanks will not wake immaculate
to trumpettoppling dawn of doomstruck day
they loll forever in colossal sleep
nor can gods stern, shocked angels cry them up
from their fond, final, infamous decay
danse macabre
down among strict roots and rocks,
eclipsed beneath blind lid of land
goes the grassembroidered box
juvenilia
arranged in sheets of ice, the fond
skeleton still craves to have
fever from the world behind
hands reach back to relics of
nippled moons, extinct and cold,
frozen in designs of love
at twelve, each skull is aureoled
with recollections ticking thorns
winding up the raveled mold
needles nag like unicorns,
assault a sleeping virgins shroud
till her stubborn body burns
lured by brigands in the blood,
shanks of bone now resurrect,
inveigled to forsake the sod
eloping from their slabs, abstract
couples court by milk of moon
sheer silver blurs their phantom act
luminous, the town of stone
anticipates the warning sound
of cockcrow crying up the dawn
with kiss of cinders, ghosts descend,
compelled to deadlock underground
circus in three rings
in the circus tent of a hurricane
designed by a drunken god
my extravagant heart blows up again
in a rampage of champagnecolored rain
and the fragments whir like a weather vane
while the angels all applaud
daring as death and debonair
i invade my lions den
a rose of jeopardy flames in my hair
juvenilia
yet i flourish my whip with a fatal flair
defending my perilous wounds with a chair
while the gnawings of love begin
mocking as mephistopheles,
eclipsed by magicians disguise,
my demon of doom tilts on a trapeze,
winged rabbits revolving about his knees,
only to vanish with devilish ease
in a smoke that sears my eyes
prologue to spring
the winter landscape hangs in balance now,
transfixed by glare of blue from gorgons eye
the skaters freeze within a stone tableau
air alters into glass and the whole sky
grows brittle as a tilted china bowl
hill and valley stiffen row on row
each fallen leaf is trapped by spell of steel,
crimped like fern in the quartz atmosphere
repose of sculpture holds the country still
what countermagic can undo the snare
which has stopped the season in its tracks
and suspended all that might occur?
locked in crystal caskets are the lakes,
yet as we wonder what can come of ice
greensinging birds explode from all the rocks
song for a revolutionary love
o throw it away, throw it all away on the wind
first let the heavenly foliage go,
and page by pride the good books blow
scatter smug angels with your hand
juvenilia
undo the doings of the fathering age
chuck the broken acropolis out,
fling the seven wonders after that
with struts and props of the holy stage
disrupt the calendars next send the duteous
packing without a compass or scale
to chart the measure of fortunes wheel
let nothing be left to swaddle us
unravel antique samplers, unwind the clocks,
till unruly children stream down the sky
and old maids on impromptu petticoats fly
with begonia and building blocks
now empty boxes of the hoodwinked dead
upon the pouring air until
god hears from his great sunstruck hell
the chittering crackpots that he made
then hurl the bare world like a bluegreen ball
back into the holocaust
to burn away the humbug rust
and again together begin it all
sonnet to satan
in darkroom of your eye the mojnly mind
somersaults to counterfeit eclipse
bright angels black out over logics land
under shutter of their handicaps
commanding that corkscrew comet jet forth ink
to pitch the white world down in swiveling flood,
you overcast all orders noonday rank
and turn gods radiant photograph to shade
steepling snake in that contrary light
invades the dilate lens of genesis
to print your flaming image in birthspot
with characters no cockcrow can deface
o maker of proud planets negative,
obscure the scalding sun till no clocks move

a sorcerer bids farewell to seem
im through with this grand lookingglass hotel
where adjectives play croquet with flamingo nouns
methinks i shall absent me for a while
from rhetoric of these rococo queens

and auction off each rare whiterabbit verb
send my muse alice packing with gaudy scraps
of mushroom simile and gryphon garb
my native sleightofhand is wearing out
mad hatters hat yields no new metaphor,

its time to vanish like the cheshire cat

then syncopate a sky of dufyblue
with tilted spars of sloops revolved by white
gulls in a feathered fugue of wings outdo
seurat fleck schooner flanks with sun and set
a tremolo of turquoise quivering in
the tessellated wave now nimbly let
a tinsel pizzicato on fish fin
be plucked from caves of dappled amber where
a mermaid odalisque lolls at her ease
with orange scallops tangled in wet hair,
fresh from the mellow palette of matisse
suspend this day, so singularly designed,
like a rare calder mobile in your mind

the fond admirers
burning darts
turn back to injure
the thrusting hand
and inflame to danger
the scarlet wound

for what fire could damage

so i stared in that furnace
where beauties char

insolent storm strikes at the skull
insolent storm strikes at the skull,
assaults the sleeping citadel,
knocking the warden to his knees
in impotence, to sue for peace,
while wantonly amused by this,
wind wakes the whole metropolis
skeptic cyclones try the bone
of strict and sacred skeleton
polemic gales prove point by point
juvenilia
how flesh cleaves fast to frozen joint,
and a hurricane headache rocks
the temples of the orthodox
abracadabra of the rain
drowns noahs prayers with distain,
drives priest and prostitute in doorways,
bereft of moses and of mores
no ancient blueprint builds an ark
to navigate this final dark
river floods transcend the level
demarcating good from evil,
and casuist arguments run riot
inundating edens quiet
all absolutes that angels give
flounder in the relative
lightning conjures gods globe off its
orbit neither law nor prophets
can rectify truant intent
to doublecross the firmament
now earth rejects communication
with heavens autocratic station,
and violates celestial custom
by seceding from the solar system
scintillant irony inspires
independent rebel fires
till the announcers voice is lost
in heresies of holocaust
denouement
the telegram says you have gone away
and left our bankrupt circus on its own
there is nothing more for me to say

they shoot the dice for one remaining bone
there is nothing more for me to say

and jumbo sadly trumpets into stone

the magic sawdust writes address unknown
the telegram says you have gone away
there is nothing more for me to say
two lovers and a beachcomber by the real sea
cold and final, the imagination
shuts down its fabled summer house
blue views are boarded up our sweet vacation
dwindles in the hourglass
thoughts that found a maze of mermaid hair
tangling in the tides green fall
now fold their wings like bats and disappear
into the attic of the skull
we are not what we might be what we are
outlaws all extrapolation
beyond the interval of now and here
white whales are gone with the white ocean
a lone beachcomber squats among the wrack
of kaleidoscopic shells
probing fractured venus with a stick
under a tent of taunting gulls
no seachange decks the sunken shank of bone
that chuckles in backtrack of the wave
though the mind like an oyster labors on and on,
a grain of sand is all we have
water will run by rule the actual sun
will scrupulously rise and set
no little man lives in the exacting moon
and that is that, is that, is that

black pine tree in an orange light
tell me what you see in it
the pine tree like a rorschachblot
black against the orange light
plant an orange pumpkin patch
which at twelve will quaintly hatch
nine black mice with ebon coach,

a devils cataract of black
obscure gods eye with corkscrew fleck
put orange mistress half in sun,
half in shade, until her skin
tattoos black leaves on tangerine
read black magic or holy book
or lyric of love in the orange and black
till dark is conquered by orange cock,
but more pragmatic than all of this,
say how crafty the painter was
to make orange and black ambiguous
terminal
riding home from credulous blue domes,
the dreamer reins his waking appetite
in panic at the crop of catacombs
sprung up like plague of toadstools overnight
refectories where he reveled have become
the hostelry of worms, rapacious blades
who weave within the skeletons white womb
a caviare decay of rich brocades
turning the tables of this grave gourmet,
the fiendish butler saunters in and serves
for feast the sweetest meat of hells chef doeuvres
his own pale bride upon a flaming tray
parsleyed with elegies, she lies in state
waiting for his grace to consecrate
juvenilia
love is a parallax
perspective betrays with its dichotomy
train tracks always meet, not here, but only
in the impossible minds eye
horizons beat a retreat as we embark
on sophist seas to overtake that mark
where wave pretends to drench real sky
well then, if we agree, it is not odd
that one mans devil is anothers god
or that the solar spectrum is
a multitude of shaded grays suspense
on the quicksands of ambivalence
is our lifes whole nemesis
so we could rave on, darling, you and i,
until the stars tick out a lullaby
about each cosmic pro and con
nothing changes, for all the blazing of
our drastic jargon, but clock hands that move
implacably from twelve to one
we raise our arguments like sitting ducks
to knock them down with logic or with luck
and contradict ourselves for fun
the waitress holds our coats and we put on
the raw wind like a scarf love is a faun
who insists his playmates run
now you, my intellectual leprechaun,
would have me swallow the entire sun
like an enormous oyster, down
the ocean in one gulp you say a mark
of comet harakiri through the dark
should inflame the sleeping town
so kiss the drunks upon the curb and dames
in dubious doorways forget their monday names,
caper with candles in their heads
the leaves applaud, and santa claus flies in
scattering candy from a zeppelin,
playing his prodigal charades
juvenilia
the moon leans down to look the tilting fish
in the rare river wink and laugh we lavish
blessings right and left and cry
hello, and then hello again in deaf
churchyard ears until the starlit stiff
graves all carol in reply
now kiss again till our strict father leans
to call for curtain on our thousand scenes
brazen actors mock at him,
multiply pink harlequins and sing
in gay ventriloquy from wing to wing
while footlights flare and houselights dim
tell now, we taunt, where black or white begins
and separate the flutes from violins
the algebra of absolutes
explodes in a kaleidoscope of shapes
that jar, while each polemic jackanapes
joins his enemies recruits
the paradox is that the plays the thing
though prima donna pouts and critic stings,
there burns throughout the line of words,
the cultivated act, a fierce brief fusion
which dreamers call real, and realists, illusion
an insight like the flight of birds
arrows that lacerate the sky, while knowing
the secret of their ecstasys in going
some day, moving, one will drop,
and, dropping, die, to trace a wound that heals
only to reopen as flesh congeals
cycling phoenix never stops
so we shall walk barefoot on walnut shells
of withered worlds, and stamp out puny hells
and heavens till the spirits squeak
surrender to build our bed as high as jacks
bold beanstalk lie and love till sharp scythe hacks
away our rationed days and weeks
then let the blue tent topple, stars rain down,
and god or void appall us till we drown
in our own tears today we start

knows not of death nor calculus above
the simple sum of heart plus heart
aerialist
each night, this adroit young lady
lies among sheets
shredded fine as snowflakes
until dream takes her body
from bed to strict tryouts
in tightrope acrobatics
nightly she balances
catclever on perilous wire
in a gigantic hall,
footing her delicate dances
t o whipcrack and roar
which speak her maestros will
gilded, coming correct
across that sultry air,
she steps, halts, hung
in dead center of her act
as great weights drop all about her
and commence to swing
lessoned thus, the girl
parries the lunge and menace
of every pendulum
by deft duck and twirl
she draws applause bright harness
bites keen into each brave limb
then, this tough stint done, she curtsies
and serenely plummets down
to traverse glass floor
and get safe home but, turning with trained eyes,
tigertamer and grinning clown
squat, bowling black balls at her
tall trucks roll in
with a thunder like lions all aims
and lumbering moves
juvenilia
to trap this outrageous nimble queen
and shatter to atoms
her nine so slippery lives
sighting the stratagem
of black weight, black ball, black truck,
with a last artful dodge she leaps
through hoop of that hazardous dream
to sit up stark awake
as the loud alarmclock stops
now as penalty for her skill,
by day she must walk in dread
steel gauntlets of traffic, terrorstruck
lest, out of spite, the whole
elaborate scaffold of sky overhead
fall racketing finale on her luck
morning in the hospital solarium
sunlight strikes a glass of grapefruit juice,
flaring green through philodendron leaves
in this surrealistic house
of pink and beige, impeccable bamboo,
patronized by convalescent wives
heat shadows waver noiseless in
bright windowsquares until the women seem
to float like dreamfish in the languid limbo
of an undulant aquarium
morning another day, and talk
taxis indolent on whispered wheels
the starched white coat, the cats paw walk,
herald distraction a flock of pastel pills,
turquoise, rose, sierra mauve needles
that sting no more than love a room where time
ticks tempo to the casual climb
of mercury in graded tubes, where ills
slowly concede to sun and serum
like petulant parakeets corked up in cages
of intricate spunglass routine,
the women wait, fluttering, turning pages
of magazines in elegant ennui,

hoping for some incredible dark man
to assault the scene and make some
gaudy miracle occur, to come
and like a burglar steal their fancy
at noon, anemic husbands visit them
the princess and the goblins
o
from fabrication springs the spiral stair
up which the wakeful princess climbs to find
the source of blanching light that conjured her
to leave her bed of fever and ascend
a visionary ladder toward the moon
whose holy blue anoints her injured hand
with finger bandaged where the waspish pin
flew from the intricate embroidery
and stung according to the witchs plan,
she mounts through malice of the needles eye,
trailing her scrupulously simple gown
along bright asterisks by milky way
colonnades of angels nod her in
where ancient, infinite, and beautiful,
her legendary godmother leans down,
spinning a single stubborn thread of wool
which all the artful wizards cannot crimp
to keep the young girl from her crowning goal
initiated by the lunar lamp,
kindling her within a steepled flame,
the princess hears the thunder and the pomp
of squadrons underground abducting him
who is the destination of the cord
now bound around her wrist till she redeem
this miners boy from goblin bodyguard
juvenilia

guided only by the tug and twitch
of that mercurial strand, the girl goes down
the darkening stair, undoes the palace latch
and slips unseen past watchmen on the lawn
dozing around their silvered sentry box
across the frosted grass she marks the sheen
of thread conducting her to the worn tracks
made by miners up the mountainside
among the jagged mazes of the rocks
laboring on the tilt of that steep grade
behind which the declining moon has set,
she recalls queer stories her nurse read
about a goblin raid on miners hut
because new excavations came too near
the chambers where their fiendish queen would sit
hearing a weird cackle from afar,
she clutches at the talismanic cord
and confronts a cairn of iron ore
suddenly a brazen song is heard
from the pragmatic boy confined within,
gaily cursing the whole goblin horde
inviolate in the circle of that skein,
looping like faith about her bleeding feet,
the princess frees the miner, stone by stone,
and leads him home to be her chosen knight

the princess coaxes the incredulous boy
through candid kitchens in the rising sun
to seek the staircase by the glare of day
hand in hand, they scale meridian,
clambering up the creaking heights of heat
until she hears the twittering machine
juvenilia
which quaintly wove the fabric of her fate
behind the zodiac on attic door
with abracadabra from the alphabet
pointing toward the spindles cryptic whir,
she tells the greenhorn miner to bow down
and honor the great goddess of the air
suspended aloft within her planetshine
laughing aloud, the dazzled boy demands
why he should kneel before a silly scene
where pigeons promenade the gableends
and coo quadrilles about the blighted core
in a batch of raveled apple rinds
at his words, the indignant godmother
vanishes in a labyrinth of hay
while sunlight winds its yarn upon the floor
o never again will the extravagant straw
knit up a gilded fable for the child
who weeps before the desolate tableau
of clockwork that makes the royal blood run cold
touchandgo
sing praise for statuary
for those anchored attitudes
and staunch stone eyes that stare
through lichenlid and passing birdfoot
at some steadfast mark
beyond the inconstant green
gallop and flick of light
in this precarious park
where vivid children twirl
like colored tops through time
nor stop to understand
how all their play is touchandgo
but, go they cry, and the swing
arcs up to the tall tree tip
go and the merrygoround
hauls them round with it
juvenilia
and i, like the children, caught
in the mortal active verb,
let my transient eye break a tear
for each quick, flaring game
of child, leaf and cloud,
while on this same fugue, unmoved,
those stonier eyes look,
safesocketed in rock
temper of time
an ill wind is stalking
while evil stars whir
and all the gold apples
go bad to the core
black birds of omen
now prowl on the bough
with a hiss of disaster
sibyls leaves blow
through closets of copses
tall skeletons walk
nightshade and nettles
tangle the track
in the ramshackle meadow
where kilroy would pass
lurks the sickleshaped shadow
of snake in the grass
approaching his cottage
by crooked detour,
he hears the gruff knocking
of the wolf at the door
his wife and his children
hang riddled with shot,
theres a hex on the cradle
and death in the pot

epitaph in three parts

rocking across the lapis lazuli sea
comes a flock of bottle battleships
each with a telegram addressed to me
destroy your mirror and avoid mishaps,
chirps the first live on a silent island
where the water blots out all footsteps
the second sings receive no roving gallant
who seeks to dally in the port till dawn,
for your fate involves a dark assailant
the third cries out as all the ships go down
there is more than one good way to drown
in the air above my island flies
a crowd of shining gulls that plunge to launch
an accurate assault upon the eyes
of the bold sailor falling under drench
and hunger of the surf that plucks the land,
devouring green gardens inch by inch
blood runs in a glissando from the hand
that lifts to consecrate the sunken man
aloft, a lone gull halts upon the wind,
announcing after glutted birds have flown
there is more than one good way to drown

grasshopper goblins with green pointed ears
caper on leafstalk legs across my doorsill,
and mock the jangling rain of splintered stars
my room is a twittering gray box with a wall
there and there and there again, and then
a window which proves the sky sheer rigmarole
juvenilia
that happens to conceal the lid of one
enormous box of gray where god has gone
and hidden all the bright angelic men
a wave of grass engraves upon the stone
there is more than one good way to drown
